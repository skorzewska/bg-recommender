	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]I have enjoyed the different 10 Days games I&#039;ve played more than I thought I would, but the Asia map is probably my least favorite. I really don&#039;t like the bottlenecks that exist on this map; there can potentially be a lot of dead ends on this map. Also the map is basically cut in 2 by one country unless you use a boat or plane which makes you feel like you have very limited options on some of your turns. Our game devolved into everyone looking for a specific boat turn after turn without being able to change anything on our racks without having to replace a lot of tiles. I did enjoy the game, but I&#039;d rather play any of the other maps over this one[/i]</comment>				</item>

- Quick and easy to learn/teach.
- This is a great gateway/filler game. 
- This game could be used to help kids learn some basic geography. 
- This is a quick game (about 30 minutes) making it ideal for those nights when there is a time crunch.
- Turns also play very fast, so there is not a lot of downtime.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Received in a math trade (5/15/14).

[i]- Great theme, with beautiful production values.
- Simple game play and easy to teach, but man this game has lots of depth.
- The card play for movement/ special actions is great. You can move any armies, but only a limited number and only so many spaces.
- The dice based combat is perfect, units can flee (which you get back later) or you may be able to move an army to an adjacent space. 
- I could write a novel about how amazing this game is, if you are interested at all check out some of the reviews.
- The 4p game has you play in teams: with each side being composed of 2 armies (The British Regulars and British Loyalists on one side and the Continental Army and Colonial Militia being the other). You each control an army and you decide how to move armies that contain at least one of your units making it very important to talk with your ally.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>44</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Beautiful artwork on the cards which helps the theme come through.
- Plays well with 3+ players.
- Quick playtime (under 45 minutes) even once you add more players.
- Card drafting made extremely accessible, this is an easy game to teach.
- I enjoy building a tableau of cards that builds on itself and allows you to obtain better cards.
- There are enough different ways to win which helping to give this game good replay value.
- Great game to begin/end a game night.[/i]

[i]I will mention that my wife really enjoys clean game design without lots of fiddlyness, so sometimes when we add an expansion to a game she does not care for it because they will typically add some amount of complexity.
This was not the case with the 7 Wonders expansions. 
She really enjoyed both expansions because they did not break/or change the rules of the game. The expansions really extend and add to already existing powers/effects.
Overall I really enjoy both expansions, and what they bring to the table.

However; if you are only going to get one I would get the Leaders expansion. 
I really like how the leader powers affect all the different phases of the game (resource generation, money, victory points, military strength, science, etc.).[/i]

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]First I have to admit that the hype surrounding this game has probably effected how I feel about it. I was expecting a similarly amaziing experience to the first time I played 7 Wonders and it actually kind of fell flat. I understand all the decisions that were made to add tension into the 2p game, but I&#039;m not sure that I like them. 

Specifically I&#039;m talking about the alternate victory conditions, winning via military or science. While this adds a lot of interaction and tension in the game, there are times when your hands are tied and you need to select a card you don&#039;t want because you&#039;ve already let your opponent collect too much military or science. This isn&#039;t really fun or very strategic, in fact it&#039;s pretty straight forward. There is also a fair bit of randomness in the game for 2 reasons, first you have o idea what the face down cards are so your opponent can get a huge boon if the right card gets revealed, on top of that 3 cards are removed from each age at the beginning of the round. It is surprising how much those 3 cards have effected our games, in one game one of the science symbols was completely out of the game and in another I was strapped for resources the whole game because a lot of resource cards were removed from the game. 
There are ways to help mitigate the luck found in the game which I&#039;ll highlight below:

- The drafting pyramids you build create some tense decisions when choosing which card to take, but also introduces a lot of randomness since you have no idea which card(s) you&#039;ll be revealing for your opponent.
- The wonders do help mitigate the randomness of the game, especially the wonders that give you another turn.
- You can mitigate a lack of resources if you focus on getting cards that have the upgrade symbols.
- The guilds are quite powerful because you can choose whether to use your tableau of cards or your opponents when figuring out the VP/coins that are generated.

Where does that leave me, I&#039;m really not sure. Considering how much my family enjoys 7 Wonders (one of my son&#039;s favorites) I&#039;m willing to give 7W Duel more plays and my gut feeling is that the more I play the less random the game will feel. In the end I think I&#039;ll always prefer 7 Wonders, but it is nice to have a quick, 2 player version in our collection. It&#039;ll be interesting how I feel about this one a year from now.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Abyss[/COLOR] was traded away in a math trade 1/12/15. (Received Wasabi)

My thoughts:

[i]- One of the most beautiful games I have ever seen, really, the art is amazing.
- Top notch components as well (especially the pearls and seashell cups to hold them).
- Some interesting interactions between the lords/locations.

Basically Abyss is a set collection game with all kinds of special abilities which effect game play and scoring, but a lot of your strategy is dictated by the randomness of the lord/location draws. I prefer games like Battle Line or Morels which allow for more long term planning and bluffing; games where you have knowledge of what cards are available and knowing you will most likely see every card in the game.

In my opinion Abyss is an average game with beautiful artwork. I think it works well as a family game if you are looking for a relatively light game with a fair amount of randomness. For me the decision space felt too constrained and not very deep.[/i]

[i]- I really enjoy balancing the feeding of your people with managing the rest of your farm.
- Theme: I really enjoy building a farm and seeing how everything looks at the end of the game. 
- Beautiful artwork and amazing bits (if you upgrade them, which I did directly through Lookout Games).
- Card play: They can really push you to try a different strategy in the game, since they give you a small advantage in one part of the game.
- High replay value: There are a lot of cards and different decks of cards to explore in this game.[/i]

- Components and art are top notch, love the animeeples.
- I enjoy seeing what our farms look like after the game, we always have a story as to what kind of farm we created. 
(I always feel bad having 10 sheep crammed into a stable).
- The expansion buildings really make you think outside of the box as you plan your farm. 
- 30 minute play time packed with strategy.
- Extremely high replay value once you add the expansion buildings (I can&#039;t believe we&#039;ve played this 50+ times).[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>[i]- An amazing expansion that makes a great game even better!
- I really appreciate how the game unfolds now, it isn&#039;t necessary to max out your family/house to remain competitive because now you have to heat your home.
- The addition of horses also adds another way to score some serious points (each horse = 1 point without a cap).
- The variable board set up in the beginning of the game also impacts how you&#039;re going to play your game (your farm now has 8 spaces filled with bogs and forests that need to be removed if you want to use those spaces on your farm).
- I know some players aren&#039;t in love with the new major/minor cards, but since I&#039;m not playing to always score the most points I really enjoy the variety they add. A lot of them take advantage of the new additions to the game that this expansion adds.
- As much as I like the occupations I actually enjoy the game more just focusing on minor/major improvements and the forests/bogs. It is definitely easier for my kids to focus there stratedy and the additional action cards you get are great too because they can really help you jump start your engine.

I couldn&#039;t be happier with this expansion and I can&#039;t imagine playing Agricola without it. It may be the best expansion I own, it adds that much to the game play. I would highly recommend getting it if you want to breath new life into Agricola.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>[i]The first thing I want to mention is the art, I actually appreciate the fact that the publisher went through the effort to get all French artwork for this deck. There are some beautiful images. 

On to the deck itself, (I&#039;ve only played 2p so please take that into account). I love the cards in this game and how they really encourage you to explore different paths to victory. There is a lot of synergy between the cards, in all of our plays we&#039;ve gotten out more cards than usual. 

Right now I would probably say this is my favorite Agricola deck, I&#039;m looking forward to exploring it further.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Another excellent family weight game [i](probably a step up from TTR)[/i], but still very easy to teach to new gamers.
- Beautiful production quality and components, the board looks great as you fill it up with the airplanes.
- Each turn you can take 1 of 4 possible actions [i](simple right?)[/i], but that decision is never easy since the scoring cards always seem to come up one round too soon.
- I really appreciate the hidden scoring combined with the variable round ends create a very tense game where every decision is extremely important.[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]Boy was I wrong about this one, after playing 3 times I still never felt like I had a good grasp of the rules ([i] way to many ambiguities, especially with the scoring cards)[/i] and it just ended up sitting on the shelf until I traded it.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Beautiful components [i](the temples look great on the board)[/i], love the art style and the art really pops off the glossy tiles.
- Excellent combination of tile laying, route building and pick up and deliver.
- Really interesting use of the spacial elements of the board by having to build temples on a specific island that meets all of the temple placement rules of a card.
- Tough choices to make since you are concerned with not only the route you are building, but also the placement of the symbol on the board.
- Race element; at a certain point in the game you really start to feel pressure to stockpile money and build temples as the islands without temples built become scarce.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Condition: Very good

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]This was a game my wife and I enjoyed, but our kids never got into it. The much prefer the tile laying found in Carcassonne or the route building in Ticket to Ride (both are different games, but fill a similar niche in our collection). I ended up trading this away because my wife and I did not enjoy the 2 player variant. In the end I am sad to see this go, but I know it would just sit on our shelves.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (9):

[i]- Tile laying/ building your city, which is always a hit in my house.
- Having to figure out the layout of your alhambra in order to extend the outer walls.
- Simplicity of choices: buy tiles, take money and add/place tiles from your reserve.
- $ management: you need to buy tiles with specific colored money and if you pay exact change you get another turn.
- Uncertain scoring rounds which adds some tension to when you want to lay tiles versus stockpile cash.
- The anniversary edition has beautiful components with a really nice board. It is too bad this is not the standard edition that Queen puts out.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[i]I have been wanting to play this for years and my buddy Mat let me borrow it to play with my kids. I really thought they would love it and I thought I would like it a lot more than Kingsburg.

After playing for over an hour I could tell that my kids were getting bored (mind you long games are not an issue with my kids, they&#039;ll sit and play Agricola with me). In the end nothing about the game grabbed them and they felt like they were repeating the same actions over and over and I kind of agree. There really isn&#039;t much variety in the actions you can take. Also waiting for each person to place all their dice gets old fast, especially by the time my daughter had 7 dice. I much prefer Kingsburg because there are a lot more choices you can make when placing your dice (a total of 16 advisers versus maybe 8 - 10 spaces in AF).

I would play it again if someone requested it, but it&#039;s not a game I would consider adding to our collection (I am grateful that I got a chance to try it out before buying it).[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]- Great family game with easy to teach rules.
- Love the art on the cards, and while unrealistic I wish the cards were bigger to show off the art.
- Card drafting, this is a mechanic I love and I think AtS pulls it off quite well.
- Love the spacial aspect of building your space station, actual card placement is critical to being successful in this game.
- Having to balance your power supply adds another dimension to consider when building your space station.[/i]

[i]- The ambassadors elevates AtS from a good game to a great game.
- The ambassadors add another much needed choice to the base game, now you can choose to invite an ambassador to your space station.
- The ambassador powers open up some really interesting ways to manipulate tiles already built in your space station.
- A lot of new basic locations and special locations which really cranck up the variability of the game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]- Amazing artwork, I would love to get prints of some of these images.
- Awesome 2p experience, great couples game to play at a cafe or pub.
- This is one of those chill games for us, you can&#039;t help but feel peaceful looking your tableau of cards.
- I enjoy the added complexity in how you can sequence different card types as you build your arboretum. (It reminds me of Lost Cities and Musee but the placement of cards is not as constrained.)[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I enjoyed my one play of this and would play it again if requested, but I would much rather play a host of other card games that invovle set collection elements. 
I really hated the sandstorm and thief cards, they added way to much chaos and randomness to the game. There is no way to mitigate their effects. In the end you could play a great game and then a thief or sandstorm hits and completely ruins your plans.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]I may end up being in the minority with this one and possibly my judgement is clouded by having played so many dice placement games, but Artifacts fell flat for me. I really don&#039;t have much to say because the game has a narrow decision space where everything is the same. Sure you can collect different types of artifacts, but they all function the same so it&#039;s a matter of getting what you can with the dice rolled. There also didn&#039;t seem to be much variation in the cards you could buy and the spacial aspect of the game was interesting, but again very limited in what you could do based on the placement rules. 

I did enjoy the art, it would have been cool to have different pieces for the artifacts especially since the theme really doesn&#039;t come through int he game play. It ends up being a typical Euro optimization game with beautiful artwork. I would play it again if asked, but definitely won&#039;t seek it out.[/i]

My thoughts:

[i]May be my biggest disappointment of 2015 so far. I&#039;m keeping my comments short and sweet on this one. First off I love the use of dice in this game to manage your mana, but you can get hosed if your playing a deck that has a lot of top tier mana requirements. Yes you can discard a card to change a die value, but that is costly and you really can&#039;t afford to keep doing that throughout the game. Still I had fun managing my dice pool, but is something to be aware of going in. 

I have 1 major gripe with the game though. I do not enjoy deckbuilding, especially in games I&#039;m playing with my kids. I knew going in that was a big part of this game, but I expected the base factions to be better balanced against one another. Summoner Wars, (another PH game) is extremely well balanced when playing just the base faction decks. In Ashes some decks will more often than not get destroyed by other decks and I&#039;m not interested in figuring out how to balance the base game decks. I&#039;m not a fan of the LCG model, but as with Summoner Wars, I would have been happy buying new factions that I wanted if I thought PH was making efforts to balance all of the basic decks. 

I have one other minor conern, after a few plays with each deck strategies become apparent and games become very samey. Again I realize that building decks alleviates this, but I expected more variety, balance and replay value from the basic decks in Ashes (Imperial Settlers pulls this off exceptionally well so it can be done).[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>[i]Need to wait for the hype to die down and really decide if I want to add this to the collection. Looks pretty good, not sure if I want to buy into this type of game though.[/i]</wishlistcomment></item>

[i]- Great theme, with beautiful production from the artwork to all the wooden vegimeeples.
- Another Uwe game that plays awesome with 2 and doesn&#039;t involve feeding anyone.
- The card drafting system is really tense because you are discarding cards to a common pool that both players can choose from. However; the twist is that you must choose a card from the common pool and your hand.
- There is something therapeutic about planting fields of vegetables and then harvesting them. It is a tense game, but somehow I stay very relaxed while playing.
- Great variety of card types (long term customers, one time customers, market stands and helpers) and character abilties on the helper cards.
- Figuring out how to optimally fulfill orders to customers while also making sure you are going to continue to harvest the vegetables you need is a great, brain burning puzzle you have to figure out each turn.[/i]

	<numplays>23</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Ballon Cup[/COLOR] was sold via auction 11/5/15.
Received in a math trade (8/8/14). 

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]Out of all the games I played this month, this is the one that stood the test of time. As soon as I played it I began looking for a copy and was lucky enought to get one in a math trade (As a quick aside I had no interest in the Piñata reprint because the art is terrible). 

However; We now play by the designer&#039;s original rules (found in this thread) and it makes a great game even better. In a nutshell you can&#039;t play cards on your opponents side of a tile until your side of the tile has the necessary number of cards. This really adds a lot more strategy to the game and makes the game feel like more of a race.

Balloon Cup has been a hit with everyone in my family, but especially with my older daughter. This is her most requested game when we&#039;re looking for a short game to play. I would highly recommend this game if you can find a copy, this is one of the older Kosmos 2p games that has stood the test of time (The only reason it is an 8 is because I would still choose Battle Line first when looking to play this type of game).

Even though I still think Balloon Cup is a solid game, we have way too many 2p card games and I&#039;d always rather play Battle Line so it ended up getting sold.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (9):

[i]- Excellent 2p cafe game, very compact.
- My wife really enjoyed playing this game, it falls right into her sweet spot for games.
- Beautiful artwork, nice components.
- Easy to learn/teach.
- There is a lot of strategy because you are allowed to play on your opponents side of the tile/board which leads to some interesting choices when deciding where to play certain cards.[/i]</comment>				</item>

I would much rather play King of Tokyo for a dice fest attacking game or Coup/Cockroach poker for a bluffing game.
I find it mediocre in both categories.

I would like to play this again, I could see it being fun during family get togethers.</comment>				</item>

[i]- The best negotiation/bluffing filler I&#039;ve played [i](games last about 20 minutes tops and it is easy to teach)[/i].
- Amazing how much game has been condensed down into a deck of cards and some jewels, perfect pub/cafe game. 
- My favorite mechanism in the game: 1 person selects an action - they get it, 2 people - they negotiate who will get it by giving gems to the other player, 3 or more people - no one gets anything!
- You constantly second guess every choice because you are not only worried about what action you want to take, but what other people may be interested in (too many people choose it and you get zilch)[/i].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Thank you Ralph for teaching/playing the game with me.
I played a prototype version of this game and had fun.
Another take on deck building with a baseball theme. 
The game play was quick and I really liked how you could recruit new players onto your team between each match.

While I thought the game was fun I am probably not the intended audience for a few reasons.
The first being my general dislike for deck builders, I think they are fun at first but I very quickly burn out on them.
Second the baseball theme does nothing for me, especially with the robot/cyborg element they threw in.

While I had fun playing the game, nothing really jumped out at me.
In some ways it felt like a game that I had played before just with a different theme [i](which was okay, but I wouldn&#039;t really enjoy playing on the side of the devil)[/i].
The strongest part of the game for me is the artwork they used; awesome.

	<numplays>30</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Another great 2p game that plays quick but offers lots of strategy.
- Interesting take on basic poker mechanics being used to gain a majority of flags (scoring markers) on the table (5 or 3 that are all next to each other.)
- Tactics cards: help add an amount of uncertainty to the game; it becomes harder to make sure that you really have a flag scored. They let you manipulate the cards you have played in some interesting ways, but they are well balanced because you can only play one more tactics card than your opponent has played.[/i]</comment>				</item>

- The rules take a little time to get straight, but once you get them down the game flows smoothly. I ended up appreciating how the different phases were split up.
- I really appreciate how upgrades are used in this game, whether it is buying a gnome to unlock a building ability or turning one of your dwarves or elves into a &quot;super&quot; dwarf which will collect more resources for you [i](but still only counts for one when determining majorities)[/i].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Biblios[/COLOR] was sold via auction 4/4/15. 
Received in a math trade 11/10/14.

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]In the end, for my wife and I, this game didn&#039;t stand up to repeated play. Most of my plays were with 2 and I definitely think Biblios plays better with more, so I am quite surprised that it&#039;s so highly recommended for 2. The drafting of cards worked well with 2, but I found the dice manipulation to usually be a back and forth affair with very little difference in the numbers (most of our 2p games ended with a bunch of 3&#039;s and maybe a 2 and 4 thrown in). With 3 or 4 I t would gladly play it, but since it was mainly a 2p game I played with my wife I ended up trading it.

*I lowered my rating to a 6 based on the 2p experience, with 3 or 4 I would rate it an 8 and highly recommend playing it. [/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- An auction game that plays very well with 2
- An excellent cafe game [i](small footprint)[/i]
- Easy to teach since you can teach each phase of the game separately [i](drafting/auction phases) [/i]
- Interesting draft mechanic [i](you must choose a card for yourself, the auction piple and put cards out for the other players to choose)[/i].
- Dice manipulation: the whole game hinges on adjusting the value of the dice, the tricky part is when do you do it.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Edition - English 2014 (white bordered cards)

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Black Fleet[/COLOR] was traded away for Diamant 12/10/14. 

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]This ended up being a huge disappointment. The game is beautifully produced, but in the end lacked any real staying power. Our subsequent plays ended up feeling very similar, there just wasn&#039;t enough variety in the cards or decisions you had to make. It was also much lighter than it first appeared, as we realized the decision space was much more limited than what we first thought and the game became boring and definitely outstayed its welcome (an hour is way too long for the decisions you make in this game.

It&#039;s certainly been well received by the gaming community and maybe I would recommend it if you are looking for a light, family game and the theme appeals to you. Personally though, we&#039;ve found other games released around the same time to be much better (Camel Up and Rattlebones spring to mind).[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Absolutely beautiful production, the ships are amazing (they hold the cargo in them) and who doesn&#039;t love metal coins?
- The board/cards have great cartoony artwork which works well in a family game.
- Excellent family game that is easy to teach and plays in under an hour.
- Plays great with 3, there is still plenty of pirate shenanigans taking place.
- Light intro into pick up and deliver games.
- Special cards are really fun to combo together and create a mega turn were you are making $ and sinking ships left and right.
- The powers on the cards you purchase with doubloons are all different, adding to the replay value of this game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]This one started out strong and ended up fizzling out after more plays. What really soured me on the game was the lack of variety in how the game played out. Even though the layout of buildings changed from game to game it really didn&#039;t change much. It basically just meant you were looking for different colored cards to play. The 2p experience was okay, but there was a lot less conflict over who was going to build each building and the game devolved into a race with a predictable outcome of who would score the last cube in the tower. 

It sounds like I really don&#039;t like the game, which isn&#039;t true, I&#039;m just not interested in keeping games in our collection that will only get played once or twice a year and that&#039;s about how often I&#039;d want to play BMC. However; if someone else pulled out a copy I&#039;d happily play.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- I love the artwork on the tiles (the buildings), most of the characters (there are a few that I really don&#039;t care for) and the dragon pieces are great.
- Plays well with 2, although it does become even more of a race where you may try to build each site on your own.
- An interesting twist on area control, since you can build where someone else has you may be able to share in some of the benefits for building that site.
- Dragons: the addition of the dragons/scales adds another layer of depth to the game because you can get quite a few crystals if you have the majority of scales.
- Cube management: my son and I played a 2p game and I almost lost because I did not have a cube left to build in the temple.
- Hand management and all the different card powers/combos.
- Random tile layout: This really changes how you play the game since getting adjacent building bonuses can be very important.

This is an excellent game that really deserves a reprint, I really haven&#039;t played anything quite like it.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I really enjoyed playing this game and I would love to play it again.
A different take on a card based combat game, with Summoner Wars being one of my favorite 2p card based combat games.
While I would gladly play it anytime it was brought out, I do not think my family would enjoy it too much because they would not want to invest the time into learning all the different decks (especially since they have done this to some extent with Summoner Wars). 
For this reason I doubt I will end up buying it.</comment>				</item>

[i]I highly recommend this game for families getting into the hobby.[/i]

Highlights:
- Great gateway/family game, especially if you are interested in a game that focuses on trading.
- Encourages trading every turn [i](it is very rare for someone to keep both cards they flip, usually at least one gets traded).[/i]
- Best mechanic in the game [i](which also helps drive trading)[/i] is not being able to rearrange your hand, ever.
- Very easy to teach/learn.
- I like the cartoony artwork and the card quality is excellent.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[i]Overall very uninspiring 2p variant of Love Letter; not a game I need to play again. I enjoyed my first play, but after playing it again it just fell flat. I am starting to realize that I really don&#039;t care for micro games that play in a few minutes and I&#039;m not interested in playing multiple rounds of this game. Instead I would rather play a quick dice filler like [thing=117942][/thing], [thing=111148][/thing] or stick with [thing=129622][/thing].[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This was a tough one for me to rate because I did enjoy the game play. I love the theme (being a huge craft beer fan) and I love WP games, so I asked myself why it fell flat for me. I ended up basing my rating on where Brew Crafters would fit into the WP games I really enjoy [i](specifically my two favorites - [thing=31260][/thing] and [thing=118048][/thing]).[/i] 

[i]Thoughts on Agricola versus Brew Crafters:[/i]

A lot of people are comparing it to Agricola and I don&#039;t think they feel that similar. BC does not have nearly the amount of variability during set up that Agricola has (due to the occupation and minor improvement cards in Agricola). There is also not the same tension in BC, yes you have to pay your employees but that is much easier to accomplish as opposed to feeding your family in Agricola.
The similarities to Agricola are similar game length and weight plus the fact that both are WP games. If I want to play a heavier WP game I would choose Agricola because I love how the cards you get in the beginning of a game of Agricola can completely change how you will play the game compared to other plays you&#039;ve had. 

[i]Thoughts on Targi versus Brew Crafters:[/i]

Why Targi you ask... because Targi offered something brand new to the WP genre when it came out, the spacial element of placing workers to get certain goods/tribe cards. All of this is packed into a 1 hour experience [i](including set up).[/i]
I had fun playing Brew Crafters, but it felt like more of the same without offering anything new to the experience. I haven&#039;t played with 2 yet, but a 3p and 4p game took a few hours to play and there were plenty of turns where my optimal move was quite apparent. 

[i]In closing, while I enjoyed my plays of Brew Crafters it doesn&#039;t stand up to the variability of Agricola or the innovation of Targi.
I will happily play again, but it is not a game I feel the need to add to my collection.[/i]

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Mat had a print and play copy he made.
In some ways this game reminded me of Morels with some additional cards to vary how you can score points.
I will admit to having had a few choice brews by this point so I really need to play it again.
I think this would be another game my wife would like.

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>[i]- The artwork is beautiful and whimsical which really drew my daughter into the game.
- The production is top notch all around[i] (great wooden potions, great card stock  and the tiles are nice and thick) which isn&#039;t always the case with Ravensberger games.[/i] 
- The combination of role selection and pick up and deliver is clever and really engaging [i](I&#039;m not aware of other games that have combined these mechanisms).[/i]
- This is definitely a great [i]&quot;next step&quot;[/i] family game as long as everyone doesn&#039;t mind a fair dose of chaos in their games.
- Flexibility is key and you need to make sure you can do a few different things with the roles you select, even if some of those plans are less than ideal. 
- There can be turns where certain roles may be useless if you need other roles to be resolved first.

I&#039;m interested to see how it handles a lower player count, especially 2p, because my daughter really wants to play again. I&#039;ll update mt initial thoughts once we play it at other player counts.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Highlights:
- Theme; this is what really drew me into the game. 
- Learning the game was easy because all of your actions tied in quite well with the theme.
- Similar to Terra Mystica this is another heavy game that offers a variety of strategies to explore over multiple plays.
- Loved how the board where you can place workers only has a certain section available for each round.
- Bidding mechanic: On top of that when selecting a location for your worker you are bidding for majority in that column in order to receive the benefit of a card at the end of the column.
- Patrons: you can collect patrons that will give you different abilities which will typically help you with one of the scoring areas.
- Worker placement with set collection and area majority.</comment>				</item>

- Great components and I prefer the new art style over the old one.
- Simple to teach, I haven&#039;t had any problem teaching this.
- I like the draft that takes place at the end of each round to divy up the loot.
- Plays with 4 to 8 players [i](and it still plays quick with 8)[/i].

I can&#039;t recommend this highly enough as a great party game to play with friends and family. This game will continue to see lots of play whenever we have people over.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Cacao[/COLOR] was sold via auction 8/8/15.

Updated thoughts and rating [COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]:

[i]This ended up having very limited replay potential for my family and I. We got in a bunch of plays right away and then lost all interest in playing. This game is really light and the decisions aren&#039;t as interesting as Carcassonne for us, mostly because in Cacao there isn&#039;t the same kind of interaction that farmers cause in Carc.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- The first tile laying game that I would put in the filler category.
- It plays fast (20 minutes tops) and has enough decisions to remain engaging. 
- Worker placement tiles are a great idea, you activate the tiles you place your worker tiles next to if there are workers facing that tile.
- Excellent production values, everything is top notch (thick tiles/ player boards, and really nice cacao pieces). 
- I really like the theme/artwork, it is simple but still beautiful to look at.[/i]

[i]After playing a few times I believe Camel Up definitely deserved to win the Spiel award. This is a game that you really have to play, reading about it will not get across just how much fun this game can be. This game is all about the experience of playing it!

Highlights:
- Awesome family/party game that can be taught to anyone in minutes.
- Components are top notch, the camel meeples are awesome!
- Fun... really fun. [i](Seriously; this game is a blast to play, trust me!)[/i]
- There is just enough happening with the camels (due to the stacking mechanism) to keep this game engaging and unpredictable, which makes each turn exciting.[/i]</comment>				</item>

My thoughts:

[i]I can&#039;t fault the expansion as much as I fault myself for picking this up. Supercup does offer some interesting twists on the game play that make the game a bit more tactical, but in doing so I think it raises the barrier to entry and sucks out some of the fun we&#039;ve had playing the game. Since this has been a game that we&#039;ve brought out with extended family, I couldn&#039;t see us getting much play out of the expansion so I ended up trading it.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]I ended up trading this because the game really drags with 4 and it has since been Jones Theoried by other games in our collection; Diamant if I&#039;m looking for push your luck or Qwixx for a quick dice filler.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8.5):

[i]- The most fun push your luck game I have played!
- Nice components with a cool stop sign board.
- Lots of dice rolling 
- Everyone gets excited during each turn... &quot;Come on just one more roll&quot;
-This is a great family/gateway game.[/i]
- You could easily play this with younger kids as well.

Great game I originally bought to play with my wife.
She loved it but what surprised me was how much my kids enjoy it as well.
This is a great family game, and what is most surprising is that my wife is probably the most cutthroat player closely followed by my son.
This game has a very easy to learn rule set but there is a surprising amount of depth for a tile laying game.
This really is the game that every family should have.

This is a game we have played with a lot of people who don&#039;t typically play or enjoy games. 
My in-laws played it one night at our house and they bought it the next day!</comment>	<conditiontext>Condition: The box shows some shelf wear, but the tiles and meeples are in excellent condition.

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]The hidden scoring ended up introducing way to much randomness and fluctuation in the scoring. It is way too easy to get a couple of 0&#039;s while someone else gets a few 5&#039;s. I originally liked the idea of a hidden scoring element, but it was too random for my taste.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Great theme, artwork and components (cowboy meeples) that will definitely draw kids in. 
- Simplified farmer scoring, you now look for tepees and horses on the tiles which score you 2 and 4 points respectively.
- Mining tokens which you collect these tokens when finishing a mountain, tents which allow you to steal these tokens before a mountain is finished.
- Railroad tracks can now score like inns (2p per tile instead of 1) if you have 1 train on a section of track.
- The Sheriff mini expansion adds a few excellent editions to the game play,

*As of now this is my favorite version of Carcassonne (I&#039;ve owned the base game with expansions, the winter version and South Seas). The mining tokens add a bit of randomness to the game (they can score you 0 to 5 points, typically 1 or 2), but I actually like having some hidden scoring in the game. [/i]</comment>				</item>

My thoughts:

[i]This adds a few tweaks to the game play. The Sheriff stops people from stealing mining tokens with their tents so you can protect a mountain you control that has a lot of mining tokens. It also adds graveyards which function like monasteries in the original Carcassonne with the added benefit of scoring more points for each city tile it is adjacent to.[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]Played one time 2p, I think the sheep and hills would be interesting when playing with more players. The additional points for cloisters with the vineyards is okay, but nothing earth shattering. Since I play this game mostly 2p, I think this expansion plus Inns and Cathedrals is too much. There are too many tiles and it extends the game too much for me. I still prefer just the base game plus Inns.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition, only played once.

Love how this expansion adds a little more depth to the base game, some great new tiles but it does not burden the game with too many new rules.

Received in a trade 4/30/14.

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]South Seas was fun, specifically I liked how you traded goods for ships (which are your points) and the fishing mechanism. However; the theme/art wasn&#039;t my cup of tea and really detracted from the experience for me. I also didn&#039;t care for the tile distribution, there never seemed to be enough jungle tiles. 

Now that I own Carcassonne: Gold Rush (the 2nd game in the Around the World series) I am content not having South Seas in my collection any longer. I prefer the theme and new game play variations found in Gold Rush more than those found in South Seas.

At this point I am interested in trying Carcassonne: H&amp;G which seems to offer a nice variation in game play from the base game and Gold Rush. I don&#039;t miss having South Seas in my collection, but if the theme appeals to you I think it offers solid, new mechanisms to the Carcassonne formula.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Quick playtime (a 2p game takes about 25 minutes).
- Scoring: You are collecting resources [i](seashells, fish and bananas)[/i] which you trade in for ship tiles (which have values from 2 to 6 points). There is no need for a clunky scoring track.
- The artwork is excellent and it includes nice wooden seashells, bananas and fish.

This is the third version of Carcassonne I have owned [i](I have the Winter version and traded away the original with Inns and Cathedrals) [/i] and I would consider it the easiest to teach new players. I find the scoring to be much more clear cut since there are no farmers and the fishermen (which replaced farmers) are easier to score.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]Carcassonne is one of my wife&#039;s favorite games so I thought she would like the winter version, turns out she prefers the original with Inns and Cathedrals.
Since we only need one version of Carcassonne I traded this one away (another victim of the Jones theory).
I still loved the artwork in this edition, especially the tiles with animals.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (7.5):

[i]We live in the NE were snow is plentiful so I love the new art. Also the animals added to some of the tiles are beautiful, especially the birds. I also like how the roads are more organic and not perfect curves. The simple addition of the gingerbread man adds some meaningful decisions to the game. You can score quite a few points with him if you plan well. There is also a larger tile selection than the base game, including a better variety of tiles with different shapes/features.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Traded away for Agricola 7/17/14. 
Reacquired in a math trade 3/21/15.

[i]This is the third Feld game I have played, the others are Bruges and Notre Dame. As of now Notre Dame may be my favorite, but it is currently out of print. I am not sure how I feel about his games yet, which means that I don&#039;t know if I like point salad games.
I need to play all of these more before I make up my mind, so on some level I definitely enjoy them.

I like Castles but I need more plays before I decide whether it is a keeper or not. I do enjoy how the dice are used to determine what you can do on a turn. And I always enjoy finding ways to maximize points, but as of yet I feel like the game is a bit random. Also the components are mediocre at best.

This is definitely one I want to return to and I look forward to teaching my wife.[/i]

My thoughts:

[i]This was another disappointment, I specifically asked Time Well Spent to bring this in and they did ([i]awesome service btw![/i]). I was really excited to get this and it finally came in. It really is just a combination of Yahtzee and Connect Four. 

My problems with the game is that it is either over really fast [i](with very little excitement)[/i] or it completely overstays it&#039;s welcome. It is missing the tension and push your luck aspect of Cant Stop and the extremely quick playing time and constant engagement of Qwixx. On a positive note this game can be taught in less than a minute and could be played with anyone, this is a very light game. However; this game is not for us and I will be trading it away.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[i]This is the first game published by Drei Majier Spiele that has fallen flat as a game. The dexterity element of the game is fun (trying to place all your sticks to the star, which has a few magnets, or place sticks on top of other sticks), but in practice there end up being these big stacks of sticks because it is so easy to place them there. The scoring is counter intuitive for a kids game, eventually sticks fall and you&#039;ll have to collect some of them for negative points. The person with the least amount of negative points wins. I don&#039;t think this type of scoring clicks with young kids. 

This will stick around for now, but more as an toy for my daughter to play with. If you are looking for a children&#039;s dexterity game that works as a game and a toy I would highly recommend Animal Upon Animal.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Caverna[/COLOR] was traded away for At The Gates of Loyang, Ninjato and Carcassonne South Seas (4/30/14).

[i]Having now played Agricola, I much prefer Agricola and do not regret this trade at all.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

*When I originally wrote this I hadn&#039;t played Agricola yet.

[i] I like Caverna, but I prefer Glass Road and for a lighter game Agricola ACBaS. I can&#039;t really explain it, it is fun to play but I do not feel the same sense of accomplishment at the end of the game that I get from Glass Road. In my opinion I feel like Glass Road is getting pushed to the side because it came out at the same time as Caverna. I much prefer the card play and resource management found in Glass Road. Maybe Caverna just feels like other WP games I have already played, albeit with a cool theme/wrapper and really nice components.

Will be interested to see how this game fares a year from now. Overall a solid game, but I am not on the hype wagon, go try Glass Road instead![/i]

One person ended up running away with it, but that didn&#039;t detract from the experience.
Definitely needs to be played with the right crowd or this game could become very boring, a game that it meant to be played quick.</comment>				</item>

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- A pure negotiation game that works extremely well in a family setting.
- Very easy to teach, clean rule set and you are engaged the whole game (there isn&#039;t any down time).
- I will mention that the game can get pretty intense because everyone is negotiating at the same time. (We slowed it down a bit so my daughter (9) wouldn&#039;t get overwhelmed.)
- Production is good (although I&#039;d prefer wooden discs to the plastic ones) and I appreciate the much smaller box.
- Not sure if I&#039;d play this with less than 4, I think it would fall flat.

I was very happy when whole family enjoyed Chinatown. Up to this point we have played Lords of Vegas, but I&#039;d been a bit weary of introducing a pure negotiation game because there isn&#039;t any luck involved, whereas in Lords of Vegas you have lots of die rolling which can swing the game in some unexpected ways. Because of that fact I definitely think there is room in our collection for both of these games, depending on what kind of mood we&#039;re in.

Both games are great fun, but the one thing Lords of Vegas has over Chinatown are those insane die rolls when everything is on the line and you could lose a huge casino to an opponent. However; I think Chinatown offers a more exciting negotiation environment because you are negotiating not only for the lots, but also the different business types which means you usually have something everyone else at the table wants.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Ciao, Ciao...[/COLOR] was sold via auction 8/8/15.

My thoughts:

[i]I took a flier on this game after hearing about it from a few people who&#039;s opinions seem to jive with mine. Unfortunately this was a miss for my family and I. It is a family weight bluffing game in the vein of Cockroach Poker except sometimes you have no choice but to lie (because you are rolling a custom die that has two x&#039;s on it, but you always have to declare a number between 1 - 4 to move your piece). It is dead simple to teach and relatively fun. 

The problem is Cockroach Poker came along after this game was designed and managed to one up Ciao Ciao. Cockroach is even easier to teach and there is never a point in the were you are forced to bluff (a mechanism that I don&#039;t care for). My whole family has also find Cockroach poker to be more fun partly because the stories now associated with all the different bugs. Cockroach also plays up to 6 (we&#039;ve played with 7) where as Ciao Ciao tops out at 4, so we can bust out Cockroach when we have friends and family over too. 

The bottom line is Ciao Ciao and Cockroach Poker fill the a very similar niche in our collection, and we all prefer Cockroach Poker, so Ciao Ciao will be leaving our collection. [/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Highlights:
- Perfect gateway/family weight pick up and deliver game.
- Beautiful board and artwork. I love the use of color in this game, everything pops. The wooden delivery trucks are awesome too.
- This plays great with 2, which is always a huge plus for me.
- Variable set up [i](each game the 5 towns will pay different amounts for certain goods)[/i] and multiple ways to win this game.*
 
*This game may seem random at first, but that is only if you are focused on collecting the order cards. You can also focus on delivering certain goods to the towns that are paying out high prices that game, which in turn will also put you in the running to collect the Most Popular Vendor point tiles.</comment>				</item>

I only got to play one game and it was the short version. I&#039;d definitely like to play more to really solidify my opinion of this one. Mat said he thought it went a bit long when you played the regular game and it suffered from downtime issues when playing with more than 2. Still I quite liked the way dice got manipulated, especially swapping out dice in order to get new dice that had different values/powers. 

I&#039;m not sure this game has legs, but I am excited to play again even though it dropped down on my wishlist.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>28</numplays>			<comment>[i]- My favorite bluffing game!
- Great gateway into bluffing games, I have been able to play this with lots of different people. 
- I am using this game as a stepping stone to eventually teach my wife and kids Coup (which is my favorite bluffing game).
- Plays fast, but there is definitely an interesting meta game that develops if you play with the same people.
- Great artwork!

I play with a few different groups, including my family, and each group plays this game differently. Certain bugs become taboo because of what has happened in previous games. My kids also figured out pretty quickly to pass specific cards around so that the last person is faced with a very difficult choice which could lead to them losing.

The fact that all of this naturally emerges from such a simple rule set is what makes this game brilliant and instantly accessible to everyone. There is nothing tacked on or convoluted. As much as I love Coup there is still a slight barrier to entry with people who don&#039;t game much. In fact even in one of my groups a few people really don&#039;t like the &quot;heavier&quot; bluffing games but love Cockroach Poker.

This game is a keeper and one I would recommend adding to anyone&#039;s collection.[/i]

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[i]Both of my plays were with 2 and I had a blast. I definitely think 4 or 6 would be the sweet spot for me. It can definitely induce some AP, especially when the board is fresh and you have to look at everything to make sure your clues aren&#039;t too broad. I could see busting this out with our extended family, but since those opportunities are infrequent I still would rather play games like Camel Up, Cash n&#039; Guns, Diamant or Cockroach Poker. I also think this would be a tough game for kids, especially if they were giving the clues (who knows though maybe I&#039;m completely wrong about that).

As of now definitely a game I&#039;d enjoy playing again, but probably not one I&#039;ll add to my collection anytime soon (although I am curious what my wife would think of it as a 2p game).[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]As much as I enjoyed this game my family did not. My original thoughts still hold true, but I ended up trading it away because it was not going to get played. The one thing everyone enjoyed was the trading/wheeling and dealing and once we got [thing=20437][/thing] I unfortunately knew it was all over for Colosseum. This just didn&#039;t click with my family and since we try to keep our collection lean it left.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (9):

[i]- Easy to teach to my family on our weekly game night.
- The theme is awesome and well integrated into the game.
- A great introduction to auctions and trading for a family game.
(We do not trade one at a time, but instead everyone trades at once).
- There is a helpful catch up mechanic for the person in last place that only affects the person in first (which actually adds some extra strategy into the game.
- The scoring: you only score your best round (out of 5).
- The artwork and production quality is top notch.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Colt Express[/COLOR] was sold via auction 11/5/15.
Received in a trade (6/1/15)

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Colt Express is a great family game that deserves to win the SDJ.
- Amazing components, the trains look awesome set up on the table.
- Wild west train robbers and programmed movement is a perfect paiiring of theme and game mechanism.
- A breeze to teach, you can teach this game as you go. 
In this game the more chaos the better, so no worries if anyone makes a &quot;mistake&quot; since you never know how things will shake out.
- It is FUN! (In a hobby that can be so serious it&#039;s great to play a game that is not afraid to be a bit unbalanced, player powers really vary, and quite chaotic.)

This isn&#039;t a game that I want to play all the time, but it is fun especially when playing with family and friends. It also pulls people in once it is set up on the table and it can be taught easily, you will be off and running in no time. I highly recommend this game if you play with your family a lot, my guess is your kids will love it![/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>[i]- I love the decision space in this game, planning out your colony expansion while managing your resources and income [i](pure Euro goodness)[/i].
- Plays great with 2; I just ordered the expansion map which should make the 2p experience even better.
- Card management; not only do the cards in your hand provide you with the actions you can take, they also have a scoring rule attached to them. You only score points based on the cards you collect.
- Low rules overhead, this is a very clean design.
(Once you start playing you have a card that lists the scoring opportunities and cost for establishing cities and that is about all yo need to reference while playing.)[/i]

The Grudge fed right into this, they allowed me to have a strong negotiation presence whenever I was involved in a conflict.

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Coup[/COLOR] was traded away in a math trade 9/21/14. (Received For Sale)

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]Coup got Jones Theoried in favor of the much more elegant Cockroach Poker. I have talked about this comparison a lot so I will be brief. Cockroach poker has very simple rules that allow the players to develop their own play style and meta game which makes Cockroach Poker instantly accessible to everyone. There is nothing tacked on or convoluted. 

As much as I have enjoyed Coup there is still a slight barrier to entry with people who don&#039;t game much. In fact even in one of my groups a few people really don&#039;t like the &quot;heavier&quot; bluffing games but love Cockroach Poker. Another major gripe I have with this game is that it can be over before it starts which isn&#039;t very exciting (and can&#039;t happen in Cockroach Poker).[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]Great bluffing game were the meta game develops very quickly. It doesn&#039;t take long before you start figuring out how you think other people are playing and then the accusations start flying. I really want the original version, I much prefer that art over the Resistance themed cards.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]The more I played the less interested I got in playing again. It also is an extremely cutthroat and confrontational game and that&#039;s not typically the kind of game my family enjoys. So finally after months of sitting on my shelf unplayed I decided to sell my copy. 

Since I have so many card games I love in our collection this isn&#039;t one I will miss, but if anyone ever wanted to play I would happily get trounced.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Awesome, confrontational 2p card game.
- This would make an excellent cafe game.
- Plays really quick (about 15 minutes per game).
- Excellent riff on trick taking, I love how there are only 3 cards with special abilities.
- Another game where you can play on your opponents side of the board (in their court).
- The tension is ratcheted up because it is very difficult to get a new card into the inner court in an empty space. You really need to protect some of those cards.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Condition: Excellent

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>[i]Lots of great memories from playing with my pepere and my dad. 
In my opinion the best 2 player card game you can play with a poker deck. 

Worst Cribbage moment: Playing with my dad I get dealt four 5&#039;s. Awesome, highest odds of getting 28, all I need is a 10 or face card. Didn&#039;t get one!

Best Cribbage moment: Fast forward a few years. Playing against my dad I get dealt three 5&#039;s and the queen of spades. The 5 of spades got cut! 28 points! (If I had the Jack instead of the Queen I would have scored 29.)

We both now have a framed picture with the cards and a photo of us holding the board; a great moment I got to share with my dad.[/i]

	<numplays>22</numplays>			<comment>Received in a math trade. (9/14/14)

[i]- I absolutely love the theme, this is what sold me on the game (that and the beautiful dice).
- Quick playtime, even with 4 players (30 - 45 minutes).
- Plays great at all player counts (2,3 and 4 players).
- It would be a bit tight, but I think this can be brought out at a cafe.
- Easy to teach/learn. You can really just start playing and teach as you go.
- Artist cards are quite valuable and I am surprised at how much they can be fought over.
- Love the idea of not only building your own installation but also being able to share in the building of the museum.
- A surprising amount of tension in the game, especially since any of the 3 installations can be built by anyone (once built a new one comes out).[/i]

[i]Includes the following promos:
- Additional Installation cards
- Museum expansion pack
- The Attic[/i]

Received in a math trade (5/20/14).

My thoughts:

[i]First I have to admit they I really do not like most deck builders and DC is no exception (Super Motherload is the one deck builder I like). The ruleset is simple which rule set leads to very straight forward play. Therefore I think it would serve as a great introduction to deck building especially for families, but personally I was extremely bored while playing.
Had to pay this again and all I can say is :gulp:[/i]

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Deep Sea Adventure[/COLOR] was sold via auction 11/5/15.

Initial thoughts and rating (6):

[i]- Can be taught in under a minute, plays quick.
- Small box packed with some nice components and is easy to travel with.
- Potentially a good, light weight family game depending on how random you like your games.

I definitely got caught up in the hype with this game and got a copy as soon as it was available in the BGG store. I thought this game would replace Diamant/Incan Gold in our collection, but so far I&#039;m less than impressed. I really don&#039;t care for the shared oxygen mechanic because all it takes is one player to completely screw everyone else over. I&#039;m also not a fan of the randomness found in the die rolling combined with the random points distribution on the treasure tiles. Also Diamant plays up to 8 and is still very fun, Deep Sea caps out at 6 and I really disliked the 5p game I took part in.

I would recommend TROLL over Deep Sea Adventures if you want to try a push your luck game published by Oink Games.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>[i]Really want to play, may replace Diamant in our collection.[/i]</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I played this with Mat and our sons and had fun.
Be warned this game is all about take that and can get a little mean.
I have been looking for a light dice filler so I was really excited to play this, but I thought it took too long for what it is.
There are not that many decisions to be made so playing this for 45 minutes gets a little repetitive.
This may seem like an odd comment but I also thought only rolling four dice not very fulfilling; I always felt like I was missing a die.

I am glad I was able to play this before I bought/traded for it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>I need to start by saying that I really enjoyed my play of Deus and look forward to playing again. It is an interesting take on tableau building; once a card is built in a certain color it will get activated every time a new card is built in that color. This really opens up the game play and strategies/tactics you can employ. You are trying to create an efficient tableau so that you can maximize each activation of your cards [i](they will only be activated 1 to 5 times during the game)[/i]. I also do not have a problem with the aesthetics of the game, I like the card art and wooden buildings and the tiles are fine. 
[i]The one concern I would have is playing it with more than 3, I have a feeling that the game would drag (similar to Imperial Settlers)[/i].

[i]*The question you may be asking is why did I remove it from my wishlist. It has nothing to do with the game itself, it is more a statement of where my collection is at the moment. I have a lot of games that while not exactly similar scratch the same itch as Deus [i]([thing=28143][/thing], [thing=154203][/thing], [thing=166669][/thing] and to a lesser degree [thing=164338][/thing])[/i]. Add to that the fact that one of my friends has a copy so I know I will get to play it.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]Originally owned Incan gold but the component quality was just okay. The card quality was not that good, and the fold up tents stunk. Also every game we played multiple people would get confused with the cards used to show whether you were leaving or staying. I ended up trading Incan Gold and got a copy of [thing=15512][/thing]. This has remained one of our go to push your luck games, especially when we have friends and family over.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating:

[i]- Fun, quick filler that plays up to 8. 
- This game is easy to teach/learn; we have brought this to family get togethers and had a lot of fun playing with our extended families. 
- This game can be an addictive push your luck game. 
- The components for Diamant are absolutely amazing (diamonds for the gems, cool boxes for the gems and little Indiana Jones meeples)[/i].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Amazing artwork and graphic design, I love the art deco style.
- A fresh take on the trick taking genre, if you don&#039;t follow the suit led you get to take the special action granted by the card you played.
- As the dealer you get to decide how many cards [i](1 to 3)[/i] to pass leading to some creative play since you don&#039;t always know what your final hand will look like.
- There is a lot of player interaction since you are constantly stealing diamonds from other players and then trying to vault them before the same happens to you.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[i]- I&#039;ve seen some debate on the topic, but I really enjoyed Discoveries with 2.
- The artwork is beautiful (and I really appreciate the fact that they are actual paintings and not digital artwork).
- The common die pool mechanic creates player interaction since grabbing someone else&#039;s dice can really help you out (unless they recall their dice before you use them).
- Excellent blend of dice manipulation, racing to score cards and collecting the American Indian cards.
- This game moves along because you only get to take one action on your turn (it can slow down a bit when someone is figuring out how to complete multiple cards).
- Discoveries has a nice progression arc to it, it does not suffer from the fits and starts of Lewis and Clark, and in my opinion is the far superior game.

I am looking forward to getting in more plays of this game and I think it will be a hit with my family. I&#039;m sure we will add a copy to our collection soon, especially since my kids are focusing on early US history this year and this would be a fun game to play when they need some downtime.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Received in a trade for Innovation (Iello version) 1/21/14.

My thoughts:

[i]Wow, I have been looking forward to trying this one and now that I have I am not impressed. I find it extremely dry and all about the mechanics. There is no theme at all, the cards simply state what the action is, no fluff or flavor at all. This game has made me appreciate Legendary and eminent domain even more. I am surprised at how much the lack of theme really bothers me with this game, but I am uninterested in playing again. 
My kids do not like it at all.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Received in a math trade (9/22/14).

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]This game lasted a year in our collection and we really enjoyed our 10 plays (in fact this is a game my dad played with us). I have to admit that after the last few plays we decided that we played the game out. Yes there is randomness in each game based on the card draw and tile selection/placement, but the game started to feel samey. We all new where the best spots on the board were and even throwing other players people into the volcano started to lose it&#039;s charm. All that said I would still recommend this game to other families, just go into knowing that it will likely have a limited number of plays in it for you but I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll enjoy the ride.

I also need to admit that I may have been hasty getting rid of Survive: Escape from Atlantis! which received twice as many plays as Pompeii before I traded it. Looking back Survive definitely had a lot more variety in the way the game played out. I would consider getting another copy since it was a game that we played a lot with our extended family (especially once we got the 5/6 player expansion.)[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Fun! Everyone loves throwing meeples into the volcanoes and blocking other peoples paths to safety with a well placed lava tile.
- Another great family game; easy to teach with nice components (especially the volcano).
- My dad has had fun playing this with my kids. He enjoys games like this and Survive: Escape from Atlantis!.
- I like how the people placement works when you are able to place out &quot;family&quot; members if there are already people in a building.
- Love the tile placement for the lava flow after the volcano erupts (the opposite of Survive where you are removing tiles).[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Received in a math trade (9/22/14).</wishlistcomment></item>

- A negotiation game with a one minute time limit! This game runs at a brisk pace and adds real tension to the negotiations.
- Great art, and I appreciate how the theme ties in with the mechanisms. 
[i]You are fighting dragons with different characters of varying strength and sometimes special abilities.[/i]
[i]- The magic object cards add some fun special powers into the game, at least for the person playing the card.[/i]
- I appreciate the fact that this game focuses solely on negotiation and nails it, there is zero bloat in this game. 
- All of the above points make this an excellent family game, my daughter loved it.

It is a quick playying card game that includes some dice rolling. You are trying to defeat monsters using sets of cards (&quot;x&quot; of a kind or straights of like color) which allow you to roll a certain number of dice. There were enough different elements to keep the game fresh, but I would only recommend it for people with younger kids (6 - 8) or for gamers looking for a very light filler with some clever card play and dice rolling.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]4[/COLOR]):

[i]I understand that this game could be engaging if you enjoy abstracts with a chess like feel, but it is far from the kind of game I enjoy playing. I am glad to have tried it, but it&#039;s not a game my family and I enjoyed.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (6):

[i]This game had been on my wishlist for a while and then it went oop. A few weeks ago I saw it a local FLGS so I picked it up having never played it before.
I was really excited to get it to the table, so my son and I stopped at a cafe on the way home to give it a few plays.

I found it to be somewhat boring and mediocre. I think I might be the problem though, because I don&#039;t really think I care for most abstract games, especially ones that feel like chess. The way the tiles move is really cool and the fact that they flip over and have different movement patterns on the back is interesting. However; the game just isn&#039;t that interesting. The game wants to be epic and exciting, but you are playing on a small grid where the movement always feels constrained.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Wow this game is heavy, there is a lot going on. [i](As a point of reference I think Agricola is easier to teach/learn/play.)[/i]
At first my son struggled, but as the game went on he started to get a handle on things.

Highlights:
- Love the artwork and theme... brilliant.
- The bidding mechanic that determines which workers get placed first.
- Puzzling out how to manage all of your monsters needs.
- A really weighty worker placement game with a great theme (although I still prefer Agricola).

[i]I really enjoyed my play of this and I would gladly play again. 
However; this is not a game I would ever own because my wife and older daughter would not like how much micro management there is in this game.

BTW: I have seen this game recommended as a family game and I strongly disagree. 
This game is heavy and unforgiving, do not let the theme fool you.[/i]</comment>				</item>

My thoughts:

[i]This was one of the first games I got to play with my kids. At the time we had played a lot of Forbidden Island, so I thought a dungeon crawl co-op sounded fun.
This game is easy to teach and definitely accessible to kids. My kids really enjoyed it for a while, this was a game they would play by themselves sometimes.

However; eventually our collection began to grow and this game just sat on our shelves in favor of other games.
I definitely think this game looses some of it&#039;s luster after multiple plays, the game play gets repetitive and stale.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Dynasties (now Sun Tzu)[/COLOR] was sold via auction 11/5/15.

My thoughts:

[i]I can see the merits of this game, but it was very dry. I&#039;ve been looking for a good 2p area control game, but unfortunately the search continues. I enjoyed it more than my son, in large part because he didn&#039;t engage in any kind of bluffing and just tried to bulldoze his way to victory. That lead to him receiving a very through beating. While I think the game offers some decent tactical depth, we were both bored while playing it. In the past we probably would give it a few more plays, but we have too many excellent 2p games that we enjoy playing much more. 

If you are looking for a 2p tactical game that offers a lot of back and forth and bluffing I can&#039;t recommend Battle Line enough. While technically not area control there is a push pull element to this game and you can go all out for a quick victory via a break through or take your time and win by capturing the majority of flags (5 of 9).[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>[i]After watching Marco&#039;s review I definitely want to find the Jolly Roger edition.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Eclipse[/COLOR] was sold via auction 4/20/15.
Received in a math trade (3/17/15).

My thoughts:

[i]This was a tough one to judge. I played a 2p game with my son and by the end the whole experience fell flat for us. There was very little tension since we could each explore our own part of the board. Then when there was finally some conflict I demolished a large portion of his fleet making it almost impossible for him to come back. The ancients in the base game are too weak to put up much of a challenge by the mid game. However, early game, my son got hosed because every tile he explored had ancient ones while I was getting tiles where I could place out my cubes unimpeded. 

All that said I loved the game and think it would shine with at least 4 players. I would love to play it again at that player count, but that isn&#039;t going to happen in my house so I decided to purge it. [/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]Definitely a game I need to play again to see how I really feel about it. I honestly don&#039;t understand how Egizia is often touted as the heavier version of Stone Age. I agree Egizia is heavier, but fail to see any other connection besides the fact that they are both WP games. To be honest I thought I would enjoy the game much more, but I am starting to realize that I&#039;m not as big a fan of games where you are searching for bonus cards to score (the major scoring opportunity in this game). I much prefer wp games like Targi, Agricola and Snowdonia where there is some resource conversion and all of the point scoring opportunities are known right from the beginning of the game.

I did enjoy the tension created by the wp mechanic; as you progress down the Nile you can never claim an action you already passed. Sometimes you really need to take a certain space, but how much are you willing to pass by to get there? Great mechanic in an otherwise standard game. 

I am sure part of my feelings toward this game come from the fact that I&#039;ve now played a lot of wp games and I&#039;ve figured out what kind of mechanics I&#039;m looking for in that type of game. Had I played this when I first got in the hobby I would have enjoyed it much more. As it is I&#039;d probably rather lay Stone Age at this point. I&#039;m glad I got to play and I would definitely enjoy playing again, but it is no longer a game that I want to add to our collection.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I found this to be a very bland area control game.
Two things probably doomed this game from the start, I played El Grande around the same time and I only played two player.
I could see this game being better with more, but not that much better.
Everything about the game is bland and boring and the set collection really doesn&#039;t fit in with area control.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Another co-op game that fell completely flat for me. Part of it may be due to how the game played out. We got the crap beaten out of us, but once the great one came out we handily defeated it [i](which felt very anti-climactic)[/i]. The Cthulhu Mythos isn&#039;t necessarily my thing, it&#039;s approaching zombie status as far as pop culture over saturation. 

There is not much else to say, the game play was kind of blah. Basically you are rolling dice yahtzee style to fill orders on a card [i](room)[/i]. Succeed and get a reward, fail and bad things happen. I can also see how this game could easily outstay it&#039;s welcome because the game play is so basic. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Received in a math trade. (10/5/15)

- Different take on a tableau builder because cards are activated if they are in your Domain, but will only score you end game points if they are moved to your Elysium.
- You can drastically change the way the game plays out based on which of the decks you use.
- The Apollo deck is a must play, it introduces the oracle which allows you to see upcoming cards for future rounds.
- The artwork is excellent, I appreciate the decision to have different artists illustrate each separate deck.
- The last round can go a bit long because you need to make sure you get everything done before the game ends. 
- Similar to other tableau builders there are a lot of card abilities you need to pay attention to. 
My ease of play list for tableau builders which goes from virtually no upkeep to almost too much: Race for the Galaxy -&gt; Deus -&gt; Elysium -&gt; Imperial Settlers.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>25</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Eminent Domain[/COLOR] was traded away in a math trade 3/12/14. (Received Thebes: The Tomb Raiders)

My toughts:

[i]This an odd one, this was a game we got early on and played it quite a bit. Then we got [thing=28143][/thing] which killed this game, causing Eminent Domain to become a victim of the Jones Theory.

Fast forward to earlier this month and I picked up a copy with the expansion thinking this would add something more to the game. It really hasn&#039;t, the new research cards are okay, but they just don&#039;t add enough to make this game exciting.

In RFtG you feel the tension of the dwindling amount of turns you have left; Eminent feels more like a crawl with a very abrupt end. In the end this is just not my cup of tea, and as you will notice later on I really don&#039;t care for deck building games at all. (The one exception is Super Motherload)[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]- Amazing family game that you can play with young children. 
[i]My youngest daughter was almost 4 when she started playing.[/i]
- The components are top notch: the wooden prince and sorcerer and a cute plastic princess with a crown. 
- Beautiful game board.
- The tower: The princess &quot;jumps&quot; out when you select the right slot to put the key in.
- The prince can be played by a few people to help the younger ones remember where you have looked.
- Nice variation on roll and move which involves 2 dice, one for movement and one for which player moves first.
- I could see us playing this with only adults for some light hearted fun.

This game will never leave our collection, I hope to play it with my grandchildren some day![/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR])

[i]This game fell quickly; my kids found this game really stressful and never requested to play it. Also, after 15 plays, I feel like we saw everything it had to offer and adding expansions wasn&#039;t really going to change much. This is another co-op game that has fizzled out with my family, therefore I traded it away.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8.5):

[i]- Great soundtrack, really sets the mood for this game.
- The theme comes through; you feel like you are trapped in some horrible temple with little time to escape.
- Nice artwork and components, I really like the Indiana Jones meeples.
- Plays in 10 minutes making this a great beginning/end of night game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]This was high on my want to play list, so I was happy when Drew offered to bring it to a meet up. My first play included the flight expansion, which in hindsight adds some much needed variety to the game play. After 3 plays I&#039;m already finding the game to be severely limited in the amount of variety the evolution cards offer. 

In my opinion Evolution occupies the same game space as tableau builders like Race and Roll for the Galaxy, Elysium, Imperial Settlers and Deus yet is severely limited by a small set of species abilities. I understand that the combination of these abilities can change how the different species interact, but there are still only a handful of different ways to evolve your species. Also it is extremely hard to play a carnivore which my kids found really frustrating (even though they were eating me, it was only small bites so I was still raking in the points).. I was able to win 2 of the games I played while completely ignoring the carnivore strategy while my opponents were busy eating my dinosaurs, but unable to consume the same amount of food I was.

I think Evolution is a solid game and if asked I would play it again, but even with the Flight expansion this still isn&#039;t a game I want to own.[/i]

I only played once, but that&#039;s all it took to figure out that this is an awesome dice filler. I can&#039;t help but compare Excape to Can&#039;t Stop because they are both pure push your luck games that deal with probability.

I actually really enjoy both games a lot, with one exception for Can&#039;t Stop that Excape solves... play time. Can&#039;t Stop with 3 and especially 4 tends to overstay its welcome. There are always edge of your seat moments, but the game drags on too long for what it offers. Excape fixes that, that game plays out at a very quick pace and you aren&#039;t constantly moving pieces on a board.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>[i]Unfortunately OOP and expensive, maybe some day.[/i]</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I will start by saying this is an absolutely beautiful game, they did an excellent job choosing artwork that has a whimsical, folk tale feel to it.
I was happy to finally try the game, although at this point I have come to realize that I really don&#039;t care for the deck building mechanic.
As much as I wanted to love the game (I thought it would be a great gift for my older daughter) it fell flat.
I played a 2p game and it lasted over an hour and there really weren&#039;t many decisions to be made; the meaningful decisions were few an far between.

[i]All that said I think Fantastiqa is a great intro into deck building, especially for a family.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Initial thoughts and rating:

[i]- A wide open Uwe game that still leaves you feeling that you could have accomplished more and been more efficient.
- A staggering amount of ways to build your engine/score points and they each feel unique.
- Surprisingly easy to get into even though there are so many paths open to you in the beginning of the game, it opens up quite naturally and thematically makes sense.
- I really appreciate the autobiographical perspective this game offers. I always enjoy playing games that have ties to history, even if it is a personal view of of a time/place (this feels like one of Uwe&#039;s more thematic games).
- Typical amazing Lookout bits/production, with beautiful artwork by Dennis Lohausen. 
- As much as I have enjoyed my initial plays of FoA it still doesn&#039;t come close to surpassing Agricola for me.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]10[/COLOR]):

[i]Thankfully I grabbed a copy on the marketplace before prices began to skyrocket. This game continues to see consistent play, especially as a 2p game with my wife. We both love this game, it plays fast and when we play it is a very relaxed gaming experience. To this day I still can not recommend it highly enough. As far as my kids, my son really doesn&#039;t like it much anymore since we have so many other games to choose from now.

My older daughter on the other hand still enjoys playing, although she to usually will pick another game to play.
Hopefully this game will see a reprint, it is a great gateway/family/2 player game![/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (9):

[i]- Excellent gateway/family game, simple rules and easy to teach.
- Plays well at all player counts, especially with 2.
- Very strategic in the 2p game because you can plan ahead when it comes to your movement on the rondel.
- High replay value due to the random order tile, bonus tile and rondel set up.
- Beautiful board, and amazing fruit meeples.
- This is one of the most relaxing games to play that I have in my collection.
- The perfect chill with a :tankard: board game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Initial thoughts and rating (10):

[i]I love what this adds to the game play, the extra action tile is great (it allows you to move an opponents pawn and collect fruit/donkeys with it). The wild windmill tile can make it easier to get a fruit that you&#039;ve had a hard time acquiring. My favorite part is probably the farmer, I took advantage of him multiple times [he allows you to pay in any fruit on a tile as long as the quantities match, i.e. 2 of one and 3 of another).[/i] I do question whether we played the drought tiles right, it seems like a free 2 points are available if they happen to be face up when you sell fruit. Maybe it would entice you to sell a smaller lot of fruit. 

Overall I&#039;d highly recommend picking this up if you own Finca which really deserves a reprint). You can still order the Spiel magazine that includes this promo direct from their website. I also ended up getting all the Castles of Burgundy promos as well. [/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]This is a tough one. I really enjoyed playing this game, but unfortunately my family did not (they found it boring). Firenze has a very clean and streamlined rule set that offers a lot of variety in the tactics you employ to play the game. There is nothing fiddly about this game.

I really enjoyed the tension created by having to manage only one resource in the game (the tower pieces are also your currency). The cards really give this games some legs and help increase player interaction. I also appreciate how the cards also function as a market of sorts were the new tower pieces are placed. It creates some great moments where you only want/need the card or tower pieces but you are forced to take either a card or building pieces you don&#039;t want. 

This is another great family game that I would probably recommend, but the theme is very dry and for my family the game play got repetitive after a few plays. I also don&#039;t think that this game plays well with 2, most of the tension is lost and each player ends up doing their own thing. It also didn&#039;t help that I got The Palaces of Carrara around the same time and that has been a hit with my family, especially my wife, and it plays great with 2.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Plays good with 2, but better with more.
- This game is a bit simpler than Palaces of Carrara which means that my kids feel more confident when playing this game.
- The building blocks are also the currency for the game used when purchasing a card farther down the track.
- The addition of the cards introduces some more strategy into the game because not only do you get the card effect (good or bad) but you also get whatever blocks are stacked on that card.
- This game is very easy to teach[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition, only played a few times.

I have played twice and had fun, but both games I played went on too long due to some players having some serious AP.

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]Another COOP that started with a bang and then fizzled out. The other two plays came in May 2014 (one month after we got it)  and then just sat on the shelf. I finally decided to get rid of a few weeks ago to make some room on our game shelves.

Flash Point is a good family game, but COOP&#039;s continue to not get played in my house (well except for Pandemic: Legacy).[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]First I need to say that I am not a huge fan of Coops, but I wanted to try to find one that was thematic and that I could enjoy playing with my family. Long story short, Flash Point fills that niche in our collection.

Highlights:
- Awesome theme that is well integrated into the game mechanics.
- Great family game and since it is a coop you can potentially play with younger kids.
- Great bits that enhance the game.
- You actually feel the tension ratchet up as a house fills with smoke and fire.
- The group of characters you can play are all interesting and affect the game in different ways. Sometimes it does make sense to change the character you are playing as.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Condition: Excellent, components are all bagged.

[i]- Really nice artwork and components. The card quality is outstanding.
- Employs one of my favorite mechanics, using cards for multiple purposes.
- The auctions add something new to this type of game [i](I am comparing it to a game like [thing=28143]Race[/thing]).[/i]
- Played well with two using the captains from Arctic Bounty.
- Fairly straight forward game to learn/teach, could definitely be a family game in my house.
- Plays quick, almost too quickly, but I am not sure about this yet. It may have been the result of using the salty captain cards.

I thought the 2p experience was good, but I think it would be much better with more players. That is the sticking point for me, I know my son would dig it but not sure about my daughter and wife. In my opinion you still can&#039;t beat 2p [thing=28143]Race[/thing] when it comes to this type of game. 
However; I really enjoyed the auction mechanic.

Quick update: my daughter loves it![/i]</comment>				</item>

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]I was really excited to get this one since Fleet is one of my favorite games, but it doesn&#039;t hit the table as much as I&#039;d like )in part because you need more than 2 players for the game to shine). I was hoping to find another game in the Fleet universe that would be a bit easier to set up and play. After a couple of plays I can happily say Fleet Wharfside has delivered. 

- Plays up to 4, but is still an excellent 2p game that will make a great cafe/pub game.
- While it uses the Fleet theme (and great artwork) the game play is different and timing becomes very important.
- Contract cards are now scored via a set collection mechanic, but until you score them they will give you a special ability to use.
- Buying contracts and buildings (which are worth straight VP in Wharfside) involves collecting a certain type/quantity of cards, but the market changes every time a card is purchased.
- There is a hierarchy to the fish (think poker hands) so you can always substitute a higher ranking set of fish to buy a contract.
- King crab are played to your tableau for VP, but they are also the highest ranking fish when it comes time to buy contracts. [/i]</comment>				</item>

- Easy to teach, you can teach as you play (only explaining one phase at a time).
- I can see this becoming a staple when beginning or ending a game night.
- A great family game that can be a great first step in learning bidding/auction games.
- Awesome week night filler, we can get a 4p game in under 20 minutes.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>- Another fun, family co-op designed by Matt Leacock (Forbidden Island/Pandemic) with typical top notch art and components. 
- Happy to find out that it plays much differently than Forbidden Island and is a definite step up in difficulty (this game can be brutal). 
- The sand building up on the board is really helps immerse you in the theme and helps build tension. 
- A few role repeats and some brand new ones; what&#039;s cool is the old roles still feel fresh because of how differently this game plays out and the interactions with the new roles. 
- I enjoy having to find the pieces by uncovering the two tiles and finding where they intersect to unearth the treasure. 
- Quick playtime, Forbidden Desert is another game we can easily bust out on a night when we don&#039;t have a lot of time to play a game. It also helps that it&#039;s a co-op so there won&#039;t be hurt feelings when playing with tired kids who are begging me to play a game :)

Our first designer board game, this is the game that got my family and I into this hobby.
This game helped teach my kids how to cooperate when playing games and not to take gaming too seriously. It also helped my kids to learn to lose gracefully, especially since we all lost!

Highlights:
- Great gateway game for families, easy to learn.
- Beautiful components and great artwork on the tiles.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]I still really like this game, and would be willing to play anytime but my family did not care for it.
We also have a lot of worker placement games and this one wasn&#039;t seeing any play time so it got traded.
I still maintain this is an excellent family game, but for us it fell victim to the Jones theory.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Theme: I am an artist and art teacher so I love the theme of painting a Fresco, especially the color mixing mechanic.
- As always beautiful production quality from Queen games.
- Love the happiness rating which goes up or down based on how early/late you get up.
- My family loves worker placement games (I know this is more a simultaneous action selection game but to my family it is WP).

This is another great family game put out by Queen games. (We also own and enjoy Escape: The Curse of the Temple and Via Appia.) My older daughter is 8 and she has no trouble playing this game well.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This was the first trick taker of the night Mat introduced me to during our gaming meet up. Perfect game for Halloween Eve, we played the Poison version which had some cool cauldrons to play your cards on.

This one reminded me a bit of [thing=56692][/thing] since you didn&#039;t score points if you had the most of a color. 
As a plus I think this would be a great introduction into trick taking games for kids because the game play is so straight forward.</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR])

[i]I realized recently that the expansion killed this game for me. It added way to many rules/mechanics with very little pay out. I actually enjoyed the base game and I am now looking for a copy (mostly because my son loves this game).[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (7.5):

[i]First couple of games were shaky, lots of rules to remember. I thought this was going to end up being a poor purchase decision, but even though my kids ships are getting trashed they still want to play. Also this has been the worst game, by far, to punch out all the cardboard chits. Even when using a razor blade I still had a few pieces tear.

I think this is a fun family game, my kids really enjoy playing. They love building things (hence our huge collection of legos) and this game offers them a chance to do that. My daughter Madeline (who just turned 8) can hold her own. Her ships are not always as well built, but she has won because she always builds ships with tons of storage. They both handle it well when parts of their ship are destroyed, we usually have a good laugh. I would recommend this as a good family game, especially if your kids love to build things.[/i]

My thoughts:

[i]I have come to realize that this expansion made me really dislike Galaxy Trucker. Just figuring out he movement of the intruders on your ship is enough to drive you crazy. Also added too many additional parts to build your ship. I like the new ship components. The level 4 ships are cool, but a flight with them takes an hour. The new predators and commandos sound cool, but figuring out their movement path is a game in and of itself... highly frustrating. This adds length to a game I already find too long for what it is.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>[i]- The theme and artwork are beautiful, love the aesthetic of the flower bed drawings [i](they look like 1950&#039;s floral fabric patterns)[/i].
- The biggest surprise for me is how well it plays with 2*, which has become my preferred player count.
- I don&#039;t know how the designer figured it all out, but the placement of the 4 colors on each tile is always less than ideal. When playing a 2p game you are almost always giving your opponent a leg up in another flower bed when placing tiles.
- It takes a lot of planning and a bit of luck, but you can finish multiple flower beds on one turn which is extremely satisfying. 
- The tie breaker is perfect and since the scores are fixed [i](you can score a maximum of 10/8 points)[/i] this could have easily made the conclusion of the game anticlimactic. 
  [i]Tie breaker rule - you have to count how many sections of each flower bed are match the color of the flower bed tile you place. This adds to the strategy because you are constantly trying to complete flower beds with a 2 color majority. [/i]

*I wasn&#039;t going to get the game once I read the 2p rules because it sounded like it wouldn&#039;t be as streamlined to play since both players control 2 colors. However; what I found was that the 2p game is actually the most tactical game, where you can really plan your future moves since only one other person is placing a tile between your turns.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Ginkgopolis[/COLOR] was sold via auction 7/10/15.

My thoughts:

[i]- I love the area control aspect of the game, there is a lot of direct interaction as the board state constantly changes.
- The city building enhances the player interaction. You can either increase the size of the city or make existing buildings taller (which gives you the opportunity to take control of another players building). 
- The whole time you are doing this you also have to manage your resources and tiles (the buildings you can place) which is tense and fun.

So far I am enamored with the game, then it comes time to score and things start falling apart.I really dislike the scoring in this game. Maybe I am stuck on the elegant simplicity of the scoring system of El Grande, which may not be a valid comparison to some, but hear me out. You spend the whole game fighting for control of districts so you can score the most points, but then you also have to take into account the cards you will score as well.

Here is my problem, you can certainly try and plan which cards you may get to score but this could lead you to ignore building towards majorities in certain districts. Some may find managing these opposing scoring mechanisms tense and exciting; I find it frustrating and chaotic. I don&#039;t think the two different ways you score blend together at all, there is very little synergy (if any) between the points cards will give you and gaining majorities in districts.

In the end, I love the game play but hate the scoring. I know that I could eventually learn which cards score what, but I am not interested. I wish the scoring was strictly based on area control and didn&#039;t involve all of these other seemingly arbitrary scoring cards.[/i]</comment>				</item>

- Quick playtime: 20 minutes per player is accurate.
- Resource management including how the production wheels work when producing bricks and glass.
- Card play: having to chooses which workers you want to use while also trying to figure out which ones your opponents may want to use (this reminds me a bit of RFtG).
- The buildings that are available from game to game really change your strategy, and make this a game with a lot of replay value.
- Great production quality, love the eater eggs found in the artwork on some of the tiles.

This may not be Uwe Rosenberg&#039;s best game design, but it is probably my favorite.
A big part of this is the combination of short play time and this is a game my wife has recently been requesting to play.
She does not usually like games with lots of moving parts, but after a couple of plays this game has clicked with her.
Glass Road is a game that will see consistent play for a long time.[/i]

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Loved this game, which isn&#039;t really a surprise since I have loved every game where cards are used for multiple purposes (RFtG and Bruges).
I could imagine playing this over and over again, constantly trying new strategies to win the game.

The only problem is finding a copy that doesn&#039;t cost an arm and a leg.
I have decided to hold out and play Impulse before deciding to plop down the money to get a copy of GTR. (Unfortunately Impulse didn&#039;t cut it.)</comment>				</item>

[i]Special thanks to [user=eekamouse]Joel Eddy[/user] for bringing this game to my attention during his top 10 games of 2014 video.

- I love the art and aesthetics of this game. It is a very clean/slick presentation with very clear iconography.
- This is the perfect Euro style civ building game, the rule set is quite intuitive and easy to learn.
- Perfect blend of in game and end game scoring, you are never quite sure how you are doing in the game [i](mostly due to your personal end game goal and the military vp)[/i].
- The tech tree might appear slightly generic, but wow does it offer tons of different strategies to explore. 
- Leaders, they all offer different perks and you get to choose whether or not you want to upgrade your leader each age.
- Declaring a Golden Age will net you 2 gold for every turn other players take after you, which really forces you to play as efficiently as possible (having gold in this game is very important because you pay to unlock techs and attack other players)[/i].</comment>				</item>

[i]- Elegant! This game has such a simple rule set, yet there is so much depth and strategy to explore.
- Plays great with 3, 4 and 5.
- A lot of player interaction, this is not multiplayer solitaire.
- My favorite mechanic is secretly selecting a territory to place/move guys using the dial, there are a lot of memorable moments created because of this (Especially when it comes to the Castillo).
- Great family game, my 9 year old daughter has picked up this game quickly because the rules are so simple.
- For a 20 year old game it still looks good, especially the Castillo.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]This was another game I really enjoyed playing that fell flat with my family (mostly my kids). I really thought the gravity mechanic worked well and there was just enough chaos in the game. I always enjoyed seeing my &quot;brilliant&quot; plan foiled by someone playing a card I didn&#039;t expect. I also thought the few card types that either pulled ships toward you or pushed you away from the gravitational pull worked well in mixing up the game play and adding an element of unknown to your play.[/i] 

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Great, light family game (my 2 older kids had no problem figuring out the game after 1 play).
- Interesting twist on racing since your movement is tied to the gravity of surrounding ships and how close you are to them.
- The drafting mechanic that begins each round when you choose one face up card and one face down card.
- Plays well with 2, 3 and 4 players.
- Quick: great week night game (plays in 20 - 30 minutes).
- The colors used on the board/ cards.
- My wife enjoys it and has a knack for playing this game well.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]This is a tough one for me to decide on. I thought I had found a small footprint and quick playing pick up and deliver game. We had tried Perry Rhodan and thought it was okay, then I played Great Heartland and really enjoyed it. Once it was reprinted I picked up a copy and I got it to the table a few times with my gaming group and a few times with my son. 

In the end I think it is an okay game, but I think it outstays its welcome. By the end I really just want the game to end, but you end up scratching and clawing your way to the finish and it feels quite anticlimactic because the winner has always been decided a few turns before the game actually ends.

I would play it again if asked, but in the end it didn&#039;t deliver. I&#039;m still looking for a quick, small footprint PU&amp;D game but haven&#039;t found it yet (both Perry Rhodan and Akrotiri also fell short).[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- An excellent pick up and deliver game that plays in about a 1/2 hour.
- Plays great with 2.
- Small footprint, would make an excellent cafe game.
- Plenty of meaty decisions to be made, feels like a full sized pick up and deliver game packed into a card game.
- You need to plan good routes since you can only pick up or deliver on each turn, and you have to move each turn.
- Great use of cards to create 2 currencies you need to manage (gas for movement and goods to pick up/sell goods).
- Variant map layouts depending on the number of players that really change how the game plays out.

This is exactly the quick playing pick up and deliver game I was looking for (Perry Rhodan: The Cosmic League didn&#039;t cut it).[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition, only played a few times.

	<numplays>34</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Plays great with 2.
- Another great cafe game, as long as you put it into a smaller box.
- An interesting take on set collection, each card type has special abilities dependent upon how many have already been played in your guild hall.
- There is a surprising amount of depth (I feel like I am still scratching at the surface) for a game that only has 6/12 different card types.
- Quick playtime, about a 1/2 hour for a 2p game.

Quick update: 
I do not enjoy this game with 4, it drags on for way too long. I will only play his game with 2 or 3 from now on.[/i]

My thoughts:

[i]Has since been replaced by Parade and Diamonds, which are 2 other card games my dad and son would rather play.

I have been playing Cribbage for over 25 years, mostly with my dad. We have played countless games of Cribbage, so when I found out about Haggis I was intrigued, but I knew my dad was my most likely opponent. The question was would my dad forgo a game of Cribbage to play Haggis?

The short answer is yes. We are still in the early stages of unwrapping the layers of strategy found in this game, and we are really enjoying this game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

We thought we were going to score a perfect round until we realized that the game is scored once the last card is drawn.
I have to admit that even though I don&#039;t really like co-ops I really enjoyed my one play of this.
I could see playing this a bunch of times in a row, getting really good at it and then giving it away to someone else so they can solve the puzzle.

My thoughts:

[i]This is only the second game I kickstarted and wow am I disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much from this game, but it is very light and too streamlined. Your choices each turn are not very interesting, manipulating the market isn&#039;t all that exciting and that is basically the whole game. This is not the quick playing/ lighter version of Le Havre that some people are comparing it too. The decision space is just too limited. Even the building bonuses [i](each card has one of four symbols that give you a bonus)[/i] are really blah. 

I am personally even more disappointed because I love the artwork/theme so much. A definite miss for me and not a game I am willing to play again.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Condition: Excellent

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR])

[i]I still actually really like Le Havre, but it was extremely difficult to get to the table and I got offered a great trade. The play time and table space was a major factor in how few times Le Havre got played. I only mention this because I think Le Havre is an excellent design by Uwe, but I like some of his other games more (Agricola, At the Gates of Loyang and Glass Road) and they all play much quicker (usually an hour or less if it&#039;s a 2p game).

Since I am not a collector I don&#039;t feel the need to own every game created by one of my favorite designers so Le Havre left my collection. There wasn&#039;t ever a time that I would choose Le Havre over one of the other Uwe games I own. All that said I&#039;d happily play this again, I still think it&#039;s a very good game.[/i] 

Initial thoughts and rating (9):

- Variability among the buildings which leads to multiple strategies you can pursue.
- Resource conversion: I know this may seem like work to some, but I love this in games (Glass Road is another favorite of mine).
- I really like the artwork and the components are top notch.
- Plays really well with 2.[/i]

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR])

[i]Initially my kids and I really enjoyed this game, but the lack of any variability to the set up killed it for me. There are different pathes you can take, but each game you define your approach and then execute it without much variance or opposition.

I ended up trading it because we have so many other Uwe games that are awesome with 2 and play fast (Agricola, Agricola All Creatures, Glass Road, Loyang and Patchwork spring to mind).[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- A really thinky game that plays in about a 1/2 hour.
- Mechanics: I love figuring out how to use the building in order to maximize the amount of each good I have in my warehouse.
- Building variety: There are 30 buildings in the game and you can&#039;t maximize each resource so you have to figure out what your scoring focus is going to be. Of course your opponent can then take a building you really wanted, but you can pay them to use that building. 
- I love using the player board/wheel to keep track of how many times you can use buildings (you can see how he further developed this idea for the resource wheels in Glass Road).[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]I played once with my family and we all would rather play For Sale so I ended up trading this one away. Personally I enjoyed the added mechanic of having to manage your money (if you spend the most, you can&#039;t win), but when playing with family it just makes the game a bit more convoluted. I would play it again, but definitely not something I&#039;d seek out to play.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Quick play time, great filler.
- Limited amount of money of specific values, which can cause you to overpay for a specific tile.
- Tension because of the end game condition: the person with the least amount of money is eliminated from the game before scoring your tiles.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition, only played a few times.

My thoughts:

[i]This game held a lot of promise, mostly because I love the idea of deck building but hate shuffling cards continuously so the idea of substituting cubes for cards sounded awesome. Unfortunately the game failed to deliver for both my kids and I. 

First turns in this game can be quite slow and prone to AP as you try and plan ahead future turns to make sure you maximize your possible actions without having to reset before getting to pull off the move you want to make. This leads to my next problem, the turns that move quickly for you are usually quite anti-climactic since you didn&#039;t get the cards you needed. 

I also found the overall aesthetics of the game to be all over the place, the minis were okay, I really liked the card art, but the tiles were ugly and the graphic design was terrible the symbols they use are counter intuitive. 

I still think the bag building concept is pretty cool, but unfortunately Hyperborea doesn&#039;t deliver. In the end the theme is wasted and the game ends up being disjointed collection of mechanisms and concepts that don&#039;t gel together to offer a smooth game play experience.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>[i]I&#039;d like to try out a bag builder and this would be the easiest sell with my family (I already know my son&#039;s interested).[/i]</wishlistcomment></item>

- Plays great with 2, which means it will see lots of play in my house.
- Hits the same sweet spot as RFtG while adding some different mechanics.
- Cards can be used for multiple purposes, except it will cost you different resources it is not as simple as just discarding a card for a specific effect.
- Multiple factions to play, each with very different strategies/play styles.[/i]</comment>				</item>

My thoughts:

[i]This is a tough one for me because I love the way the Atlanteans faction change the way you play the game. You will not score any points for the Atlantean buildings you construct because they all sink to the bottom of the ocean at the end of the game. The new technology tokens offer all kinds of ways to score extra vp with your common buildings and also help you get extra resources or take extra actions.

I actually really like the new Atlantean common buildings, they offer some new ways to get points, cards and resources and give the other factions even more reasons to collect technology tokens.

Now the not so good news (for me at least):

- Don&#039;t play the &quot;peaceful variant&quot; using the Atlantean cards, you need to be able to destroy the Atlantean common buildings or they will run rampant over you.
- Now there is even more information to keep track of on a turn by turn basis. It is really easy to forget to takes bonus points throughout the game because there are so many cards laid out in front of you. With all the additional cards from the expansion(s) there are more and more powers/abilities to manage.
- Games definitely run longer when playing with the expansion(s), our 2p games take 90 minutes now.

I still really enjoy playing Imperial Settlers, but all of the overhead you need to track during the game is a bit much. I actually find myself wanting to get Deus to the table more because there is a lot less info to track. And by far my favorite tableau builder is Race for the Galaxy which manages to have deep, strategic game play with minimal turn to turn upkeep. I&#039;m interested to see if my plays of Imperial Settlers dip over the next year or if I&#039;m just being cranky right now.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]4[/COLOR])

[i]I really didn&#039;t enjoy my initial plays so the game left our collection. I have zero desire to play this one again. I&#039;ve played almost all of Carl&#039;s games (except Mottainai) and Glory to Rome is by far my favorite (and the only one I can&#039;t find a copy of). Every time someone mentions one of his new games it&#039;s a reworking of GtR, yet none of them come close to surpassing that game for me.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (6):

[i]In a nut shell I was hoping that this game would scratch the same itch as Glory to Rome and unfortunately it does not. Unlike GtR and RFtG I find the race in this game to be unsatisfying and over too quick. The actions feel bland and mechanical, the theme does not come through at all (and I love sci-fi/ space themes). On top of all of that the artwork and graphic design are quite unappealing to me.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Joel had told me that this was a really fun game that blows Tsuro out of the water [i](I&#039;ve never played Tsuro)[/i].
So when the opportunity arose he taught my son and I.
I have to admit that I was surprised at how much I liked this game.

Highlights:
- Excellent gateway/family game.
- Absolutely beautiful board and tiles. I love the artwork.
- There is a good amount of player interaction to be found, especially since you share some of the &quot;goals&quot; where you score points.
- Simple mechanics, but enough strategy to keep you engaged. It may seem like you don&#039;t have a lot of choice, but as the board fills up if you plan well you can score lots of gems.
- Great tile laying game that feels different from games like Carcassonne and Alhambra (which are games I enjoy).
- Sliding the gems along the path is one of those zen moments in gaming, at least for me (simple things, simple minds...:D)

[i]I am glad Joel taught this game to me, it is now on my wishlist.
I think my wife would really enjoy this one.[/i]</comment>				</item>

First of all this is a great group for these kinds of games since we tend to be a bit raucous.
I think this game depends on having the right group dynamic, I could see it becoming very dry and procedural if played with the wrong group.

[i]All that said I would enjoy playing it again, especially since it plays so fast, but it is not necessarily a game that I feel the need to own. Partly because someone in our group has it and I think the more players the better, I would not want to play this with less than 5 or 6.[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]I have owned both the Iello and Asmadi version of this game and have traded them both away. (I prefer the graphic design and simplicity of the Asmadi version, I hated the art in the Iello version). I&#039;ve come to realize that Chudyk games aren&#039;t for me (except GtR) because of the high chaos factor and all of the info you need to keep tracking while playing.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Plays well with 2.
- There are a lot of cards in this game which leads to an unbelievable amount of potential interactions between cards.
- The Fission card: Wow; this went off in one of our games and it was crazy, it basically resets the game and destroys everything you have done.
- However; I find the game a bit too random and swingy.
- You don&#039;t always feel like it was your skill that caused you to win; instead you got lucky with a few card draws.
- I also found that the game usually ends way before you get to the higher ages (8 - 10) which means you very rarely see very many of those cards.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition, this was only played a few times (most of my plays were the Iello version).

I really enjoyed the area control aspect of the game that comes into play when you are trying to get cards from the center row. I also appreciated how dice were used in this game, basically the numbers on the dice tell you which cards you can try to gain control of by placing influence discs or you could take that many influence discs from the supply. You also have re-roll tokens that you can get back, but at the cost of points. 

[i]This is a great 2p game that I would be happy to own, but I have so many new 2p games that I am holding off for a while. I would be happy to play it again.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Enjoyed my play, hated the discs used in the game.

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Great family game with an awesome theme and a quick playtime.
- Plays great with 2 [i](we had quite a bit of interaction in our game)[/i].
- Interesting blend of mechanics that really work well as a whole.
- Art and components, specifically the artwork for the animals really stands out and the plastic scientists are a nice touch.
- Tough decisions when choosing cards since the can be used for multiple purposes.
- Combo building a nice set of powers to use during your turn, but because you can only have 3 powers active at once you constantly have to retool your strategy.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I was very excited to get to play this game and I was not disappointed. I had a blast trying to optimize my movement in order to eventually collect rubies.
I really like the twist put on the pick up and deliver mechanic (you have helper tokens stacked under you that get dropped off and picked up from spaces as you move around the board). 
I think having a variable set up for this game will definitely increase the replay value of this title. The production quality is high, and it has nice artwork.
I also think this could be an excellent advanced family game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Jaipur[/COLOR] was traded away for Akrotiri 12/15/14.

My thoughts:

- Quick 2p game that is easy to teach, making it a great gateway game.
- One my whole family can play and enjoy, my daughter was 6 when she started playing this one.
- Great cafe game, very small footprint on a table.
- The camel cards; I really enjoy playing set collection games that introduce some kind of new element to uncover. The camels really take this game from mediocre to good because there is always a risk when choosing camels, but they will give you a lot of flexibility during future turns.

[i]I still think this is a good game, but was traded because it fell victim to the Jones Theory in favor of [thing=122298][/thing].[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]4[/COLOR]):

[i]Wow, what a bummer this game was, I really don&#039;t get the hype that surrounded this game. Note to self... don&#039;t believe the hype surrounding OOP games! (I find it quite interesting that now that the game has been reprinted all the hype has dissipated and I don&#039;t hear anyone talking about this game). My family and I were bored playing this game, the decisions are very basic and straight forward. 

While this should be a great gateway game, it plays way to long for the amount of depth it has and is not a game I want to play again.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (7):

[i]First I need to mention that the production quality is top notch with great artwork. We all had fun playing, but I have to admit that due to all the hype surrounding it I was a bit underwhelmed. I can&#039;t put my finger on it maybe I was just expecting more from the game. It is a very simple game to play and teach and there are decisions to be made, but they do not require deep thought.[/i]

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]Since we have limited space for games, I gave this to a friend because I knew it would see limited play with all the other 2p games we have. I prefer playing Arboretum, Battle Line, Morels or Musee with my wife. 

I am still considering picking up a copy of Asante (which streamlined a few rules, especially no longer having to pay gold to use the sixth space in your market stall).[/i] 

Initial thoughts and rating (9):

- My wife enjoys it, we have already played 5 times since receiving it in a trade.
- I love the combination of set collection and buying/selling goods to make a profit.
- The different cards really add a lot of depth to what essentially is a set collection game.

I am always on the lookout for a quick playing game to play with my wife, and Jambo has been a hit. This also is a great game to play with older kids (8+ give or take).
It is too bad that this game is now OOP, but Asante seems to be the spiritual successor to Jambo. In fact you can combine the Asante cards with the Jambo cards.</comment>	<conditiontext>New in shrink.

[i]I knew going in that this would be a long shot, but I didn&#039;t have to break the bank to get a copy so I decided to take a flyer on it hoping it would be a good 2p area control game. Unfortunately it wasn&#039;t my cup of tea, I should&#039;ve listened to Marc (hawk-x-).

I didn&#039;t maind the interaction (El Grande is a favorite of mine) what I couldn&#039;t handle was the non existent theme pasted over an Abstract game. In my opinion it didn&#039;t feel like an area control game at all. Still I&#039;m not sorry that I tried Kahuna, if nothing else it made me realize that looking for a 2p area control game is a fools errand. Area control games require more than 2 players to achieve the type of interaction I look for when playing this type of game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]I traded this game because it is such a bear to set up and teach, but I would play it anytime. I still think it is a great game, just not a great fit in our small collection. I&#039;ve completely changed my mind and would rather set up and play Nexus Ops if I want a quick skirmish game and Memoir when we&#039;re looking for a longer game. Also if I had one negative I would say that the tiles are a red herring, you really can&#039;t get more than a few because you need to be grabbing points and someone else will run away with the game (just ask my son : )[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (9):

[i]- Beautiful production quality, especially the minis.
- Love the action selection board where you can only select certain actions once or maybe twice each turn.
- Turns are quick, this game moves along at a brisk pace.
- The pyramids/power tiles in the game add a lot of replay value to the game.
- Creatures have diverse powers and add a lot variety to the battles.
- Divine intervention cards add a layer of unpredictability to the game especially during battles.
- There is no player elimination, you win by having x number of victory points.
- Kemet discourages players from turtling, the majority of victory points are earned by being the attacker in battles. 
- Great combat resolution mechanic with the card system.[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]- Great, thematic art and some of the most amazing dice we have.
- This game is just fun, you can&#039;t help but smile and laugh when you play this. 
- Great gateway game that we have had great success introducing other families to. 
- Might be the easiest game to teach that I own... Roll claws!
- The cards add some fun twists to the game and are worth collecting energy for. That said, I only roll for claws and very rarely leave Tokyo.[/i]

My thoughts:

[i]We no longer use any of the power up cards, they just add unnecessary length/decisions to the game. KoT excels as a quick, accessible game and this expansion takes away from that. The only thing we use is the giant panda.

After playing over 10 games with the expansion I am lowering my score from 9 to a 4. Why? Even though the individual monster powers seem cool,they add something else to keep track of without actually being really beneficial.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition.
*Please note - This comes with everything but the Panda figure. All the power up cards and tokens will be shipped in the expansion box.</conditiontext>			</item>

Luckily this game is played over three rounds because the first round fell flat for me.
During the next 2 rounds things began to click and I started to see the different timing/strategy of when to lay castles vs. picking up tiles.
This is a very abstract game (shocking I know), but I enjoyed it.</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR])

[i]The one big negative I have for is that the game is usually is decided by the end of the 4th year. This is compounded by the fact that the scoring is all open, there is no hidden scoring like all of the civilization cards in Stone Age. This lead to me trading the game away.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Love how the dice are used as your workers, this adds some great tension to the game.
- I also like all the different ways you can choose to build buildings, there are lots of ways to combine powers from different buildings.
- Good family game, however I believe Lords of Waterdeep and Stone Age are better introductions to worker placement.[/i]

My thoughts and rating (8)

[i]- I love parts of the expansion, and would definitely recommend picking it up even if you only use some of the included modules.
- We always play with the expanded building boardsand the alternate building rows.
These 2 modules really add a lot of variety to the game and in my opinion are must haves.
- We played a lot with the soldier tokens, but I did not like how deterministic battles have become. I prefer the uncertainty of the reinforcements die.
- Sometimes we used the special adviser cards, but I have found that they can really unbalance the game if one person gets a really powerful ability. We have pretty much stopped using them.
- I do not like the random event cards that you would play once a year, they seem very arbitrary to me.[/i]</comment>				</item>

It was not the hit I thought it would be and I have a lot of other dice games I would much rather play.

My thoughts:

[i]The expansion really adds to this game and is the reason why I added it to our collection. My two favorite modules are the large dice (which count as 2) and the purple kicker dice.

In the end it wasn&#039;t enough to keep Las Vegas in our collection so it got traded with the base game. I&#039;d definitely recommend it if you like the base game however.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition, only played a few times.

My thoughts and rating change [COLOR=#FF0000]9 -&gt; 4[/COLOR]:

[i]This was another game we got early on and as such received a lot of plays. Since that time we have come to realize that we just don&#039;t care for most deck building games. It is just a mechanic I do not enjoy.

Love the theme, but I found the game play unsatisfying especially when yo would save up to by a rare superhero and then be lucky to actually get to play that card once. I found that in almost all of our plays that most of the game you were playing with mostly commons and a few uncommon cards from the superhero decks. Also set up and tear down is a bear. I did really like the different scenarios that you played each game, that added a good amount of replay to the game. 

In the end it is an okay game that I do not need to own nor play again.[/i]
</comment>	<conditiontext>Good to very good condition. 
I have played this game 20+ times and the cards are not sleeved, so the cards show some normal wear. 

Trade interest: High</conditiontext>			</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]4[/COLOR]):

[i]I still stand by my original thoughts on this expansion, I think it greatly improves the base game of Legendary. However; almost every deck builder we have tried has fallen flat with us and Legendary is no exception. I found the set up/clean up took too much time and was very fiddly. This is not a game I want to put 60 to 90 minutes into.
Still looking for the comic book game that we will enjoy.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]Played our first game with the expansion, most fun I have had playing Legendary. The game is harder and more intense, but not because everyone has a high attack value. Instead there are all kinds of new effects/powers that create a more challenging game. The new scheme twists are also very good, with lots of unique set-ups.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]4[/COLOR]):

[i]By now my feelings on most deck builders have been well documented. While this expansion added some interesting new powers, I had enough plays of Legendary already under my belt (20+) and this game was soon traded away.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]This is another solid expansion to a fun deck builder.
I really like some of the new abilities found in this set with villains, masterminds and the hero powers (specifically Focus). Card art is hit or miss depending on the cards, personally I did not mind the art in the base game as I found it to be overall of a higher quality.[/i]

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I have only played this once and initially my thoughts on the game were higher. Now that I look back on the experience I am not sure how often I would want to play this game. I love race games with card play [i](RFtG is a top 5 game for me)[/i], but I want a clean streamlined experience. 
I felt like L &amp; C was made up of a lot of starts and fits. The worker placement element is not nearly as elegant as the rest of the game. It is extremely inefficient to use those spaces to get goods [i](I am specifically referring to canoes and horses)[/i], I don&#039;t understand why I can only buy one canoe or horse each turn but it basically kills those spaces. I had bought cards that let me maximize canoes, but then I had to take multiple actions to get multiple canoes. You really need to focus on the cards you get to help you become more efficient with your actions and ignore the allure of the board spaces; then my question becomes why bother including all of the wp elements in this game, it just slows the play way down.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I had been looking forward to playing this for years and finally got my chance and wow was I disappointed. We played with 6 players and there were a lot of turns when 3 or 4 of us played the same cards. Then player order is decided by a number on your card... awful mechanic since this happened quite often and made the game feel much more luck based than it seems at first glance. 
The set collection was okay, but even then there really wasn&#039;t much tension and choice. 

I really enjoy role selection games, but I will stick with [i][thing=131357][/thing][/i] where there are very limited roles, but the bluffing mechanic really fleshes out the game play.
Libertalia felt extremely dry and mechanical, the theme fell completely flat with me.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Not sure where I stand with this one. I enjoyed my play, but it ran a little long and I didn&#039;t have any prior knowledge of the cards so players with previous plays have a distinct advantage. In some ways it feels like an optimization game in the vein of Rosenberg&#039;s games with a much different thematic feel. 

I feel like I would need further plays to really give a proper opinion of this game. I would play it again, but it wouldn&#039;t be my first pick since I didn&#039;t love the mechanics of the game [i](it also went long, but I am assuming further plays would shorten the game length)[/i].</comment>				</item>

[i]We got this game to play with our youngest daughter Lilly (she is 3) and I am happy we did.
Our kids all have fun playing this, and Lilly loves it, she is very proud to have her own game. She is very protective of her white chickens! This is a very fun dexterity game with great bits and it is very sturdy. Great family game, highly recommended![/i]

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]4[/COLOR]):

[i]Another okay game that we got when we did not have many games. Part of it may be the meta game that my family has developed, where everyone stockpiles cards before trying to sneak some ships by. This game is very light and really shows it&#039;s age when compared to other card games, definitely not a game I need to play again.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (6):

[i]This is a very basic trick taking game, with a few cards that have special powers. This game plays quick, so we play before bedtime or as a filler during our family game night. This game is a great intro into trick taking games for kids due to the ease of game play and great theme. 

This game plays well at 3 or 4 players, I would not recommend it for 2 players. This is my least favorite card game that we own; I would always rather play Morels, Jaipur or Guillotine (when we have more than 2 players). I would only recommend this game to play with younger kids as an intro into trick taking games.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Great family game, I believe this is the replacement game for Monopoly (at least for my family).
- You only score if your casino card gets flipped the beginning of each turn. This really helps in a family setting because you can have a huge 9 point green casino, but the green cards don&#039;t get flipped (this happened to me); meanwhile someone else who has a smaller 6 point purple casino keeps scoring it because purple cards get flipped.
- You know how many of each casino color has been flipped, this becomes important knowledge as you build casinos. However; it is not perfect knowledge because you do not see about a fifth of the cards each game. 
- Trading and negotiation: In this game it is necessary because at the beginning of your turn you get ownership of a random lot. This may be a lot you want, but more than likely it is going to be another player who really wants it. Therefore in order to get lots near each other to build on you will most likely spend lots of time wheeling and dealing. 
- There are ways you can really mess some one over and get ownership of a casino when you only own one of the tiles in that casino.
- The point track: at first you go up one point at a time, but then later in the game you need to have a casino that will score 2, 3, 4... in order to advance on the score track.[/i]</comment>				</item>

I was initially turned off of this game, in part because I figured it couldn&#039;t live up to the hype. I finally got the game and have not regretted it at all.

- My wife loves this game, which is always a huge + for me.
- The DnDeeples are amazing an really increase our enjoyment of the game.
- I love the artwork on the board/cards. Really well drawn fantasy art, everything is easy to read and understand.
- Family friendly design; my wife and older kids found it easy to learn played really well from the beginning. This is a very easy game to teach, the only area my daughter needed some coaching with was helping her figure out how important playing Intrigue cards could be.
- Turns go by very fast, there is not much AP in this game.
- Intrigue Cards: These make the game for us, they introduce a lot of direct player interaction.[/i]</comment>				</item>

I really enjoyed it, but my son did not (even though he won) which really surprised me.
He actually preferred the simplicity of the base game and did not like the skulls. He thought too much of the game was spent managing your skulls and not completing quests.
I do not think my wife or daughter would enjoy the increased complexity of the expansion either. 
I am fine just playing the base game with family and I would recommend getting the Lords of Waterdeep: Character Meeples instead of the expansion if you are going to play LoW with your family.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The scoring mechanic feels like an inelegant Knizia solution to scoring. For example in Tigris your score is the lowest total among all four colors; simple and brilliant [i](in my opinion)[/i]. This is something you have direct control over and can plan for.
In Xidit you score three different resources (fame, gold and buildings), but in the beginning of the game you randomly decide an order that they are placed in [i](first, second, third)[/i].
Then the person with the lowest total of the first resource is eliminated from the game. 
You score the second resource and again the person with the lowest total is eliminated.
Finally the winner is determined by having the most of the third resource.
The problem is that there are situations where you know you need a certain resource, but you just can&#039;t get it. I understand that this scoring system adds tension to the game, but at the cost of simplicity and elegance. Why not adopt the scoring system found in Tigris, your score is the resource you have the least of.

Overall I really had fun playing the game, and I especially enjoyed having to plan out 6 moves at a time and then see how things worked out based on other peoples actions.
In the end though, after playing a game for a few hours it really feels crappy getting eliminated from any possibility of winning because of a convoluted and wonky scoring system.</comment>				</item>

Received in a math trade (8/8/14). 

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]I can appreciate the importance of Lost Cities when looking at all the card games that have been influenced by it&#039;s design. However I would much rather play Knizia&#039;s Battle Line, which I think is brilliant in its execution. 

If I am looking for a game that is in the same lineage as Lost Cities I&#039;d choose Musée. Musee offers everything Lost Cities minus the wonky scoringand introduces a spacial aspect to the card play which adds more depth to the game but not complexity.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- A great cafe game, small footprint (you don&#039;t need the board if you don&#039;t have room).
- Very easy to play/teach, but Mr. Knizia found a way to make it engaging.
- I like being able to change the tempo of the game based on whether you deplete the deck of cards or take a card from one of the piles of face up cards.
- The push your luck element: do you try to wait for one more handshake or do you start that third or even fourth expedition?
- While the scoring system seems wonky at first it makes the game. 

I prefer Knizia&#039;s Battle Line over this, but both will stay in my collection.[/i]
</comment>	<conditiontext>Very good condition, cards are not sleeved and may show some minor wear [i]nothing that effects game play.[/i]</conditiontext>			</item>

Highlights:
- Theme and components really felt like they were connected to the game play.
- Played great with 2, and only took about an hour.
- Loved the combination of worker placement and area control.
- All of your actions felt like they were working towards a common goal, this is not a point salad game.
- Love working towards those bonus tiles, they really allow you to make some headway during the game.
- Once this game is set up it looks great, excellent production values.
- The candle/turn end mechanic... Amazing. 

Really this video says it all [geekurl=/video/31340/luna/lunas-blues]Luna&#039;s Blues[/geekurl]

[i]I really hope this game sees a reprint, I could see playing this game with my family. For now it sits on my wishlist, but I don;t have high hopes for finding a copy.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Wow, I really dislike this game. Yes it is supposed to be a light filler but there is too much downtime between turns. Maybe it was the people I played with, but this game dragged. It is also extremely luck dependent and while I don&#039;t mind that in a quick filler like Qwixx, Machi Koro is long and in my opinion quite boring.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Madame Ching[/COLOR] was traded with Akrotiri for Memoir 44.
Christmas gift from Mat 2014.

Initial thoughts and rating (6):

[i]- Beautiful artwork and high production values. I especially like the art on the movement cards.
- Ship movement; to me this is the most interesting part of the game.
- Hand management, planning how to play your cards to get your ship to where you want to go.
- The added set collection mechanic add some needed depth to the game, by offering a secondary goal when playing movement cards.

Overall I am somewhat underwhelmed by this game. It has such a beautiful aesthetic but the game play is quite repetitive. Some of the encounter cards can really swing a game and that doesn&#039;t feel fulfilling to me. Especially when the movement part of the game is so precise and requires careful planning. In the end I don&#039;t feel like the game rewards careful planning. Also your decisions are usually quite obvious, even for a family game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]4[/COLOR]):

[i]I don&#039;t have much else to say about this &quot;game&quot;. We played it again and there really aren&#039;t any choices to be made. You flip a card and do what it says. Yes you can play a card from your hand, but there really isn&#039;t much choice to it. Do you have a certain personality trait, if so you play it and that&#039;s it. Who you end up marrying comes down to the roll of a die.

My wife is a huge Jane Austin fan and she thought the theme was good, but agreed after a few plays that there wasn&#039;t anything left to explore.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (5):

[i]I bought this game because my wife is a huge fan of the show. I am not sure what to say about this one, it is not bad but it also isn&#039;t much of a game. You basically play cards and read the text which definitely brings out the theme of the game. However; the game is very straightforward you literally play a card, do what it says and then usually draw another card. The end of the game (the marriage proposal) comes down to a die roll.

Enough said, if you or someone close o you is a fan of the show it may be worth picking up for a few plays.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]This is the very definition of a mediocre game. It functions fine as a stock/commidity speculation game, but not only doesn&#039;t it bring anything new to the table it is also extremely dry. The art is a huge miss and fails to bring out the steam punk theme (it looks like free clip art). We did only play with 2 and completely lacked any tension, it was too easy to manipulate the board. I do think it would improve with more players but at that point I&#039;d rather get enough people together to play Medici. I would play this again with more players, but I certainly wouldn&#039;t seek it out.[/i]</comment>				</item>

- A really fun auction game with extremely simple rules and difficult decisions. Your success in this game comes down to how well you bid/manage your money.
- Tension: this game is packed with it, I really can&#039;t believe how much fun this game is. You really have to play it; Medici is not as dry as it seems. There is plenty of take that and jockeying for position throughout the game.
- I love any game where you are constantly reading people and past behaviors influence the decisions you make.
- Coming from behind to win was awesome (which is not something that happens to me often).</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]Ultimately a bit disappointing, I was hoping for a bit more depth. There was not a lot of tension in the decisions you have to make. We&#039;d still rather continue to play 7 Wonders in my house.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Quick drafting game (plays in a 1/2 hour).
- Great gateway into drafting games, much better than Sushi Go (and in my opinion almost as easy to teach).
- Best &quot;new to me&quot; drafting mechanic: as you draft cards you do not reveal them right away, instead starting with the first player each person plays one card and advances on the chosen track. This adds a fun card play and possible bluffing element to the game play.
- The &quot;advanced&quot; side of the jousting knights adds a fun tug of war element to the game.
- A variety of boards that all score a bit differently (although all but 1 provide either + or - vp&#039;s).[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>27</numplays>			<comment>Traded away in a math trade 4/14/14. (Received Castles of Burgundy)
Reaquired

[i]This was the second designer board game added to our collection. I figured my son would love the cool army minis, and he did.

- Excellent intro into light war gaming, and one that my kids can play.
- Due to the dice based combat, which is very intuitive, there is enough luck in this game that the game remains very accessible. 
- This was one of the best gateway games that I introduced to friends that had formally played Risk, etc. They were instantly hooked.
- Card play: I am in the camp that enjoy the tension created by never knowing if you are going to have enough movement cards to activate one of your zones enough times to pull of your plan.
- A lot of scenarios, which all have a different terrain layout, found in the base game alone which gives this game high replay value.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>[i]A great addition to a game my son and I love playing. His favorite part of the game are the tank battles and since this expansion covers the N. African campaign there are lots of tanks! I would recommend splurging on the map, it definitely enhances how the game looks once it&#039;s all set up.

There are plenty of scenarios and some interesting new rules for the British troops, but I would recommend this expansion based solely on the awesome armor warfare![/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>[i]- The sci-fi theme and the pick up and deliver mechanic found in this game. 
- Having to explore before you can really start selling goods because you are trying to find good trade routes to exploit.
- Even though this is a roll and move it actually has some thoughtful choices you need to make when navigating.
- The artifacts introduce some nice perks that may be found throughout the game.
- For a game with so much depth, it is relatively easy to teach once you have the rules down yourself.
- Plays great with 2.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I am a huge Uwe fan, so I was quite excited to try out his take on a pick up and deliver game.

Highlights:
- Plays relatively quick, I could see a 2 player game wrapping up in less than an hour with 2 experienced players.
- The rules are quite straight forward and simple, the game really is all about optimizing your trade routes (which I love).
- My son was able to pick this one up right away and do quite well.
- The time track, basically the players determine how long the game will last depending on which cities they visit.
- The ability to follow some one and get to fulfill a contract in that location.
- You increase the value of your contract when you complete one (complete a 4 contract and earn a 5); however you can keep contracts and fulfill them multiple times.
- Your contract is also currency, you are constantly having to choose between keeping valuable contracts or using them to by new bonus cards.
- Bonus buildings give you alternative ways to score vp.

This is a pick up and deliver game that is all about optimization, there is no route building to be had. So I can see how this game is not for everyone, but I love it and it has moved way up my wishlist.
</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Really streamlined pick up and deliver game. Not sure if it would get played in my house though. </wishlistcomment></item>

I will admit it can be a bit chaotic due to some of the character powers of the cards. 
I would definitely play this again and consider buying (since it is getting reprinted) because I could see playing this with my family.</comment>				</item>

[i]This game will probably be bumped to a 10 if I can get in some more plays, which will all come down to the gaming group I belong to. I don&#039;t think that this would make a great family game because if one person&#039;s bids are out of whack it throws off the balance of the game.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>[i]Favorite Knizia auction game, just not sure it would get played outside of when I&#039;m gaming with a buddy who already has a copy.[/i]</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>We&#039;ve been in the hobby for about 3 years now and finally got to play a game of Fluxx. I happily played with a friend and his kids plus my son. I&#039;ll be honest I wasn&#039;t expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked the monster theme, there were a lot of references to things I grew up with (Scooby Doo and Count Chocula come to mind). We had fun playing and the game didn&#039;t overstay it&#039;s welcome. 

[i]While it is not a game I would seek out, I would play it again with my kids. I also think it would be a great game for my kids to teach their friends.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]10[/COLOR]):

[i]This was one of our first games and my wife and kids still love playing this game a 3 years later. (Even after my wife spilled coffee on the cards.) I had the opportunity to play the new Fungi version and while I like the new artwork, I still prefer the original version&#039;s artwork. This is still one of my favorite 2p card games and one I highly recommend.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8.5)

[i]This is one of my wife&#039;s favorite games and it is probably my favorite 2p card game to play with her. I was also lucky enough to get the actual frying pans and wooden sticks, they look awesome.

- Excellent cafe game, this game has a small footprint.
- Great theme and beautiful artwork; I especially appreciate the different art found on the night time cards.
- May be the best had management game I own, the limit on hand size combined with that fact that you can not just discard cards creates a nice amount of tension in the game.
- Brent (the designer) is extremely helpful and supports the people that play his game. 
I have had two separate issues and he has generously sent me replacement cards![/i]

- The theme shines through, this game looks beautiful on the table especially once you finish your museum.
- Has a similar feel to other classic 2p card games like Lost Cities and Battle Line [i](*Musee does play up to 4)[/i]. 
- Perfect combination between ease of learning and plenty of meaningful decisions to be made.
- Excellent couples/family game, my wife really enjoys it.[/i]</comment>				</item>

I know Mat will shudder when he reads this, but I think Summoner Wars does this type of cards/tokens dudes on a map game much better. I think these games offer similar game play mechanics and I much prefer the pace/play of Summoner Wars.
I found Mythic Battles to be a bit fiddly, but I would play it again. </comment>				</item>

I&#039;ll echo everyone else, how can you not have different starting civ powers?!i can&#039;t imagine this game would have gotten any of the buzz it&#039;s had if it wasn&#039;t thematically tied to Nations, but really theme has been completely wasted. I also can&#039;t see this game standing up to repeated play, the decision space is too restricted. I am glad I got to play though because I love dice games and may have purchased it blind.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Another Kramer/Kiesling game that I got to play thanks to Mat.
While not my favorite from these designers [i](that honor belongs to [thing=129948][/thing])[/i] I really enjoyed it.

Highlights:
- Another innovative use of the wheel system found in a few of their other games [i]([thing=27173][/thing] and [thing=129948][/thing]).[/i]
You never know how actions will line up in future rounds which changes the price for goods and amount of free dock workers you get. 
- Beautiful components, great art in the game [i](once you figure out how the sails stack the built ships look cool)[/i].
- There is a lot of future planning that needs to be done, but it is not overly complex.
- Perfect balance of length and complexity, the game played in a little over an hour.
- Building combos when you complete ships is fun since you can piggy back the rewards you get from completing multiple ships.

This is definitely a game I would love to play again, unfortunately for me I think it is a bit heavy to play with my wife. She loves Palaces, but Nauticus is definitely a step up in rules complexity.
[i]This is on my wishlist, but not a priority since it wouldn&#039;t get much play at home.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>[i]- This game has a great pace to it and ends at the right time (you still want to do more, but at the same time you feel like you accomplished something).
- Variable end game goals (both street and bonus cards) add variety and can significantly alter how you play the game.
- Features the amazing artwork of Vincent Dutrait (quickly becoming my favorite illustrator).

I was weary of the hype with 1901 and my recent track record of new acquisitions hasn&#039;t been too hot, but I saw it for a great price and decided to buy it. I&#039;ve only had it for about 2 weeks, but so far I am quite impressed. NY 1901 seems like it may pull off what TTR has done, which is create a gateway style game that also appeals to folks like me that also enjoy heavier games.

Includes the Flatiron promo with the all the new cards.[/]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Nexus Ops[/COLOR] was sold via marketplace 11/1/15.

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]I actually regret selling this one; I actually forgot I had it listed in the marketplace and it sold months later... whoops. My original thoughts still stand and in the end I actually enjoyed it more than Kemet due to the simplicity of set up and teaching. I miss having a quick skirmish game in our collection, Memoir is great, but set up can be a bear.

I&#039;m actually thinking of trying to get a copy of the old Avalon Hill version since I like the minis better and it has the awesome center tile.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8.5):

[i]- Great replacement for Risk.
- Works really well as a 2p game.
- No player elimination, person to garner x victory points wins.
- The game encourages combat, that is how you get most of your VP.
- Fast set-up and gameplay, about 45 minutes to an hour.
- Beautiful minis for the units.
- Energize cards add to the replayability, especially combat.
- Alternate unit powers.
- Dice based combat is handled simply but allows for interesting decisions concerning which units to have fight.
- Set up of the board has some random elements which adds to the replay factor.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Received in a trade (4/30/14). 


Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]I enjoyed the plays we got in as a family, my favorite element of the game was the area control aspect that was brought into the WP genre. However; I never really enjoyed the combat aspect of the game, it never felt very satisfying. Also it was not a game that my kids enjoyed; V and I liked it but the 2p game feels very lackluster.

With so many WP games in our collection at the time Ninjato was another game that fell victim to the Jones Theory. Ninjato is still a game I would play, but I don&#039;t miss not having it in the collection.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Great theme, with beautiful production from the artwork to all the wooden shuriken.
- This is a great family game.
- This game is the perfect length, it plays in about an hour. Also the tension ratchets up after each scoring round (of which there are 3).
- The theme ties in very well with the different actions you can take.
- Ninjas, enough said.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Very good condition, my copy comes with 2 laminated player sheets that give a breakdown of the rules and list all of the dojo tile powers.

My son also played this game with us and did quite well.
I really enjoyed playing this game, especially the card draft that began each round. 
I think it would work well as a family game, my older daughter could definitely grasp this game.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]Wow, I&#039;m glad I never acquired this game because it was a huge disappointment. The game was much lighter than I expected with very few meaningful choices. I really disliked the magic way deck which serves as a bolted on catch up mechanic (basically if you have the majority of those cards you get 3 points). 

I also don&#039;t understand how this game is always mentioned with Balloon Cup as being two of the OOP Kosmos 2p games that you should own. Maybe time has not been kind to this design with all the new 2p games out there, but Balloon Cup has. Definitely not a game I want play again.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Similar to Sylvion this game has great art, it&#039;s really evocative of a surreal, dream like place.
- Very simple game play, but it plays so fast that it holds up well to repeated play. 
- 7 expansions, I&#039;ve yet to play with any of them, but they seem to add a lot of variety and challenge to the game play. This game could keep you busy for a while.
- Be aware that this game requires a lot of shuffling which is part of the reason Sylvion has seen more plays, plus I prefer the tower defense style game as opposed to the more standard card play of Onirim. 
- This has been a surprise hit with my older daughter (10), she&#039;s probably already played 30+ times.[/i]

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Highlights:
- Can&#039;t believe how well the theme ties in with the game play, especially since this is basically a trick taking game.
- The historical flavor text also has implications during the game since some cards can be eliminated if a specific card is played.
- This game took a few rounds to understand, but once it clicks all the different rules make sense.
- Having the ability to choose how your going to fight (air, land, sub each with their own values) really changes how a hand will be played, including who may ally with you.
- Temporary alliances: this game is all about forming alliances in the hopes of getting a share in the spoils. Love games where alliances are constantly shifting since there will only be one winner.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Pagoda[/COLOR] was traded away in a math trade 2/7/15. (Received 10 Days in Africa)

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]I really liked my initial plays of this game and I thought it was a beautifully produced game. However; after a few more plays it became apparent that you could really get behind the 8 ball in this game if you got poor card draws and couldn&#039;t complete floors to get the bonus abilities. I played too many games were one person got the cards to complete purple floors and therefore could have a bigger hand size; this lead to that person pulling further ahead because they had a better chance of getting the colors they needed. 

In the end that sucked a lot of fun out of the game, because it left one player feeling like they didn&#039;t have a chance from the beginning. In the end Pagoda had some very interesting mechanisms, but we encountered a serious runaway leader problem.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Another great 2p game I can play with my wife.
- Also a great game to play with your kids.
- Beautiful components. The game looks amazing as you build and eventually complete building the pagodas.
- Simple game play expanded upon by the special actions you can earn for finishing floors of a pagoda.
- Special actions: this is were games are won or loss, the abilities aren&#039;t game breaking, but they let you do a little extra on your turn which helps you earn a few more points.
- So far our games have mostly been close, thus the game remains tense as you play.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition, only played a few times.

	<numplays>24</numplays>			<comment>6/15/15 - I was finally able to get an English copy to replace my German one!

[i]- Plays great with 2.
- This is one of those perfect mid weight Euro&#039;s that plays in under an hour and can easily be enjoyed by my family. 
- I enjoy the tension created each turn by having to decide between building with the blocks you have or buying more bricks from the wheel.
- You also have to balance scoring points versus earning more money (to buy bricks) when deciding which cities to build buildings in.
- The end game is not static; you may (but you don&#039;t have to) declare the end of the game when you have meet certain scoring/building requirements.
- The alternative scoring cards can dramatically change the flow of the game. Sometimes it is an absolute sprint to the finish because the end game triggers are easy to reach, while at other times you have more time to build a better engine. I love how no 2 games feel the same once you introduce those cards.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]Ouch, my head still hurts from playing this game.
I love some heavier games, but this one pushed the envelope for me.
I found the game to be rather long (I played a 3p game and it took over 2 and 1/2 hours to finish), and really I don;t think there are that many interesting choices to make. You pretty much have to figure out how to most efficiently transport your goods to turn a profit.

The one thing I really liked was buying stock in your company and others, especially since you had to pay dividends out to your shareholders each round out of the company&#039;s profit.
If you couldn&#039;t your company lost value and you didn;t get money (personal wealth is the determining factor in deciding who wins, not your company&#039;s money).[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]- Beautiful artwork and high quality cards.
- Really fun card game that has the simple rule set of a game like Spades, but there is lots of depth to be found once you begin playing.
- Quick play time: 15 - 20 minutes.
This is currently my favorite trick taking game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

My thoughts:

[i]- Beautiful components (love the easels) with an awesome theme.
- Tile laying to mix colors [i](although it is more limited than I thought it would be)[/i].
- Easy to teach/learn and definitely a game you could break out with more casual gamers.

All of that said I was disappointed with this game.
There really aren&#039;t that many decisions to be made, basically you lay a tile, get paints, mix paints and fulfill commissions. For a game with so few decisions I felt like it really outstayed it&#039;s welcome, I played a 3p game and it went over an hour. This game held my interest for about half that time.

There is no tension in this game which may appeal to some if you are looking for a really casual experience where you can easily talk/chill and play a game with family and friends. However that niche is already filled by other games in my collection. In fact I would highly recommend [thing=147431][/thing] which has a great art theme, beautiful components, and some added depth but still offers a relaxing game experience.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Excellent family game that sets up and plays quick, meaning it will hit the table a lot.
- One of the most beautiful games I own, I love the patterns for the quilt pieces.
- Buttons are both your score and income, which really makes this game extremely tense.
- Time track, I love games that use this mechanic, part of your planning has to take into account how many turns in a row you may get or give to the other player.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[i]I enjoyed both plays of Patronize and would much rather play this over [thing=129622][/thing]. 
I liked the addition of the cubes you are collecting and the different &quot;suits&quot; of cards will trump a higner number when going for a scoring card.
All that said, I am not interested in owning this game. 
The rule set is a bit clunky and I don&#039;t see this game holding up to a lot of plays which is my problem with a lot of card based micro games. I much prefer a quick dice game like [thing=131260][/thing] or [thing=117942][/thing]. And if I want to play a card game I would choose a game that has ties to traditional card games like [thing=152162][/thing] or [thing=56692][/thing].[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]I really need to play this again to speak intelligently about it. I really enjoyed my first play, but man did it fly by. I think the one thing you need to wrap your mind around while playing is that there are not fixed scoring rounds (going to press), you choose independently of everyone else when to go to press. 

That is the key to the game because you don&#039;t want to fall behind other players and potentially either lose out on going to press one time or having to go to press before you really set up your reporters.

I love the theme and art (nice job Asmadi) and the flavor text on all the cards is great as well. I am really looking forward to playing this game again![/i]</comment>				</item>

Received in a math trade (5/15/14).

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]This game had a short life in my house. In a nutshell it quickly fell victim to the Jones Theory in favor of Thebes: The Tomb Raiders (which we already owned). I had heard a lot of good things about Pergamon, and I definitely enjoyed the bidding process for gold/where you could dig, but after that the game offered very few difficult decisions. Building the exhibitions with the tiles was fun, but the whole museum aspect of the game fell flat for me. 

In comparison I like how time track determines player order in Thebes: TTR and the fact that you never know what you are going to pull from a dig, even if you know what cards are in the pile. I also appreciate the different scoring opportunities in Thebes: TTR, where as in Pergamon you only score based on your museum position and a few bonuses along the way. Thebes:TTR also plays better with 2 and is quite portable making it a great cafe game. 

At the end of the day Pergamon isn&#039;t a &quot;bad&quot; game, but in our small collection I only felt the need to keep one archaeology game and Thebes: The Tomb Raiders won by a land slide (the same was true for my kids which sealed the deal).[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- The push your luck mechanic when choosing how much money you try to get which is also tied to which level of dig site you can excavate from.
- Putting together exhibitions is fun, as you try to put together all the different tiles you have excavated.
- My kids enjoy it, especially my daughter.[/i]

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]An okay 2p pick up and deliver game that got lost in the shuffle when looking for a quick, 2p game. I got this to play with my son because he loves Merchant of Venus, but the gameplay felt samey and the die rolls could be a killer (and even though MoV has dice, you feel like you have more time to overcome a few bad rolls which is not the case in Perry). The card play definitely added some variety to the game play, but not enough to draw us back in for repeated plays. We&#039;re still looking for the quick pick up and deliver experience that has a small footprint (We&#039;ve played Great Heartland and we weren&#039;t fans).[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (7):

[i]- Designed for 2 players.
- Pick up and deliver in under 30 minutes: When we don&#039;t have time for a game of Merchants of Venus we can pull this out.
- Theme/aesthetics: both my son and I enjoy the sci-fi/space artwork in the game.

I need to play it more to give it a solid rating, it could easily go up or down.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Another fun dice filler, this one designed by Reiner Knizia [i](a designer I really admire).[/i] I only got one play in and honestly don&#039;t know how I feel about it yet. I had fun playing, but it was at the end of the night so hopefully I can get some more plays in and report back in a year...
I also need to mention that the tiles in the game are amazing [i](similar to nice dominoes)[/i], I just wish the new reprint came with better dice [i](they&#039;re still light, wooden dice)[/i] but it&#039;s not a reason to avoid the game. 

[i]I have gotten so many dice games lately that I am holding off on acquiring this one until I play it more and weed out some of the other one&#039;s from my collection.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I will never play this game again, what a horrible experience. 
I only played once, but my buddy told me the same thing happened when he played which is the rich get richer while you wallow in the dregs unable to accomplish anything. There is a huge advantage to going first and it is not always possible to get first player depending on how your opponent puts out their seals. Add to that some of the take that cards where you can basically stop someone from having any actions that whole round, no thanks.

My thoughts:

[i]Wow, what a let down. I got this game to play with my youngest daughter (she&#039;s 5) and it bombed. I had read Joe in Colorado&#039;s thoughts a while back and he wasn&#039;t kidding, there really aren&#039;t any decisions to be made in this game. It is really just roll dice and see what happens. Basically you end up inching your way up the point track because you are continually busting. The way the arrows are laid out you will never use blue (except to get to the last space) and a few spaces in you need one color to advance and by that point you&#039;ve had to spend a die as gas. I understand it is a push your luck game, but it just ends up feeling very random and seems like it could have benefited from more play testing.[/i]

Received in a math trade. (9/14/14)

My thoughts:

[i]I traded for this game because I was looking for a light/quick push your luck game and I really liked the art. In a nut shell this game drags on and is quite boring (just ask my kids). You constantly flip cards only to draw two ships of the same color with a high attack value, thus ending your turn. Other times you flip over 10+ cards only to get nothing you need/can get because you don&#039;t have enough money. On top of that it is a bit gamery and not suitable to play with family and friends that are not familiar with a lot of games.

I would recommend Incan Gold/Doiamant, which is a quick playing push your luck game that your whole family can enjoy, instead of Port Royal.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating coming soon...

[i]Although I need to mention that I want to play this again because I may not have played enough to really see the strategy of the game develop.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (6):

[i]This game fell flat for me, the decision space is not very interesting since there are too many instances when your choice is very limited and therefore quite apparent. There is some thought that goes into watching what other people play because the round immediately ends when someone can&#039;t play a card on a trick (I&#039;ve experienced rounds where 2 tricks were played and then ended, not very satisfying).

I know that there is probably a bit more strategy to be uncovered with more plays, but your decisions will still be quite limited too often becuase of the structure of the game [i](way to many times when you have to play a color with no hope of winning the trick)[/i].

[i]I am not willing to put any more plays into a quick trick taking game that doesn&#039;t click right away since there are so many others to choose from [i](I much preferred the still very light, but much more fun [thing=151835][/thing] this month)[/i].

[i]I just acquired this game so I am looking forward to getting it to the table more. After I got to play it a second time it was a game I knew I would love to own, but at the time I didn&#039;t think it would go over well with my wife and older daughter. Based on all the games we&#039;ve played since then I think they will enjoy the game.
I ended up getting the original version of the game because I actually prefer the artwork and components of the original. Plus they removed trash from the game which is my son&#039;s resource of choice.

Everything I originally said about the game a year ago still stands today, this is a brilliant combination of auctions, resource/income management and route building.[/i] </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>So one of my favorite childhood experiences was being able to watch The Price is Right when I was home sick from school. One of my early childhood ambitions was to be on the show [i](and operate an excavator)[/i], but unfortunately it never happened. 
Then that magic moment happened, I was at TotalCon and Chris from [family=19168][/family] [i](one of my favorite podcasts)[/i] asked my buddy Mat and I to join a game of The Price is Right. I jumped at the chance, we also played with another Matt and Eric Summerer [i](who played the role of a contestant and Rod Roddy)[/i]. Needless to say the experience was a blast and brought back all those memories from watching the TV show. 

[i]If I find a copy of this game I will pick it up, it would be a blast to play it with my wife and kids and the rest of our family.[/i]

Received in a math trade (8/8/14). 

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]I actually regret trading this one, but this happens once and a while when trying to fit your collection in a small space. Everything I said a year ago holds true, this is a quick, easy to teach gateway game with a really cool &quot;board&quot; (basically a pyramid of dice that slide down as you pull one out). I&#039;ll probably pick this one up again when my youngest daughter gets a bit older, if not sooner.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (7):

[i]- Plays excellent with 2 and 3 (haven&#039;t played with 4 yet).
- Great family game (not surprisingly since it comes from Gamewright).
- Plays really fast (under 15 minutes) and doesn&#039;t outstay it&#039;s welcome.
- Great gateway/family game, really easy to teach/learn.
- Simple to play, but packed with meaningful decisions. 
- Really nice production quality, this game looks good set up.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition.</conditiontext>			<wishlistcomment>[i]Regret trading this one, can see Lilly playing this in the next year or so.[/i]</wishlistcomment></item>

- Dice as ships: each number is a different type of ship with it&#039;s own special power.
- Finding the combos between using your 3 basic actions and your ships special powers.
- Researching/ placing quantum cubes nets you cards which either grant a lasting ability or a one time ability 
(The card powers are great and work well and let you manipulate the game in different ways).
- Great artwork and production.
- It plays fast and remains fun throughout the whole game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played a 3p game at TotalCon with Mat and my son. We had fun playing, this is as much a screw your neighbor game as it is a race. Based on how you choose to play cards you can decide to focus on the race or spend cards to damage your opponents ships or force them to discard cards. My son had fun, but he wanted to spend more time shooting my ship, but I was focused on staying far away from him [i](knowing his tendency to want to blow my stuff up)[/i]. Although in at the end he had a chance to shoot me twice which would have caused my armor to drop to 0 and I would have lost my next turn. First attack, he hit me on the second attack... he missed and I was able to cross the finish line on my next turn. Great end to the game though.
 
I love the theme and the art on the cards really evoke the theme of distinguished gentlemen/women taking part in a race. However; the board art is really boring. I know it is a landscape, but it is quite blah, with very few colors and details added to the map. Once you are playing this doesn&#039;t matter at all as you are trying to plot your movement to maximize how far you can go and hopefully stay out of firing range of your neighbors. There are some interesting mechanisms in the game, I particularly like how you adjust your speed each round [i](which correlates to the # of dice you roll)[/i] by forcing you to discard cards to get the maximum # of dice [i](which is 3)[/i]. That is a really tough decision because the cards all have very useful abilities.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>First off, I loved the artwork in the game, the tiles and cards are beautiful. 
I thought it was pretty cool that the designer of the game designed the quilt block patterns for the game.

Now on to game play, this is where the game felt very samey when compared to Ticket To Ride. Granted you are building quilts and vying for different amounts of prize money, but the mechanics and strategies felt extremely similar. You are still managing what cards to pick up vs. when to buy certain quilt blocks. 

All of this is still fun, but I don&#039;t have room in my collection to have two games that play extremely similar to one another.
For me Quilt Show would fall victim to the Jones theory in favor of TTR and here is why; I love how the board develops when you play TTR it looks great.
In Quilt Show the quilts you make don&#039;t look that impressive; using 3 or 4 tiles to make a quilt isn&#039;t satisfying and they don&#039;t really look like much of a quilt.</comment>				</item>

[i]- Quick dice filler that you can play anywhere, with anyone.
- Great twist on the standard dice rolling game, the scoring adds some decisions and tension to the game.
- For such a simple game it is quite fun.

This is a fun filler that I may keep in my car to play when we are out at a restaurant or cafe. The choices are not that difficult, but there is some tension in the decisions you have to make. You need to balance taking white dice when it is not your turn with possibly limiting the rolls that will help you when you have to take dice on your turn or suffer a -5 penalty.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>This is a second copy I own.

[i]I enjoy playing with the expansions, but the game does take a bit longer because you are constantly looking for the different numbers and/or colors on the sheet. When using the sheet with the different colors in each row one of the other players says aloud what color/number combinations are available which definitely helps keep turns quick.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>This is a second copy I own.

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]Coming soon...[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Quick card game that plays great with 2 - 4 players.
- Another version of Qwixx that is simple to teach, with a clean rule set [i](perfect as a gateway game, especially for traditional card players)[/i]. 
- There is no Jone&#039;s theory here, both games use the same scoring rules but they both play very differently. 
- While this version retains some of the luck found in the dice version, you can mitigate it with clever play especially once you add in the wild cards.

This is a great translation of the dice game, I am always willing to play either of these games. This version has more depth than the dice version since you are not reliant on die rolls, but it is still a light, gateway game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Received in a math trade (11/10/14).

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]10[/COLOR])

[i]For a time this had become my favorite auction game (replacing Knizia&#039;s Medici), but has since been replaced by Modern Art (another Knizia classic). Out of the 3 I still think this is the easiest for new players to grasp, especially since everyone has bidding tiles so it is really hard to completely mess up the economy of the game, where as in a game like Modern Art a really bad bid can hand someone the game. There is also a lot of decisions to make in the tiles you decide to collect because there is no way you can do everything, and on top of that you can lose points if you fail to collect any tiles of certain groups. 

Ra ended up leaving my collection because my family had no interest in playing it and a lot of the other people I game with have copies. I still consider it an excellent game and one I am always willing to play. In my opinion Ra it is the closest to a gateway/family game when considering Knizia&#039;s auction games (I think For Sale is the best when considering other designers).[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Bidding tiles: obviously this is what makes the game. You can only bid with one of the 3 tiles you have in your hand which is extremely difficult since you may end up over paying for a group of tiles.
- Set collection: I always enjoy this mechanic in a game.
- Ra: Again there is a time crunch because once the Ra figure reaches the end of the track that round of bidding is over. This becomes especially stressful when yo are the only person pulling tiles/bidding at the end of a round [i](do I take another tile and chance getting nothing if I pull a Ra tile?)[/i].

This is an excellent game that I can see becoming a classic with more plays.
I am really looking forward to introducing this one to my family, I think it will be a great step up in auction games from For Sale.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR])

[i]This is one of those games that I really enjoy and will happily play my buddy&#039;s copy whenever it gets brought out, but it wasn&#039;t better than any of the dice games we already own (Cubist, VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game, Qwixx and Würfel Bohnanza) so it got traded. 

As an aside the ties to Ra are thematic only, this game has nothing in common with Ra (which is an amazing auction game).[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]I bought a copy of this at a local FLGS because I knew it was hard to find and I really wanted to find a dice filler I enjoyed that plays well with two. Mat taught me this game (2p which he told me was not an ideal player count) and while it was fun, I knew it was not what I was looking for. I can see how it would be really fun with more players, since there would be much more competition over certain areas (monuments comes to mind).
The scoring penalties wouldn&#039;t be so harsh either, since usually the person with the least amount of something receives the penalty. 

I would really like to play this with more players, because I know I would enjoy the game a lot more. However; I am going to trade my copy, mostly because I know this game would not see much play with my whole family (too many other games we want to play with 4) and the 2p game is not that fun.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Why did I trade this?</wishlistcomment></item>

My son and I had very little trouble figuring out the icons, I find that whole argument to be a little overblown. It may hold water if you are teaching this to a non gamer, but this isn&#039;t a game I would pull out in that circumstance.[/i]

My thoughts:

[i]My son picked this out at Total Con last year and we played it a bunch that month, then it sat on the shelf. My kids played it a few times, but my wife and I didn&#039;t enjoy it at all. I thought the game would be much more fun than it is, there are moments of fun with a lot of frustration in between those moments. Worst part is that I spent an hour applying stickers to the pieces this summer only for the game to never get played again.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Highlights:
- Excellent family game
- Plays in under an hour, even with four
- Extremely innovative blend of mechanics...
[i]Resource collection[/i]
- you are trying to manage which out of the 4 resources will be worth the most points by not only collecting them but also sacrificing them [i](discarding them from your hand)[/i] to the gods [i](the card most sacrificed is worth 3, the one sacrificed least is worth 0)[/i]. 
[i]Activating workers[/i]
- First you place a card from your hand into your tableau of workers, then you draw a card from one of 4 rows [i](each column in a row has 4 cards to start)[/i] and you activate the card underneath the card you took. This really creates some interesting decisions, because you may really want a card, but activating the next one helps your opponents more than you.
[i]Building Moai[/i]
Lets you sacrifice a card from the draw piles and then secretly sacrifice another card [i](giving everyone else less info on how many of each type are in the sacrifice pile)[/i].

[i]I haven&#039;t played anything like this before, it is an excellent, quick game that I can&#039;t wait to play again. Unfortunately it was never released in the States and Kosmos has no plans to reprint it in German.[/i]</comment>				</item>

- I wasn&#039;t sole on the theme until I actually got the game, but it works quite well, I love the art and the components are top notch (especially the dice).
- Dice building, you are actually constructing your dice (removing faces and popping on new ones).
- This game is just fun, trying out new ways to construct your dice is a blast especially since there are so many different combinations of abilities to try.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR])

[i]After a bunch of plays I really didn&#039;t want to play any more. The game has a clever set of rules, but they don&#039;t come together to make an especially exciting or tense game. I primarily played this with my wife, and considering the limited time we play games there was no way this was getting picked over any of the other card games we play together.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Quick card game that plays well 2p and more.
- Easy to teach, but really has some depth to it. You really need to plan out how you can play your hand of cards.
- 7 cards: That&#039;s it, you do not draw additional cards in this game.
- Simple artwork, but quite beautiful, with excellent graphic design.[/i]

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Relic Runners[/COLOR] was traded away in a math trade 2/7/15. (Received Saint Malo)

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR])

[i]Why did I get rid of a game I still rank an 8? Mostly because it was a game I got to play with my family and my kids enjoyed it at first, but then it languished on our shelves. I tried to bring it out at my game group, but there was never any interest. Since I am committed to fitting my collection on a certain shelving unit it got traded to make room for some new games.

I still think this is an underrated DoW game and is great for families, and one I&#039;d still play. However; be warned that while it is relatively light it is not a good gateway game. In the end I think that has a lot to do with Relic Runners lack of success. There newest game, Five Tribes, has enough depth to appeal to gamers while families can enjoy it as well.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Awesome family game that has some hidden depth to be uncovered; I am looking forward to some more plays.
- Excellent production, love how you build the temples out of different shaped cardboard tokens and the relics are really nice (they remind me of Forbidden Island).
- Great intro into route building (it is simple, but you need to put some thought and planning into where your routes are going to connect).
- It is satisfying when you finally get to go on a relic run after spending lots of time exploring temples and building pathways.
- Variable powers can be obtained by exploring certain temples (there are 3 colors of temples and they each give you different abilities or points).[/i]

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Another new to me game played at the library meet up.
First of all this is a great group for these kinds of games since we tend to be a bit raucous.
I think this game depends on having the right group dynamic, I could see it becoming very dry and procedural if played with the wrong group.

[i]All that said I would enjoy playing it again, especially since it plays so fast, but it is not necessarily a game that I feel the need to own. Partly because someone in our group has it and I think the more players the better, I would not want to play this with less than 5 or 6.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]An okay card game that will draw comparisons to No Thanks. You are drawing a card and keeping it or paying a coin to pass it to the next player. The person taking that card receives all the coins places on it. What does it add... more luck in the form of 3 cards being dealt to you which will added to the tableau of cards in front of you to find out who has the majority of each number. 

What is frustrating, and a missed opportunity, is that you have no control over your hand. Those are the cards you will add to your tableau once the round is over. The only purpose those cards serve is having some hidden information from your opponent. Since those cards can never be changed there isn&#039;t a lot of choice to be had, you flip a card and decide whether or not pass or keep it. The game is quick and functional, but I didn&#039;t find it fun or engaging. I really don&#039;t have much desire to play it again, I would much rather play No Thanks.

A note on components:
These cards are tiny! 2/3&#039;s of the box is taken up by wooden discs ( your coins), the other 1/3 is devoted to the cards. Really?! I understand that this doesn&#039;t having anything to do with game play, but it really detracts from the play experience.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>[i]- A truly immersive gaming experience, one of the first games I&#039;ve played that really tells a story of your particular adventure.
- The artwork is awesome, the tiles look beautiful and I love how the character mats and various decks of cards have sepia toned gesture drawings that look like they were done with ink in a field artists sketchbook.
- The production is top notch, there are absolutely no cut corners in this game, the $ of this game is definitely more than justified once you open up the box.
- Amazing how such a complex game flows quite smoothly after your first play or two. 
  [i]Overall I found the rule book to be well written and any other questions I had were answered on one of the faqs found here on BGG.[/i]
- I love how brutal this game can be, it really intensifies the stress you feel and forces you to work together as a team if you are going to have any chance at surviving [i](i.e. winning).[/i]
- The game does take a while [i](our games have been between 1 1/2 to 2 hours each)[/i], but time flies since the game is so engaging.
- By far the best co-op I&#039;ve played, in fact I already bought the first expansion, but we won&#039;t break it open till we play through [i](and survive)[/i] the rest of the scenarios in the base game.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>[i]High on the list because we still haven&#039;t found a COOP we like. While it&#039;s not our favorite genre, I think the theme of RC is awesome and one my kids would get into. It also looks like a meaty experience which is right up our alley. May be fun to solo as well... Maybe a Christmas gift if I don&#039;t get it sooner.[/i]</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>28</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Excellent translation of Race for the Galaxy into a meaty dice game.
- Beautiful art and production quality, everything feels/looks top notch.
- Much easier to teach than Race; the iconography is greatly reduced and the tiles have their powers printed on them.
- Double sided tiles are a great solution for the explore action, there are plenty of times when you really would benefit from both options.
- Having produce before ship is more intuitive and helps streamline the produce/ship strategy and
- Purple die; boosts the produce/ship strategy by acting as a wild color (effectively increasing the value of goods consumed).
- There are a lot of strategies to explore in this game giving Roll high replay value.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Initial thoughts and rating (10):

[i]I&#039;m surprised this game hasn&#039;t hit the table more, probably due to so many new games coming into our collection this month. That said I love what the expansion adds to the base game. Ambition doesn&#039;t do anything to fundamentally change game play or add any new elements to the existing game play a la RFtG (takeovers or the orb anyone?). 

Instead what Ambition does is add more variety to the game by adding a bunch of new start tiles, 6 tiles to go in the bag (some RFtG favorites) and two new dice types. The black leader dice and orange dice are awesome, many sides showing 2 symbols or the ability to buy back the die automatically if you use it for it&#039;s native purpose. Ambition also adds goals (similar those found in The Gathering Storm expansion for Race) which can give you some focus in your tableau buidling. What I like most about the goal tiles is that it is not just straight VP, instead you can spend the chits you get to act as a one time use wild worker die. Any tokens you choose not to use are worth 1 VP each at the end of the game.

All in all I think this is an excellent expansion and a must buy for fans of the base game. I love the ability to draft starting tiles in the beginning of the game and the new dice are extremely powerful but well balanced (you can only have 1 leader die and it is very difficult to obtain the orange dice).[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I played a 2p game with Mat teaching and had a blast. I love pick up and deliver games and this also added in rolling dice. Even with the dice this game never felt random, I always had options on my turn, maybe not always what I wanted but that&#039;s okay. The upgrade cards you get will definitely keep the game fresh because they can definitely alter how you will play the game. I also enjoyed optimizing my delivery routes in order to score bonuses on goods that either wanted a fast delivery [i](minimum number of connections between cities)[/i] or a slow delivery. I thought the game worked really well with two and I am looking forward to playing again.</comment>				</item>

First the similarities, in both cards you are collecting cards in order to play sets of colors to take control of spaces on the board. In TTR you are trying to complete routes, in Royals you are competing for control of countries and each type aristocrat in the game. 

The biggest difference in the games is that in TTR you can block people permanently (unless you&#039;re playing with stations), whereas in Royals there is a second card type you can draw called an intrigue card. You can play an intrigue card with the required number of colored cards to kick someone out of a space on the board. Late game this becomes extremely important as the board fills up with cubes.

I mention the connection to TTR because I think Royals is very close to being a gateway game or at most a very small step up in complexity. I enjoyed my play of this game, it is a very clean design without any unnecessary rules clutter. The game play is quite straightforward, but the decisions you have to make are quite deep. You really have to pay attention to your opponents and what they are doing. 

I would consider this the gateway game into the genre of area control. It is as interactive as El Grande (my personal favorite), but easier to get into.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>[i]I Really enjoyed my one play and even though the game is dry I think I could get it to the table at my house. I definitely think V would play since the mechanics are so simple.[/i]</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Rummikub... I honestly don&#039;t know what to say about this tile version of Rummy. It adds some interesting twists to basic rummy since you can use jokers and switch tiles from melds that have already been played as long as you use all the tiles. 

I only played one time with my buddy Mat (This also happens to be one of his favorite games). I enjoyed it, but I feel like a game this simple is all about nuance and I just don&#039;t have the plays to really judge how much I like it. I want to play with my wife and get her reaction, she may love it, but I could also see her suffering from major AP. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Like all of Drei Magier Spiele&#039;s games the production quality is through the roof, awesome art, thick cardboard tiles and beautiful wooden pigs that stack. 
- The game plays fast and is a great introductory racing game to play with young children.
- You are never out of the race:
 [i]If you roll a black 1 you can roll again. If you roll a black 3, and you are in last place, you roll again.[/i]
 [i]Once per game you can move the first tile of the track to the end, lengthening the race.[/i]
- I love the fact that children can really work on their fine motor skills by stacking the pigs and discs in all sorts of combinations(the rulebook actually shows tons of examples)[/i].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>RR is going on my wishlist, but it is definitely too heavy to be a family game at my house right now. 
I also do not think it would be quite as good playing 2p with my son. 
So for now I will play it whenever I get a chance at a con, etc.

My rating could go up with a few more plays, but for now it is an average game.</comment>				</item>

- Love the cube management, basically they are your ships, traders, scientists, bankers and historians (score keepers) which leads to lots of tough decisions to make when you are taking actions.
- Appears to be lots of replay value, especially due to the different technologies you can invest in which lead to different ways to score.
- There is a decent amount of player interaction since there is a limited number of buildings, resources and technologies.
- Nice production: the artwork is okay, I really like the over sized cards.

Looking forward to playing this again, not sure if I would buy it because the minimum player count of 3. I know my son would enjoy it, but I don&#039;t know if my wife and daughter would dig it.
Since guys in both groups I game with own it, it is really not a priority. (Although the game is cheap!)</comment>				</item>

Received in a math trade (2/7/15)

My thoughts:

[i]I have to admit I had high hopes for this game and was utterly disappointed. To sum it up this game ends up feeling very scripted. If pirates are rolled early you have no choice but to focus on walls and soldiers or you will get hammered with negative points. 

I ended up feeling like your decision space was very limited, even when you could flip dice, especially since you can&#039;t flip pirates and the people symbool is on the other side. Therefore you need to roll people naturally to do all the cool stuff and we all spent countless turns trying to get 3 to 4 people in order to build merchants, architects and jugglers.

We gave it 3 plays and each successive play was less and less interesting, therefore I will be trading this one away.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]Please note I haven&#039;t played the original game and I was playing with a bunch of sharks who new the game inside and out. The other players were telling me about the changes/additions to the 2nd edition and I definitely enjoyed what the new market phase added to the game. I could see how really good players could basically solve the 1st edition game (not that I&#039;d be able too) so the market added another way to score a variable amount of points depending how hard other people pushed it. 

I enjoyed having to figure out how to manage my income, keep track of the cards in my hand and still actually get something done in the game. The game is very demanding and would take a couple of plays before I think I would have a chance to win. It is not overly complex, but it does reward repeated play because there is very little margin for error and if you fall behind you&#039;re not going to catch up.

I really enjoyed my first play, but it ran long (at least 2.5 hours). One player had serious AP so I can&#039;t really fault the game, but it did detract from the experience. That said I&#039;d definitely like to play this again, but it is not the kind of game I&#039;d add to my collection or recommend to families (it is very unforgiving, especially if you don&#039;t manage your income properly).

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Yet another Knizia played this month and I really enjoyed it.
I was only able to play a 2p game and I thought it was great, however I read a lot of discussion about the 2p game favoring the first player and was a bit disappointed because I would probably primarily play with 2.
However; as I thought about it it wouldn&#039;t be bad since I would be playing with my kids and this could give them a small edge when playing against me (although they really don&#039;t need it).

Highlights:
- Beautiful components, modular board that adjusts depending on the number of players.
- Another simple to teach, but packed with strategy board game.
- Just enough different types of tiles to really make the game packed with tough decisions and lots of replay potential.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Another co-op that in the end falls flat for me. The game play is fun, but the theme is completely lost which is really the most disappointing aspect of the game for me. I don&#039;t know how you can take such an amazing premise (basing a game on 7 Samurai) and completely fail to take advantage of it. Everything in the game feels very dry and mechanical.
All that said the game functions fine, but if I am going to play a coop game I want to play something that is much more thematic and has some kind of narrative arc to it [i](I&#039;m really interested in playing Robinson Crusoe)[/i].

Updated thoughts and rating coming soon...

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

- Excellent family game and one my wife enjoys, it also makes a great cafe game.
- A game that plays very similar to Race for the Galaxy [i](one of my favorites)[/i] that is easy to teach.
- Multi use cards, one of my favorite game mechanisms [i](cards can be played to your tableau for points/abilities, used as goods or spent as currency)[/i].
- High replay value - a lot of interesting building synergies to discover through repeated play.

All of my comments reflect playing with the expansion buildings which are included in the second edition. I would rate the game a 6 without the expansion, I didn&#039;t think there was enough variety to the strategies you could try with just the base game. Once I added the expansion cards I really enjoyed this game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]I really enjoyed this game, perfect blend of strategy and negotiation. The use of the once around auction mechanic not only creates a lot of tense moments (every $ counts in this game), it also keeps the game moving along at a quick pace. The added dimension of having one player be in charge of placing the additional water each round adds further negotiation and planning, you really have to pay attention to everyone and make sure you&#039;re not placing your crop where the chances of it getting watered are slim to none. 

I would always be willing to play this game, but I think you need at least 4 players. Unfortunately even though my buddy Mat owns this game I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll get to play that often if at all, hopefully I&#039;ll get the chance at Totalcon this year.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Meet some fun folks at TotalCon (Brian and Dan) and after teaching them one of my favorites ([thing=129948][/thing]) Brian taught brought this game out. You begin the game by placing Tetris shaped pieces to build pathways on the board in order to collect books that are scattered about. 
Sounds easy, except the whole game is screwing over everyone else by moving the paths they need away from them while also trying to position the pathways you need into position. You can move pieces orthogonality or rotate them on any axis.
You are drawing cards which give you different abilities and each player also has their own deck cards that are even more powerful [i](but they can only be used once per game)[/i]. 

This was a really fun game, the take that wasn&#039;t really mean and half the time what you thought was really going to screw someone over ends up helping them out.

[i]I would recommend you check this one out, I was glad to play a game I never heard of before. The only problem is that it was designed and produced in Italy and had a small print run, so it is not easy to find.[/i]

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game [/COLOR] was traded away in a math trade 4/14/14. (Received Bohnanza)

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR])

[i]I was probably a bit hasty trading this one away, it was before I belonged to a regular gaming group. At the time I traded it away because my kids had a hard time playing it, especially when it came to the gold auctions. The other reason was the horrible art and mediocre components. I am very excited about Biblios Dice and will probably pick up a copy. I was really happy when I read how Dr. Finn streamlined the auctions and cut it down to one type (no more clunky gold auctions). I think this version will be much easier for my kids to learn.

Now that I have played Biblios I think the card version beats out Scripts and Scribes Dice, but I am looking forward to seeing how Biblios Dice compares.[/i]


Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- This is a fairly light game that my older daughter (8) can play.
- A game my wife enjoys.
- It plays well with 2+ players.
- Quick play time (less than a 1/2 hour).
- Dice rolling and dice selection to move up certain tracks to score points.
- The value of each track fluctuated because you can sometimes change the value of a specific column.
- The auctions, especially to be able to use all the dice yourself.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I played this with my son, and while we both liked it I found it to be very fiddly. 
You constantly need to check all of your cards and also base your play off of all those different powers.
My son plays lots of games and he holds his own but he found it hard to find a strategy in this game.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Fun bluffing game that I need to play again.
The problem for me is that my family loves Cockroach Poker, enjoys Love Letter and I love Coup so I am not sure that I need another bluffing game in this vein.
Definitely a step up in complexity from a game like Love Letter because you can &quot;tap&quot; cards to use their abilities.
It was fun and I would not turn down a game, but my favorite bluffing game is still Cockroach Poker.</comment>				</item>

Initial thoughts and rating (6):

[i]I saw this game mentioned on a geekbuddy&#039;s New to Me list. I ended up finding an inexpensive copy a few months ago and finally got it to the table. It is a very simple game where you are playing cards to collect resources trying to earn the most money for the resources you&#039;ve collected. There are a few worker cards that adjust the endgame payout of resources, but the game is still quite straight forward and seems to play out very similarly game to game. It&#039;s a game my son enjoys, so we&#039;ll get some more plays in, but there isn&#039;t enough there to keep this game in our collection for the long term.[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]2[/COLOR])

Since I only played this once I will stand by my original comments. In my opinion this is not a family game, nor is it very fun. This is probably the least fun game we have gotten, I have no desire to ever play this game again. That said I know a lot of people find it fun, it just did not work for us which is kind of a bummer since I love the concept.

Initial thoughts and rating (3):

Just played with mt two oldest kids (10 and 7) and the game bombed. We played for 45 minutes and we had 2-3 points apiece. Way too much text on the cards for this game to be accessible to my 7 year old. She is a good reader, but having a hand of 5 - 10 cards with lots of text overwhelmed her. My son wasn&#039;t really enthralled with it either.

Both of my kids play and love Summoner Wars, but SU is not nearly as approachable nor would it have the depth of SW to play at a higher level with other skilled players.
So a huge thumbs down, I am really disappointed with this game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

I would love to play it again, the one thing that stood out was that the cards have 2 suits, so poisoning the trick is a bit easier. 
If you play this just be prepared to possibly end up with a negative score, this game is not easy and would take a lot of play to become proficient playing it. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>[i]- I think this would make am excellent 2nd tier family weight WP game.
- The theme shines through; in both mechanisms and art/aesthetics.
- A lot of tension, especially due to the event track. You really can&#039;t wait too long to act or the man will come in and due it before you.
- The weather really helps the theme come through and forces you to plan ahead since every turn the efficiency of your actions can change.
- The variety of the contract cards really open up a variety of strategies to pursue, there is a lot of game in this box.

I didn&#039;t think I would get into solo games, but I&#039;ve been playing a lot of Loyang. Not only do I think my family would enjoy this game (trains seem to be a hit in our house) I would also enjoy trying it out solo.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]Obviously this is based on one play, but I was completely underwhelmed by the very basic game play. You can take 3 actions on your turn from a list such as draw cards, place tokens, flip tokens, play a card from your hand. Yes you could set up some very basic combos, but I never felt like I was accomplishing anything. 

Why, because it is very easy to have everything you do on a turn become completely undone by another player without any way to protect yourself. The the random nature of the card play basically kills the opportunity to set up actions you can execute on your next turn which means each turn is self contained and to be honest quite boring.

The scoring is fine if a bit formulaic (it feels like an inelegant Knizia scoring system that really just rewards you for treating each scoring currency with equal value). The end game trigger is extremely problematic because after it is triggered everyone gets one more turn (besides the person triggering it) making it a disadvantage to the player ending the game because they are out of actions and at the mercy of the other players. At that point the game could come to a stand still as people math out where everyone stands and then decide what the best play is for them. Not exciting to say the least, especially since some players will be so far out of it the only decision they will have is who to king make. This game feels like it needed more play testing and some streamlining of the game play. There isn&#039;t anything in this game that makes me want to play again.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This was the last game my daughter and I played at TotalCon, and it was an excellent way to end the con. This is by far the most fun I&#039;ve had playing a real time game. It perfectly blends the chaos of real time while still offering a lot of tactical play. The components are beautiful, the dice are really nice. 

The reason I probably will not add this to my collection is because even though you can play up to 8 it is not a party/family game that you can teach to anyone. There is enough complexity in how everything works that I could not imagine bringing this out with my parents or extended family at a holiday get together, where as a game like [thing=155362][/thing] is so easy to teach I have been able to teach it to a lot of people.

I will happily play this game anytime I get the opportunity as long as it is with 6+ players.</comment>				</item>

My thoughts:

[i]I can see how amazing this game would be if you could find a dedicated group to play it consistently [i](this isn&#039;t a game to bring off your shelf once or twice a year)[/i]. This really feels like some of the space conquest games I grew up playing on my pc [i](the original [thing=68287][/thing] comes to mind)[/i].

I played two solo games and I didn&#039;t find the [i](solo)[/i] game compelling enough to justify the time invest needed to set up and play. I also know that my son will not be interested in learning and playing this game long term. He&#039;s always willing to learn a new game and play with me, but I know he&#039;ll be done after one play so I&#039;m not going to invest the time in teaching him this game [i](especially since he showed 0 interest in it while I was playing solo)[/i]. I also don&#039;t have a group that would want to invest in learning/playing this game with any regularity.

If I had a time machine and could go back to my 17 year old self I&#039;d have played this game countless times with my old group of friends, but now this kind of game doesn&#039;t fit into my lifestyle. Maybe some day...[/i]

Highlights:
- Really tight auctions, every coin matters.
- Building an engine that will not only generate some income, but also score you points.
- This is an easy game to learn, but there is so much depth for such a simple game.
- The worker placement to determine the price of the card up for auction and determining bid order... perfect.
- Fires; yes they suck, but the firemen add another layer of tension to the auctions.</comment>				</item>

[i]The first time I played it I was completely underwhelmed. Then I got the game as a gift and played it a lot with my kids over the course of a month. Then it fell off a cliff, I think we all got tired of the game play and complete lack of a theme.

A lot of people have mentioned that this is a great gateway game, but I strongly disagree. I don&#039;t think it holds up to repeated play which to me is a huge part of what defines a good gateway game (Ticket to Ride and Camel Up come to mind).

I will also mention that I absolutely agree with Camel Up winning the Spiel last year. Camel Up has delivered every time I pull it out whether it is family, gamers and more casual gamers. I don&#039;t think Splendor holds a candle to Camel Up.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Easy to teach, quick play time.
- Great family game.
- Beautiful components [i](yes this is definitely part of the appeal of this game).[/i]
- Stripped down version of 7 Wonders [i](collecting resources to buy other card types).[/i]
- 3 levels of cards which are worth more points and provide you with a resource.
- Bonus nobles can really change how you play the game.
- You need to pay attention to your opponents and possibly take cards you don&#039;t need so they don&#039;t score easy points.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>[i]- The first memory game that I have found that is a blast to play, even if your memory is awful (which mine is).
- Typical amazing component quality from Drei Magier Spiele, everything is much bigger than I imagined (especially the board and ghosts). 
- This game looks awesome when it is set up, it really is inviting to children.
- Another game that is engaging not only to my 5 yo daughter, but also my older kids (13 and 10).[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[i]This is actually a deck builder that I could get behind. It plays quick, doesn&#039;t necessarily rely on deck thinning and has awesome artwork.
I am still on the fence as to whether or not I want to add this to my collection; I still would rather pull out Race for the Galaxy to get a quick card gaming fix. 
My biggest complaint is keeping track of your life total using dice or cards, it is very tedious. For now I will be content to play this game with my buddy Joel who loves this game.[/i] </comment>				</item>

[i]- Wow this game is vicious, you can destroy someone quick if they aren&#039;t paying attention. 
- Games last about 15 to 20 minutes [i](which is the perfect length considering the random nature of the card draws.[/i]
- If you like building card combos this is the game for you, it is possible to chain together 3 or 4 moves by playing 1 card.
- There are 4 different ship boards included and I was quite surprised by how they changed your strategy.
- Innovation, the combination of having to pay attention to your ship board and the way you play cards is unlike anything I&#039;ve played before. 

This is a really hard game to describe without visuals, I&#039;d highly recommend you check out [geekurl=/video/78697/starfighter/video-review]Marco&#039;s video overview[/geekurl], he does a great job explaining the mechanics of the game. It is easier to understand once you see how the board/cards interact.

All that said I&#039;m not sure how long this game will last in our collection since we have so many 2p games and I have a feeling this game could get old do to the limited card pool. However; I definitely think this is a game worth checking out.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]The Staufer Dynasty[/COLOR] was sold via auction 4/25/15.

My thoughts:

[i]The Staufer Dynasty is an area control game with some specific rules on how you move around the board and eventually claim spots in a territory. Mix in some bonus tiles that let you move for free or spend one worker to claim a spot on the board. There are also end game goals you are trying to complete, but in reality you can really only accomplish them on your last turn.  

Here are my thoughts, I would much rather play El Grande if I want to play an  area control game. El Grande is a much cleaner design with a lot less rules overhead. There is also much more player interaction in El Grande, you are vying for control of the same region in order to score it. In The Staufer Dynasty everything is indirect, it feels more like worker placement. Someone takes one space so you now need to take another spot. I also prefer the immediacy of your actions in El Grande, you get into it with people where as The Staufer Dynasty is a much more passive affair. 

My thoughts in a nutshell: El Grande creates an amazing meta game due to those tense, edge of your seat moments that you will be talking about during future plays. The Staufer Dynasty is completely devoid of those moments and therefore falls completely flat for me (it feels too much like a solitaire game).[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Steam Park[/COLOR] was traded away in a math trade 2/7/15. (Received Trajan)
Received in a math trade (5/15/14).

[i]Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]I really loved the theme and art of this game, building a theme park is a lot of fun thanks to the great components. I had a lot of fun playing this with my family, unfortunately after 10+ plays it started to get repetitive and my kids lost interest in playing. The real limitation of the game is the placement rules for the rides and buildings, after a while you realize that there really isn&#039;t that much variation in how you set up your park. 

There are also some buildings that are much better than others which leads to a very similar game play experience because everyone tries to be the first to grab those buildings. Same thing with the scoring cards, there are really only a few different ways to score points with the cards, the color just changes (i.e one cad is green rides vs. another card being blue rides.

That being said we enjoyed the game and it is a great family game, but after about 12 plays you&#039;ve seen and done it all. Playing it a couple of times a year would still be fun and the game would feel fresh, but I don&#039;t keep family games in our collection if they aren&#039;t going to see a lot of play. However; I think 12 plays is great for this style of game and we enjoyed the ride while it lasted.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Awesome artwork! I love all of the different rides this game is a visual feast for the eyes. 
I love building my park and seeing all of theses cool rides and robots in it.
- Great placement rules for the rides, they force you to really plan out your park in advance. It adds a great spacial puzzle to the game play.
- Easy to teach to new players.
- Great family game, my kids love the theme and game play. 
They find the simultaneous dice rolling a lot less stressful than in Escape.
- The &quot;dirt&quot; mechanic really ratchets up the tension in this game since you can not just focus on building the best park. 
- Multiple paths to victory, especially if you use the special powers of the different stands you can buy.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>[i]- I really enjoy the artwork (monsters are poking the numbers with sharp objects).
- After my first couple of games I was extremely disappointed, but after a couple of more plays the game really opened up.
- There are two unique mechanisms found in this trick taker:
 [size=6]1[/size]. There can be 4 potential tricks on the table at one time.
 [size=6]2[/size]. You have 3 scoring cards face down in front of you.
 Each time you take a trick you flip up the next scoring card and flip down the previous one [i](you only ever have one face up scoring card)[/i]. 
- The real fun of the game is balancing tricks you want to take, while making sure to force your opponent(s) to take at least one extra trick.
- I don&#039;t want to get into a complete rules overview, but you can read them for yourself [filepage=117519]here[/filepage].[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

This was our introduction into worker placement games and is probably my wife&#039;s favorite game. Personally I prefer other WP/action selection games[i](Agricola, Targi, Snowdonia, Agricola ACBaS and Lords of Waterdeep if I&#039;m looking for a gateway WP game).

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

- Plays great with 2 (probably my preferred player count).
- Plays quick with 2 (under an hour).
- Great family/gateway worker placement game, the dice introduce some randomness into the game so that you can not math your way into winning.
- Rolling dice to collect resources is fun as opposed to just collecting &quot;x&quot; number when you go to a certain location (a la Lords of Waterdeep).
- I enjoy the diversity of ways you can score points [i](set collection, building huts, collecting builders, shaman or farmers)[/i], I like going for the civ cards.
- Beautiful board art and really nice components.

[i]This is one of my wife&#039;s favorite games and I have been threatened with bodily harm if I trade this game... until today![/i]

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Highlights
- Upfront planning; you really need to have a plan in this game and pay attention to all 5 rounds, making sure you pinpoint what the auctions will be for you based on the hidden goals you have.
- Auction mechanic is excellent, you start the game with 24 bidding cards for 35 auctions. 
- Income management; you need to win an auction to sell goods, which forces you to pay attention your income.
- The ability associated with being 1st player [i](lets you build the city tile)[/i] or 2nd player [i](lets you build the chapel)[/i] makes that auction quite competitive. </comment>				</item>

You really need to think about how you position your players. 
Even though you are relying on dice rolls I didn&#039;t find this game to be very luck dependent.

- The aesthetic tie in with Suburbia [i](and that&#039;s where it ends, this game is nothing like Suburbia)[/i].

[i]- Plays well with 2, I also really enjoy it with 3 (haven&#039;t played with 4 and I&#039;m not sure I want to).
- Sim City the board game, enough said.
- Nice components, I actually really like the graphic design and aesthetics in this game. Once you finish constructing your city it looks great.
- I really enjoy all the different ways the various tiles interact with each other, and the variety of the buildings themselves.
- Having to balance your income versus reputation is really difficult and since different tiles come out every game, this is a game you can play a lot.
- This game is usually pretty tight and the winner is not decided till the end.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Initial thoughts and rating (10):

[i]- Excellent family game to play with your kids.
- Another 2p gem that plays in about 30 minutes.
- Almost endless replay value due to all the different factions you can play.
- Faction balance even though most factions have very different play styles.
- Rewards repeated play, it definitely helps to know the cards in each deck.
- Lots of dice rolling built into a game that rewards skillful play, most of the time the better player will win.
- However; when playing with less skilled players they can pull off the upset, combat is not deterministic.
- The map really makes this game shine, you have the added component of having to think about movement and placement of your troops on a board. 

I also owned the following factions:
Guild Dwarves vs Cave Goblins
Phoenix Elves vs Tundra Orcs
Guild Dwarves 2 Summoner
Phoenix Elves 2 Summoner[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]- The perfect translation of a video game into a board game (I sunk countless hours into I Dig It HD for iPad).
- Excellent family game, it&#039;s easy to learn, has a fun theme and plays quick.
- A deck builder I really like for two reasons:
1. You don&#039;t have to cycle cards out of your deck, they are all useful.
2. Your deck is small (after an average game you probably have 12 cards in your deck).
- Combos are relatively easy to set up, you can piggy back a bunch of actions together using artifact powers and the one time powers you get from buying cards.
- The addition of the goal cards add a lot variety in how you score points and help kids see different combos and plan ahead.
- I love the tactile nature of the game, I enjoy seeing the board fill up with tunnels we&#039;ve dug[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Survive[/COLOR] was traded away in a math trade 3/17/15. (Received Camel Up)

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]): 

[i]Unfortunately this stopped seeing play in favor of other gateway games with extended family (Camel Up and Diamant to name a few) and my kids didn&#039;t really want to play so I traded it away. In my opinion this is still a great game to introduce to family and friends that are new to the hobby. I definitely prefer it over The Downfall of Pompeii.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- A great introductory family game as long as your family can deal with some take that game play.
- I have found that it plays well with 2, we each play 3 colors and use the overcrowded variant. This helps ensure lots of meeples getting eaten.
- Extremely easy to teach, making it a great family game.
- Beautiful components, especially the sea creatures.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Condition: Very good, components are stored in the original insert (which is really nice for this game).

Edition: English fourth edition (30th anniversary)

Sweeteners:
Survive: Escape from Atlantis! 5-6 Player Mini Expansion
Survive: Escape from Atlantis! Dolphins &amp; Dive Dice Mini Extension
Survive: Escape from Atlantis! The Giant Squid Mini Expansion 

[i]*I will only trade with all the expansions included.[/i]</conditiontext>			</item>

My thoughts:

[i]This is my favorite mini expansion for Survive and the only one I would buy if I were to get the game again. I love the game with 5 or 6 when playing the overcrowded variant. Also, when we play 3 players we each control two colors of meeples and use the overcrowded variant. Again this adds to the ensuing carnage and hilarity that ensues.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Will only trade with base game.</conditiontext>			</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]4[/COLOR]):

[i]I am rethinking my initial thoughts after playing with the dive dice a lot. I find that there are too many turns when you are just moving a boat or a dolphin. I definitely prefer the red die. On top of that the dolphins are way under powered compared to the tile. Dolphin meeples protect swimmers, but they only move one space. The dolphin tile is actually useful because it allows you to move a swimmer 3 spaces.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]Much prefer the dive dice versus the red creature die. 
The expansion is worth it just for the dice. I could take or leave the dolphins, but my daughter loves them so we always play with them.[/i]

My thoughts:

[i]The squid are fun but not necessary although they look great on the board. We have definitely found that you rescue a lot less meeples because if you move a squid next to an island tile with a meeple on it the squid can eat the meeple. Because of this we use the squid once and a while; I would not recommend it to someone picking up the game.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Will only trade with base game.</conditiontext>			</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]After my initial excitement I ended up buying a copy. After a couple of plays our interest quickly faded and I ended up trading it. For my money Medieval Academy is the better drafting family/filler game (and even that game is on the bubble for me).[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Excellent gateway into card drafting games.
- The art is perfect for this game, great color palette.
- Quick filler that is perfect for beginning/ending a game night.
- Plays great with 3+ players.
- Excellent card quality except the backs of the soy sauce promo don&#039;t match my copy.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition, played once. Cards have a linen finish in my edition.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Some of the best artwork I&#039;ve ever seen [-]in a board game[/-], period.
- This art in the game creates this surreal world which really immerses me in the game.
- I love the way you draft the deck of cards you&#039;re going to play and it also increase replay and encourages you to try different deck compositions.
- This is a tower defense game that I don&#039;t need a computer to play!
- You can easily set this up and play in 30 minutes or less.

Up until recently I haven&#039;y played many solo games [i](well since playing Risk solo as a kid)[/i], but I was drawn to this game and Onirim because of the art. I&#039;m happy to say this game also delivered on creating a really fun solo game that is quick to set up and delivers a fun tower defense style card game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]This game fell completely flat for me. The different actions in the game did not coalesce into a fun gaming experience. The set collection is very basic and underwhelming, the route building served as a means to an end, but the bidding was somewhat interesting although it felt clunky. 

I think that sums up my feelings on this game perfectly, Taj Mahal is a clunky and counter intuitive game to play. Where as I feel that Medici, Modern Art and Ra all offer elegant and simple rules, my play of Taj Mahal felt like a slog. The previous 3 games can be taught in a matter of minutes and even if you don&#039;t play well it&#039;s more of a lack of understanding of the perceived value of the various items you are collecting; the actual bidding/auction mechanics are clean and intuitive. I can&#039;t say the same for Taj Mahal, and there is really nothing there that is calling me back to play it again (especially since I could be playing Modern Art, Ra or Medici).[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]- This is by far the most beautiful game we own; I love looking at the board as we play with all the bamboo growing.
- The panda and farmer are really well painted minis.
- The game oozes charm; people will be drawn in because of the great components.
- Easy to learn rules (we do not play with any variants).

I believe this is an excellent family/gateway game with easy to pick up rules. Takenoko oozes charm; people will be drawn in because of the great components. This game does have some luck involved, but that is great for a family game that you are going to play with younger kids and more casual gamers.[/i]

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>[i]- This expansion just makes Takenoko even more fun! All of the additions enhance game play and build on what players already know, there isn&#039;t any added complexity. 
- Mama panda is adorable, my girls instantly fell in love with her.
- Added scoring cards which add more global challenges (x # of watered tiles of a color, etc.).
- The new* tiles are all awesome and help pick up the pace of the game. 
- Panda babies which give you points and a one time special ability.
- In my opinion one of the few &quot;must have&quot; expansions I own.

*New tiles - an extra water tile, a tile that can grow all 3 colors of bamboo, 1 tile in each color that grows bamboo on all the same colored tiles and one that lets you look through the top card of each deck and choose 1.[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]- Excellent 2p only worker placement game.
- The board is laid out in a grid which adds a spacial element to placing your workers.
- Once you place your workers you will get the good/action on that card and the cards where your workers intersect in the grid.
- Cards on the edge are always the same, but the cards in the middle rotate between goods tiles and tribal cards (which award points).
- Tribal cards have different synergies between them.
- When you play a tribal card you also have to consider it&#039;s placement in your tableau because this will effect how you score it.

Overall this is an extremely innovative worker placement game that I would highly recommend.
It has become one of my favorites and I haven&#039;t played another wp game that feels at all similar.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Another game that was donated to the library from Rio grande.
I was interested in playing this partly because most of Donald X&#039;s games do not click with me [i](Dominion, Greed and now this)[/i].
The one game I enjoyed was Kingdom Builder [i](I only played once but I am looking forward to getting an opportunity to play again)[/i].

I though the game was mechanically sound, but it did not feel like a time travel game at all. It is another play a card, take some gold or points and move on.
This game did nothing to stand out to me, and the whole switch time between 2 different cards felt very unnecessary since both locations allowed you to do similar things.
On top of that I found the artwork and components to be quite blah and uninspired. </comment>				</item>

- The first thing you get is your own faction to play, each with a very distinctive set of powers/ play style.
- This game is heavy, but it does not take long to understand how the game works.
- There are a lot of variables in the game which will make each game a unique experience. 
- There is so much you want to do, but your actions are limited really forcing you to focus on how you are going to score points.

[i]- Works well with all player counts (2 - 4) although I find it to be a bit easier with just 2 since there is less competition over the cards.
- Great adaptation of Thebes as a card game
- I really like how the different draw piles refill, you are never sure when the right time to dig is.
- Multiple ways to get vp: most knowledge of a color, museum shows, trading in artifacts and the artifacts themselves.
- Turn order is dependent on how long your actions take, like Glen More and Thebes you could potentially have multiple turns if you take actions that don&#039;t cost a lot of time.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Thunder Alley[/COLOR] was traded away with Great Heartland Hauling Company, Las Vegas Boulevard and Sushi Go for Fleet/Fleet Arctic Bounty (with all KS rewards), Friday and Viva Java the Dice Game 12/29/14.

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]This is a tough one for me to talk about a year later. Obviously it didn&#039;t stand the test of time, but part of that was due to my wife and son really disliking the game (which really surprised me). I think the game length was the real deterrent and I also felt that it ran long for what it offered. With that said, I still think this was a really fun racing game with some great card play. My daughter loved this game, but we never played with 2, I thought the experience would be anti climactic since you&#039;re only racing one other person. 

I would still enjoy playing the occasional game and a buddy of mine has a copy so hopefully that would happen. Due to the length of the game I&#039;d be happy to play Thunder Alley once or twice a year.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (9):

[i]- You feel like you are racing a team of cars, this game is fun!
- This is an excellent family game, my kids love it.
- The rules are pretty straight forward and it is really easy to teach once you are comfortable with the rules.
- The card based play is great, it adds a different kind of strategy than dice would.
- The different types of movement really give you lots of options when deciding on which car to activate with which card.
- The damage tokens add tension to the game without being overly punishing.
- Really nice production, you get four race tracks in the box![/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition, also note all the chits have been trimmed using a counter cutter.

[i]My biggest surprise of the month, especially considering that I&#039;m not a huge fan of co-ops. The game play was both fun and familiar (I think I&#039;ve played all of Matt Leacock&#039;s co-op games) so we were able to dive right in after a very short rules explanation. For me it was the theme that made this game truly shine even though I&#039;m not huge Thunderbirds fan; it was the fact that all of us role played our characters making the game extremely funny and a blast to play.[/i]

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I was really interested in trying it out since there are definitely some gamers that prefer this over TTR [i](which is a game I love)[/i].

Well Joel was right, I played a game with my two older kids and we weren&#039;t impressed. [-]I really didn&#039;t like the hand management aspect of the game [i](every time you finished a route you lost your cards)[/i], that pretty much killed the game for me.[/-] [i](I found out I was playing the game wrong, you only discard down to 3 cards)[/i]. As others have noted, I felt that the game really pushed you to get your 7 carriage as quickly as possible, making the game somewhat one dimensional. </comment>				</item>

[i]We didn&#039;t play this game until we had been gaming for over 1.5 years.
I was hesitant to get it because I thought we would find it too light, well I was wrong my whole family enjoys this game.

- Simplicity of choices: take trains, build routes, choose new route cards.
- My wife loves it!
- A very fun, relaxing game to play. (In the same vein as Finca and Takenoko)
Don&#039;t get me wrong, things still get tense when you think you have been cut out of a certain city, but usually you can find some way to get where you need to go.[/i]

[i]- 2 new maps that completely change the feel of the game...
- The Team Asia map forces you to pay attention to what your teammate is doing so you can help them [i](you can&#039;t discuss/show them your hand/tickets)[/i].
- The Legendary Asia map adds mountain routes (you need to spend extra trains to complete them), which can really push the end game.
- the Legendary Asia map also has ferry routes which give added importance to the locomotive cards.[/i]</comment>				</item>

[i]Initial thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

Tides of Time is definitely a fun 2p drafting micro game, but it&#039;s still a micro game. The game play is clever, there are plenty of choices to be made when it comes to the end of each age and you need to decide which card to build (and permanently have in your tableau) and which one to remove. It&#039;s a testament to the designer that he could pack in so many decisions into an 18 card deck. I have enjoyed my plays of the game , but in the end I am left wishing that this had been developed into a full fledged game instead of a microgame (selfish I know). 

All that said I would definitely recommend checking ToT out, especially since it is so inexpensive and portable. It is by far the best micro game I&#039;ve played (but I&#039;m realizing that micro games just aren&#039;t my thing).[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]10[/COLOR]):

[i]I still think this is an amazing game and hopefully I will get to play it more. This is definitely a game that requires repeated play in order to start to pick up all the nuances of game play. As is often joked about, this has been a game I&#039;ve brought to meet ups and it&#039;s usually ignored. I was hoping with the reprint that there would be some renewed interest, but so far I haven&#039;t seen it. 

I am glad to have played this classic game, it provides a lot of insight into modern board game design and in my opinion is a must play game.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (9):

[i]Absolutely loved my first play of this with my family. 
It only took one play to realize why this game is considered a classic. 

- Brilliant scoring system; you need to make sure that you are scoring points consistently in all four colors.
- Love the interaction between the leaders, there is only conflict if two of the same type of leader are in the same territory.
- Two types of conflict (revolution versus war) which are both caused/resolved using different tiles.
- Accessible to my older kids (9 and 12), but they have played a lot of other games.
- I am one of those people that find this game thematic (even though you are collecting colored cubes for vp). I thing it is interesting to watch the territories grow and expand and then splinter off into different territories. The monuments make thematic sense, they are the artistic pinnacle of each civilization. 
Granted everything takes place on a very macro level, but I think the civilization building theme makes sense.[/i]</comment>	<conditiontext>New in shrink.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Was taught this game by Mat and thought it was okay.
While some of the different restraints on moving the various pieces was interesting (especially how the diva only moved between her two bodyguards) it is not a game I feel the need to add to my collection.
I find some of Knizia&#039;s other card games are not only more streamlined, but also offer more interesting tactical decisions ([thing=760][/thing] springs to mind).
I also prefer the push your luck aspect found in [thing=50][/thing].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]I really enjoyed my play of TE Galaxies a lot more than the Kingdoms. Similar to a game like RftG because this game is definitely a race, you are trying to maximize your die rolls to capture planets and score points. The dice in work well, there is plenty you can do on your turn to mitigate luck (especially since you can burn energy to re-roll any number of dice as many times as you want). Most of the planet abilities offer you the ability to manipulate one aspect of the game, whether it be gaining a specific type of resource or helping you capture planets. I think it was an excellent decision for your opponents to also benefit from the planet actions, you always recieve more of a benefit but you need to be careful what the ramifications are to helping out your opponent(s).

I&#039;m not sure whether this is a + or - but this game is definitely a filler. There are decisions to be made, but there is not a lot of variance in how the game will play out. There didn&#039;t seem to be radically different strategies, just slight tweaks in how you go about winning the game. Therefore for me it is a pass since I think the engine driving the game is similar to RftG or Roll and I&#039;d rather play either of those games since they offer a lot more depth and variety in the way you go about building your engine (Race plays quicker, Roll may be a bit longer than Galaxies). That said if you are looking for a simpler engine building/race game I would recommend checking out TE Galaxies and I would definitely play again.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]As a family we never really got into Tobago. The bits were beautiful, but there were parts of the game that really fell flat for us. Our two biggest problems were the SUV movement and the treasure mechanic. As far as the SUV movement was concerned it was not very intuitive and if you started using amulets you really had too pay attention to how many movement actions you used. The push your luck element with the treasure deck was never that exciting; sometimes it felt like you did all this work only to get nothing because a curse popped up before you had a chance to grab some loot.

In the end we loved playing cards to locate the treasure, but that was not enough to save it from being traded after a few plays.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- Component quality: This game has some beautiful wooden huts, palm trees and jeeps plus these amazing Easter Island statues. 
The board is made up of 3 sections that can be attached in different ways to create over 30 different maps.
The game oozes theme thanks to the beautiful components.
- We love narrowing down where treasure is located by playing cards, a really innovative mechanic.
- Amulets: add some variety to the game by letting you perform extra actions and protecting you from curses.
- Driving your jeep around the board is just fun.
- I love the push your luck element to disperse the treasure. 

I believe this is an excellent family/gateway game with easy to pick up rules. It is not a game we will play every day/week, but I can see us pulling it out once or twice a month and enjoying it.[/i]</comment>				</item>

I wouldn&#039;t go into a game of Tokaido looking for depth of strategy, in my opinion it is an experience game. You truly feel like you are walking along this path and experiencing the journey. 

When you are looking for a game to play after a particularly stressful day and you need to relax take Tokaido off the shelf, sit back and enjoy a sublime experience.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>[i]Really enjoyed this one, another zen game. The problem is it probably wouldn&#039;t get much play after the first few games since I don&#039;t think it be a stand out with my kids.[/i]</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Traders of Osaka[/COLOR] was sold via auction 11/5/15.

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- I love the art/Japanese theme of the second edition.
- Set up is a breeze, plays fast and is excellent with 2.
- Relatively small footprint making it an excellent pub/cafe game.
- Speaking of footprint, kudos to Z-Man for packaging this in a small box!
- This game has a lot of take that, but it&#039;s not nasty which makes it a great game to play with older kids.
- This is a simple game, but it demands planning ahead and really figuring out how to manipulate the market to make sure you benefit when boats get scored (and make sure you don&#039;t lose goods when boats get caught in the tidal waves).[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Highlights:
- A deck builder with a board
- Scoring based on the tracks you lay and cards you can purchase
- I enjoy having to manage the waste cards that you build up, it adds some tension to the game.

I will admit that I was hesitant at first when this game got brought out because I really don&#039;t like Dominion.
Definitely high on my want to play again list, especially with my family.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Another hit in the Lookout 2p player line [i](which in my opinion has replaced the Kosmos 2p series of games in terms of quality)[/i].
- Relatively small footprint making it a great cafe/pub game.
- The theme is a little dry, but thankfully the choice of art is awesome [i](Lookout used historic illustrations and original art by Klemens Franz)[/i].
- Another new game that builds on Lost Cities and, in my opinion, is a superior game [i]([thing=163056][/thing] and [thing=140934][/thing] being the other two)[/i].
- Multi use cards [i]( cards can be played as currency, train routes or passengers).[/i]
- A very tense hand management game, routes always need to be played in ascending order [i](a la Lost Cities)[/i] and you must have trains you purchased to keep your routes in play .
- Probably the most innovative mechanism in the game is how scoring works.
  In a nut shell you are playing passengers to certain stations and once there are 4 passengers all routes of that color score [i](whether or not you and your opponent have any routes in that color)[/i]. After 10 scoring rounds the game is over, this really keeps the game moving and can really mess you over if you don&#039;t get into rhythm with the scoring rounds.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>[i]Really interested in the newest 2p from Lookout, but I&#039;m waiting to see a few videos to figure out if it would break into our 2p game rotation.[/i]</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[i]I absolutely love the aesthetic of this game. I always appreciate minimal design and the art in this game pulls it off quite well. 

The game play is fun, if a bit wonky. The rules are obtuse and make everything sound much more complex than it is. In the end it is a very simple push your luck game with great art. I do think that the game can devolve into a betting game in later rounds because you have no choice but to try and score big knowing you have no other way to win. This could potentially dilute the experience and make it less about bluffing and more about gambling. Still, I had fun playing and think this could definitely be a fun, family game. I&#039;m looking forward to playing it again.[/i]</comment>				</item>

- Beautiful production, even with unpainted gears. 
- The artwork on the board/tiles really evokes the theme in a very simple/clean way.
- A unique entry into the worker placement genre that feels fresh and different.
- Planning and using the gear mechanism well is a delicious puzzle to solve.
- This is a game you continue to think about after you play, there is a ton of decision space to explore.

[i]I really enjoyed my play of this game even though my mind was reeling trying to effectively plan the placement/removal of my workers.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I have been wanting to play this one for a while since I really like Glory to Rome.
Personally I found this to be a far cry from GtR; in my opinion all of the tension and interesting card synergies are missing.
The locations are all very lackluster and are just worth 1, 2 or 3 points with very generic powers.
The worst part of the game is how poorly the theme is tied into the game. 
Dinosaurs, awesome... except none of the theme comes through with any of the cards. 

[i]This game was another disappointment and not something I would seek out to play again.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Via Appia[/COLOR] was traded away in a math trade 5/15/14 with Drizzt. (Received 1775:Rebellion)

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]My initial thought were pretty accurate, this is a beautifully produced game with some strategy. After multiple plays the game felt very samey and eventually the rock crushing mechanic was not enough of a draw to get this one to the table. Via Appia also suffers from a similar problem as Kingsburg; about 3/4 of the way through the game you pretty much know who is going to win. There are not enough hidden points in the game to add much doubt as to who is going to win. Add to the fact that it really doesn&#039;t play well with 2 and this game ended up languishing on our shelves for a while before I traded it.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]First of all this is a beautifully produced game, everything is top notch. The rock &quot;crushing&quot; part of the game is the highlight, the rest of the game is okay.
There is some light strategy in this game. This game plays best with 3 or 4, I would not recommend it as a 2p game (there seems to be a runaway leader problem.)

Overall I would recommend this game to families looking for a light weight game everyone will enjoy. I think this game would work well with younger children (I would say 6+).[/i]</comment>				</item>

Traded away in a math trade 3/17/15. (Received Eclipse)

Highlights:
- Plays great with 2 and is a great family game.
- Tile laying: one of my favorite mechanics in games especially when it is not the [i]only[/i] mechanic.
- The market wheel: Innovative mechanic that determines how much a certain tile/veeple set is going to cost. 
[i]This creates a lot of tense moments when you try to determine whether you can wait one more round to get the tile/veeple you need for a lower price.[/i]
- Bonus tiles add more strategy to the game without adding a lot of new rules or added complexity.</comment>				</item>

- A worker placement game that also is a race to [i]x[/i] number of victory points, awesome because you really have no time to waste.
- Theme, I love wine and instantly felt immersed in the theme of this game.
- Played really well with 2, the game still felt tight and spaces were hotly contested.
- Optimization, I love building and optimizing an engine to generate a commodity which is then converted into money or points.
- I appreciate any wp game that allows you to select a space someone else already chose [i](in this game you have one &quot;large&quot; worker that can share a space with another worker)[/i].

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- An excellent head to head 2p game that was also quite fun as a 3p free for all match.
- The superhero theme shines through, the character abilities fit each of the different characters (Hulk&#039;s my favorite).
- There is a ton of variety in this game starting with the possible main characters you can play, the supporting characters, plot twists and then each group of heroes are different from one another (the base game includes the X-men, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and Villains).
- Deck building is not usually my thing, but it is really easy to tweak your decks especially since we want to limit each deck to one affiliation.
- Set up is a breeze compared to a game like Marvel Legendary.

This game has become a huge hit with my son and my daughter can&#039;t wait to play. I have a feeling this will fill two holes in our collection, both Summoner Wars (a 2+ player fighting game) and Marvel Legendary (a thematic superhero game). This game wasn&#039;t even on my radar, but I had an opportunity to play with one of the designers (who I meet through another friend) and had a blast. This game offers everything I wanted out of a superhero game, head to head battles instead of a semi co-op game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

Highlights:
- Fast, fun filler game that you can teach anyone in 60 seconds (And most of our games lasted 10 minutes or less).
- Pre-programmed movement, but you are setting up 3 moves at a time. By the time you get to your third move you may end up running right of the plank and meet your untimely demise.
- The artwork is really good with nice components and pirate meeples.
- This game is funny; it is hard not to laugh at the chaos that unfolds as the game progresses.

- A quick, extremely tight worker placement game.
- Tile laying; you are building out your land which will determine which goods you can harvest each round.
- Having to work your way around town without being able to back track forces you to plan multiple moves in advance.
- The random season disc really forces you to think on your feet because you never know what the feeding/heating situation will be.

Initial thoughts and rating (10):

[i]- Excellent family game that plays great with 2, [i](although the game doesn&#039;t feel as cut throat compared to a 3p or 4p game)[/i]. 
- Great artwork, it is very clean, and beautiful components especially the glossy tiles and the bowls used to hold your wasabi cubes.
- Very simple rule set which makes this game a breeze to teach while still offering plenty of depth and strategy.
- Tile laying with a lot of great player interaction, especially with the bonus cards.
- The bonus cards give you the opportunity to manipulate the board state in different ways.
- Recipe management; you can work on three recipes at a time, but you choose from 2, 3, 4 and 5 ingredient recipes. [i]Completing smaller recipes will earn you power cards quickly while the bigger recipes offer much better scoring opportunities.[/i]
- Wasabi cubes, completing recipes &quot;in style&quot; [i](ingredients placed in the order shown on the recipe card)[/i] will earn you bonus points in the form of wasabi cubes (and serve as the tie breaker).[/i]
</comment>	<conditiontext>Condition: Very good, the box does show some minor shelf wear. All of the game pieces are in great shape.

Edition: Z-Man games, I believe first edition [i](not sure how to tell)[/i]</conditiontext>			</item>

- Awesome family filler game that my kids really enjoyed. 
- Everyone in my gaming group also enjoyed it when they played.
- Great bits (namely the plastic animals) that my kids loved.
- Another Knizia with a great scoring system; trying to time when to play your high value cards before the game ends while not giving someone else the opportunity to play a low number.
- In essence this is a stock market manipulation game. You can take any animal you want, no matter what animal card you played which allows you to hedge your bets.

[i]I immediately added this to my wishlist and then found out they are changing the name which in my opinion is awful (from Botswana to Wildlife Safari). I hope I can find a copy of Botswana for a reasonable price.[/i]</comment>				</item>

- The theme/historical basis of this game shines through. 
[i]This game is a perfect vehicle point for getting kids to become interested in the history of East and West Germany and how it impacted the rest of the world. [/i]
- The game play is extremely smooth and intuitive. It will take a few plays to remember how the end of decade scoring works, but everything happening not only makes sense, it also ties in perfectly with the theme. 
- Multi-use cards (which usually have an alignment to one of the two sides), each card functions in multiple ways and the decision of how to use each card really makes you think about your long term strategy [i](usually based on what your opponent is doing)[/i]. 
- A shared card pool, each turn you are selecting a card to play from a shared row. This creates some wonderful tension as you way the benefits of a card that will help you, versus leaving a card you know will be a boon to your opponent.
- It&#039;s fun! Seriously, a game like this could crumble under it&#039;s own weight but Wir... manages to keep the game play snappy and the rules overhead low creating a really snappy, fun play experience. 

[i]There are many more things I could say about Wir... but really you need to play this game to really appreciate what a brilliant design it is. Kudos to the designers Richard Sivél and Peer Sylvester for creating such an elegant game.
I&#039;m really looking forward to getting in more plays of this brilliant game.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>[i]- Nice dice with great artwork on them. 
My only complaint is that it is not easy to tell the difference between the white and cream colored dice.
- Turns are quick; plus you are always engaged since you can fill orders when it is someone else&#039;s turn.
- While there are not a lot of decisions to be made during the game, there is a nice push your luck element when deciding whether or not to score a card.
- The fact that you can sell at anytime allows you to sell one card and then start the next one with the same pool of dice keep the game moving.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>player powers. I especially liked the addition of adding money to the wanted posters which you will then collect during the scoring phase depending on the melds you have versus just playing melds in front of you for points. I also really enjoyed the theme, this was a very pleasant surprise.

[i]I am looking forward to playing this again, I would definitely like to try it with more than 2 to see how it changes the game. However; if I was going to add a Mike Fitzgerald card game to my collection I think I would go with [thing=151022][/thing].[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I enjoyed my play of this game, but it is not a game I feel the need to seek out.
Drafting from the dice pool was fun, but the choices you had to make seemed to be obvious most of the time.
Most of the &quot;difficult&quot; decisions came when you were the one who rolled the dice and therefore got to choose first.

Overall I had fun, the game played quick and had enough light decisions to make it interesting.
I think this would make a great, light family game that introduces some different game mechanics in a very easy to learn manner.</comment>				</item>

Received in a trade(6/22/14). 
I traded away Cockroach Poker, Haggis and Legendary Fantastic 4. 

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]This game started off strong, but after the initial 3 plays my daughter was really the only one interested in playing. We tried it with 2, but it fell flat. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it with 2 players, I think you need at least 3 to make it interesting and it&#039;s best with 4. 

I really enjoyed pulling the animals out of the bag, placing them in the trucks and having to decide when to grab that truck versus pushing your luck for one more turn. However; after that the game got kind of boring. Placing your animals wasn&#039;t that exciting and I hated how artificial it felt to build the carts in your park since they only gave you points based on a set collection mechanic. We also have Zooloretto Dice and it is one instance were I think the pared down version of a game is much better.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]The dice game plays much quicker, plays well with 2, still has beautiful components and manages to capture the feel of it&#039;s big brother (especially the tension in deciding how to split up your animals in the trucks and when to take a truck versus pushing your luck and rolling more dice). 
Highlights:
- Theme really comes through because of the art/production.
- Awesome family game that plays well with 3 and 4, haven&#039;t tried a 2p game yet.
- Simple mechanics that work well together and still offer some difficult choices to make each turn.
- Filling the trucks with animals: this is the meat of the game to me, when do you take a truck and when do you push your luck and hope to draw another animal you really need. Of course then someone else can snatch that truck from you.
- Coins: they help you have more control over your zoo and move animals around or buy them from other peoples barns.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>19</numplays>			<comment>[COLOR=#FF0000]Zooloretto: The Dice Game[/COLOR] was sold via auction...

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]I picked this up for my daughter at Total Con and I have actually come to enjoy the game more now than when I first picked it up. This is definitely a direct result of my having picked up Zooloretto over the summer and playing that. I thought Zooloretto dragged on for what it was and the dice version condensed the game down to my favorite part - loading and taking trucks. Zooloretto dice packs in all the tension/push your luck of deciding when to chance rolling the dice again versus taking a truck that will help you and packs it into a quick playing dice filler. 

However; after a bunch of plays the game has wore out it&#039;s welcome and started to feel very samey. It was fun while it lasted, but there just isn&#039;t enough variety game to game to merit it&#039;s staying in our collection.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (8):

[i]- My daughter loves it, especially the theme.
- The dice are beautiful (really nice animal silhouettes engraved into the wooden dice).
- The score sheets are in full color with some nice art. This helps get the theme across.
- Quick, fun family game that younger children could easily play.
- However; there is some strategy involved with placing dice in the trucks and deciding when to stop rolling and pick animals.
- This is a very well designed, light filler game.

I highly recommend this game for kids, it is a game they could easily teach to their friends and play on their own. After owning/playing Zooloretto I would rather play this version and traded away my copy of Zooloretto.[/i]</comment>				</item>
