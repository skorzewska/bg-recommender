	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A great shorter implementation of Twilight. I think it has a perfect theme as politics is really much akin to war.

Update:

Many have commented that this game is inferior to it&#039;s original due to some &quot;tug of war&quot; that occurs over given territories.

I&#039;m confused why someone would allow themselves to be sucked into a fruitless contest such as this rather than focus efforts elsewhere. I&#039;m of the opinion that this is an artifact of group think.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Certainly this game will not appeal to everyone. It even takes a few plays before you know the types of things you have to do to get points. Further, it helps knowing your fellow players well so when they have their turn as high priestess you can have a inkling as to their possible choices.

Update:

With newer releases for larger groups, this game has lost most of what was appealing. That doesn&#039;t mean I will get rid of it, nor does it mean that it&#039;s a bad game; it has just been eclipsed by designs that have more creative freedom, more interaction between all players, or a shorter play time.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>While some would compare this to RftG, the only points in common are the wealth of symbols to learn the meaning of, and decipher the best decisions to make with the actions available.

This game is hand management, tableau building, worker placement, and an agonizing choice mechanism that really boils down to three primary actions.

Difficult to learn, even more difficult to master, but a joy to play.

I have to start off by saying that I don&#039;t think that I care for this game with 6 or 7 at all. It simply takes most players too long to make their decisions for a game this light. 

I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;ll say it again; this is an upgraded Fairy Tale and that&#039;s a high compliment in my world.

A game like this should be played fast and dirty. You can always play again or even several times in a row.

Update:

More plays and I&#039;m still interested in exploring the game space more. There certainly are strategies at hand here. We always make sure that the purple/bonus cards that are being used are fully revealed and explained to allow for some long term strategy and planning.

My only real frustration is that often you lose by mere points through no fault of your own. It&#039;s still short, fast, and interesting. Certainly a fine replacement for Fairy Tale of which we have played far too much.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Definitely purchase.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>If this game were just worker placement, it would be mediocre at best. However, it&#039;s the storytelling that really sells the system. While it&#039;s not as deep in terms of choices in a game like Arabian or Smersh, it does require some risk to get your rewards, which makes you play differently and choose what you build differently.

Of course, it also has Ryan&#039;s amazing art, which is always easy on the eyes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Don&#039;t let others fool you:

This isn&#039;t Settlers even though you gather resources and spend them in a similar manner.

This isn&#039;t Race just because there&#039;s roles for action selection.

The way that this game uses a chart of 12-15 action cards (3-4 per player based on number of players), executing them in order yet applied to the queue by player choice, is a crucial element that changes the entire formula. Given that phases can happen multiple times during a round makes the strategy of the order of your own actions coupled with the guessing game of what others will do even more tense and engaging.

First play was almost 2 hours including explanation. This one needs a much better player aid than what was provided to lower the boundary to entry.

Solid and worth playing again; certainly a 60 minute game AT BEST.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>As long as we can bring this one down in play time, I&#039;m certain I can continue to have the love affair I enjoy with it. I can certainly say that it didn&#039;t feel 3.5 hours long, and it was totally engaging. There are some possibilities for AP issues, as well as &quot;dud&quot; turns where there are no dice that are worthwhile for you to use, in a way; though this is exceptionally rare and minor.

I love that like Cleopatra, there is a total loss condition in the game. I also like that you have the option for playing against the game and/or the other players. I wish the objectives had slightly higher values to make non combat options more viable, but I supposed since it&#039;s a Conan game, it makes sense for it to be about fighting.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is by far the best design to come out of the &quot;Drover&quot; line.

The board is a bit too large, but then again, presentation does make this game stand out.

Fantastic bits, wonderfully clear rules (they give a brief overview then a detailed description, and even have an advanced variant for starting position), and a collection of familiar mechanics masterfully blended into what makes a fantastic game.

So many avenues to victory, and a wealth of synergy makes this one almost a 10...but more plays will prove that.

Update:

This one settles at a solid 7. In time other designs have appeared which do similar things either better or in a shorter play time. This game still does some unique things on it&#039;s own and the worker placement style is still not totally usurped. It certainly retains it&#039;s spot in my collection.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Welcome to a world that is a more straight forward, simpler, Brass.

The choices are simpler. That makes the game tighter. 

The choices are still not obvious. That makes it an equally challenging, yet fairly different experience.

I&#039;m curious as to how this will play with 5. If it delivers with 5 like it did with 3 then this is my  go-to Brass for 5. I&#039;m fairly certain that with a more hardcore group, and of course 3-4 players, I would still prefer the more harsh and unforgiving original formula.

First play was with 3, second with 4. It seems the more the merrier, however I still have to play with 5. 

Further, I have now played with both sides of the board and found both wonderfully different and worthwhile. I think the German side is more like Brass sans ships while the New England side is more game changing, especially with respect to coal.

People have stated that rails are less important. I whole heartedly disagree.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Even better than I had expected. 1 play = 9, after subsequent plays I am thinking more of a 9.5 or 10.

After repeated plays it&#039;s definately a solid 9, though I tend to think it deserves higher; however, it is such a gamer&#039;s game that it might not ever make it to a 10.

Update: Yep, I was right. Make it a 10.</comment>				</item>

The Atlantis map intentionally makes the game so hard that it&#039;s no fun. You struggle against the system and not the other players. 

I wish there were something on the other side of the Triland map to make this worth the money.</comment>				</item>

The WW2 era spy theme oozes throughout, the stories are captivating, and you don&#039;t even care whether you win or lose, it&#039;s just that fun.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Kickstarted Due Feb 2015</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Think of it as Harvest Moon the board game with 3 levels of complexity, and a ridiculous of occupations (other than just being a farmer).

I say complexity, but the game does not get more complex with the I deck (and I doubt with the k either), and only serves to make it a deeper, richer experience. Also note that the change of deck type also does not lengthen the game.

It does play in about 30 minutes per player, and feels only a fraction of that. This game is simply brilliant.</comment>	<conditiontext>Update:

My rating is based on 3 plays, and the opinions of everyone else who played it at my house recently. Everyone loves it, and thinks as highly of it as any other game they might call their favorite. Many even said they prefer it to Power Grid or Puerto Rico. I personally simply make it a 10, as it&#039;s complexity, diversity, synergy based gameplay, and incredible tension make for one of the best games I have ever played. It&#039;s already been requested for our next session. I&#039;m even buying an english copy....and when I let that cat out of the bag everyone discussed being able to play to games at once!!! The proof&#039;s in the pudding.\

Update: Now at 11 plays...long past when &quot;hype&quot; would spur me on. I&#039;ve played with all three decks multiple times, and I think I is my favorite, though now I would play with any of the three.

20 plays. Believe the hype.

Over 50 plays, still loving it. Still finding new ways to play.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Gives the base game all new legs (as if it needed them), adds another layer of complexity and shakes up the turn order quite a bit.

Not something I would play all of the time, but will see play semi regularly.</comment>				</item>

First, is it odd that this reminds me of Attika?

You can gain resources or move &amp; build. You can build or upgrade one building in a region. Other people with higher level building get a piece of the resources you paid to build or upgrade. Your goal is to build and then upgrade all 3 of your cities to level 4.

2 plays with 3 and 4 so far with equal tension and competition. Victory was achieved in a different manner each time.

Wrede made another good game that I&#039;m certain will be as overlooked as Pompeii.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Among the Stars felt like a mess. Much like Briefcase&#039;s take on deck building, AtS tries to combine drafting with tableau construction, and in my eyes fails.

The problem is that so many of the cards are situational. Often a card that would give 2-3 points would be 4 or more if you had gotten it sooner or later in the game. Indeed, you never feel like you&#039;re guiding your own destiny, but are just along for the ride.

I guess its fine for some, just to play along and see how things turn out, but even 7 Wonders (which I&#039;m also not a gigantic fan of) makes you feel like your choices matter.

There&#039;s also no gauge for how well you&#039;re doing until the very end. Our first game had an early runaway leader. Everyone caught up and things seem balanced, then the end game saw a 20 point blowout which no one could quite understand. Underwhelming is the word I would use.

I&#039;d also add that the game&#039;s art is really ugly. </comment>				</item>

Update:

Years later and this still gets played at least a few times a year. The bidding system that we now see in Vegas Showdown, Homesteaders, and even Peloponnes started here; but in a harsher twist in the &quot;cannot bid in the same location once outbid&quot;.

The more the merrier but I&#039;ve never been totally convinced that you have to play with max players for this to be a good game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The look and feel of this game is just wonderful to me. I look at the box, then when I take everything out, the theme continues. Ryan is a great artist, that&#039;s for sure.

As for the game? It&#039;s a solid worker placement with a nice twist to semi-restrict your placements. The restrictions force you to play in different ways rather than just be left out of certain actions. Almost everything is useful, and because of that, it&#039;s easy to forget your main objective: collecting banners. 

The game is so tight, and it feels like there&#039;s never enough time to do what you want, and that is the sweet spot for a game like this. Too much freedom and you have a hollow experience. So far everyone has wanted to play again and again.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Kickstarted - Due December 2014</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Solid 8. I&#039;m not sure that the rating could ever go higher for several reasons including:

- This game can be played by 5 players, but I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d ever want to. Time is the major factor here that even though there are a fixed number of rounds, it&#039;s still quite long. 3-4 is a great number for this game, and it scales amazingly well.

- There&#039;s a ton of fiddle here. I love the system and the theme so I don&#039;t mind that much, but the setup is 10x more arduous than the breakdown.

- The learning curve for a game of this length is VERY steep. So steep that they had to have strategy primers in the box (which I&#039;m quite thankful for). Still, it makes new players start at a distinct disadvantage; and given the amount of screwage that you can inflict that could certainly be a factor to discourage repeat plays by newcomers.

It&#039;s a great game with quite a number of ways to play, and then there are &quot;mini-games&quot; that have to be managed within each character.  Once we got the kinks out our 3rd play was smooth, fun, involving, challenging, tense, suspenseful, and satisfying.

One final note is that I was surprised at how balanced all the point strategies in the game are; meaning that there is a bonus as well as a foil for every point system in the game. The conspiracy puzzle can benefit early adopters and late comers equally as well.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Netrunner is one of those special games where the play and player interaction outshines the actual system. The core game is a 9, but because players can play the game well and win rather than just build well and win speaks volumes.

I&#039;m at 60 plays and never looking back. In a way it&#039;s good that Netrunner failed in the early days because I think the time for things to simmer, ideas about card games to evolve, and players to mature as, well, players, makes now the right time for it to re-emerge. That it is not collectible is simply the cherry on top.</comment>				</item>

First: This is the worst artwork I&#039;ve seen since the cover of Roads and Boats; and I didn&#039;t have to stare at that art the entire game :(

The game is very abstract and takes quite a while for everyone to build up meaningful levels of action ability. To compound this the most interesting parts of the game happen in the last 15 minutes, after playing nearly an hour.

Finally, the scoring is so tight that things could go in any direction at any given moment. 

While I love the idea of building your hill for actions and the ability to play with the triggering of the anteaters I just cannot like this game as much as I&#039;d like to.

Off the wishlist it comes :(</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Curious use of Java and Taluva building in which # of levels high = number of times you do a selected action.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The Rondel (the way you choose your action each turn) is a beautiful mechanism. The game&#039;s combat is moderate, and quitre comparable in feel to Wallenstein, but with absolutely no luck; actually there&#039;s no luck at all in this game. 

The fact that this game has more wood than any other that I own, coupled with the fact that it has 2 maps right out of the box, makes this one a winner; and I have to believe that my rating will rise with more players. This game has tremendous tension, and that will certainly be bolstered with more players involved.

If you can get you hands on this one, it&#039;s well worth it.

Update: With the advent of other Rondel based games this one drops a point.

Update 2: More plays in recent times. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because we&#039;ve played so many more games now, or if the experience at this particular game has contributed to better play, but this one returns to an 8. 

Update 3:

This game can suffer from new players versus experienced players. The advancements have to be equally gained first in order for equal play else there can be a runaway leader. That being said, I think the game is certainly all about the advancements and lacks the diversity in paths to victory that later rondel games have.</comment>				</item>

Pollution and famine are two of the most interesting mechanics of any game, and force you to balance all the actions you take. 

I&#039;m not so sure how balanced all of the win conditions are, but I am certain that over time we will see that they are more equal than they first appear.

Played again. This game will hurt your brain, but it never feels as long as it is. I have to concede that Larry Levy was right: I don&#039;t think you would use Pollution or Famine for a new players first game, but after the first play I wouldn&#039;t play without it.

Update: 

Many more plays. Still heavy. Still brain melty. Still a 10.</comment>				</item>

The game is initially visually overwhelming, and certainly brings out the AP even in the best of us. It&#039;s colorful and fun, and for me the submarine/bot scoring mechanism really has a feel of Terra Mystica, so I think that lends to my love of the game.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I guess I can see why Rio sat on this game for so long: It&#039;s not as light or as easy to learn as Dominion. The sad part is, it has some other things going on rather than just building your engine, such as the bidding at the end of each round of play. The digging is also a nice variable that, while it can harm a player&#039;s progress a bit, does add another element to the whole, making the package much more appealing in ways.

I actually think I would have liked it more if this wasn&#039;t my 12th deck builder or so; not that I&#039;m tired of them honestly, I&#039;ve just seen such a variety now that this is simply average rather than the fresh and unique it would have been years ago.</comment>				</item>

I dunno, after playing Hive it&#039;s obvious that it was intended to make a multiplayer version that was simple and fast to play, but it just seems like there&#039;s no way to truely strategize. After my first plays I found that someone is always giving the win away unless they get lucky. 

It needs a few more plays as I see glimmers of truth peeking out; I also love bakelite.</comment>	<conditiontext>Like New: For Trade or Best Cash Offer</conditiontext>			</item>

- Multiple buys allowed in a round
- Multiple combats allowed in a round
- Randomized row of six cards available for purchase
- 3 Standard cards always available
- Row refills immediately following combat and purchases

It&#039;s much less predictable and strategic than Dominion but plays with the same light feel and fast pace. It also remains VERY COMBOLICIOUS.

I&#039;ll be excited to see where they take this system next.</comment>				</item>

The powers are over the top, the combat is in your face, fighting favors the attacker (especially since you can go berzerk), and the goals are set up so you can strategize and complete them without giving too much information about your plans away.

I also love the theme and how well integrated it is. The wait has been worth it.</comment>				</item>

Take a factionless game, add smaller decks, short play, and you&#039;re almost there. Add a dice-based resource system that lets you completely manipulate it at any time, and you complete it.

First, Ms Suarez, I&#039;m in LOVE. You&#039;re one hell of an artist, and you have my attention; well even more than DoW, but now I&#039;m fully locked in. Something like this needs to be captivating, and you&#039;ve made women everywhere happy with 4 of the 6 Phoenixborns completely powerful, but not over sexualized, women. BRAVO. 

So the system is rounds of back and forth actions until each passes. You play stuff, you attack with stuff, etc. I know it sounds mundane, but factor in the ability to manipulate your dice, however, your deck is so-very-finite at a scant 30 cards. It&#039;s amazing how much play can be had in a tiny deck size. The modes of play are here too; the draft is dead brilliant.

If you get the chance, play a demo. If you like lcgish games, you&#039;ll likely fall for this one. It&#039;ll even fit in to your economy with a slower release schedule. I have a feeling releases, though fewer, will have more value since every card is meaningful to any build. There is no chaff in this game, and no limits.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Assyria is a game that has quite a bit going for it. There&#039;s a bit of area control, there&#039;s a building aspect, and some majority play.

The only fuzzy area for me is that of the card display. It&#039;s a random element that is awfully rogue. It can often spoil your plans and sour your attitude. It&#039;s feast or famine and nary in between.

While the cards can dash your hopes you can often refocus on other avenues to build VP&#039;s but ultimately the cards dictate your camel gathering performance, which is a key to victory.

There&#039;s obvious strategy here with a splash of tactical play to be had. I think repeated play will allow the cards to be overcome but time will tell.</comment>				</item>

What you mainly have is Antiquity distilled down to it&#039;s essence. While it might be perceived to be too long for what it is, I actually quite like it&#039;s similarity to the latter, while appreciating it&#039;s differences, which are more like the designer&#039;s other work.

There&#039;s quite a bit to learn, but it remains simpler and shorter than the rest of the trilogy.

It&#039;s the first design, but I&#039;m glad it was released last, and further I&#039;m happy that there promises more to come from this blossoming designer.</comment>				</item>

Uses a twist on Cartagena movement and an interesting evolution of the card draw mechanism from Cartagena.

All in all a fine game that I look forward to playing more.

It&#039;s a fine design, and it&#039;s a bit light, with a dose of luck. 

We used the variant of face up draw piles, and included the windmill, so it was as &quot;good as it gets&quot;.

It could be worth playing again, but I wasn&#039;t too excited by it, and it may make an exit stage left...we&#039;ll see; perhaps another play is in order.</comment>				</item>

Automobile takes basically a marginal gains system and an incrementally more expensive cost track and makes a serious brain burner of a game.

Plays in 90 minutes and while I like it better with 4 than 3, I personally think the game would suffer, at least for one person, with 5; unless you like high screwage. I would wager in a 5p game one person knows half way in that they have lost.

Well there are enough points, but use them wisely, or your first game will end up like ours....with none of us finishing!

That being said, this game makes for a tight, strategic race, that&#039;s one part fun, one part screw your buddy.

This one is going up for trade/sell.</comment>	<conditiontext>Like New: For Trade or Best Cash Offer</conditiontext>			</item>

It helps a ton if you&#039;re a fan of the movies.

It also helps to play with 4 or less and the game ends in a blistering 20 minute flash.</comment>				</item>

Round cards suck.

Munchkin style box sucks.

Amusing for kids, not necessary if you have the original.</comment>				</item>

There&#039;s alot of &quot;tit for tat&quot; card play in this one, though picking your battles and trying to bluff/goad your opponent into ones that are unimportant to you to mask your true intent is the heart of this game. </comment>				</item>

For my time and money I&#039;d just rather play Chaos in the Old World. It&#039;s a shame too, because Chaos could easily have been re-themed to this and though the same would have been a MUCH better game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is certainly not the war game that the box might fool you into believing. It&#039;s a majorities game, and quite an abstract one.

Essentially you&#039;re trying to get majorities at vertices, and then the most controlled vertices controls the towers for vps. The major twist is that there are 10 bonus tokens of various powers to modify play. 

It&#039;s a fun romp, and it&#039;s pleasing to the eye as well.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s exactly what it looks like, though it&#039;s surprising how much the texture of the table and the coefficient of drag both on the coasters and boundary line comes into the strategy.

Fantastic little game. Came with Ted&#039;s map pack, the 6th player expansion, and ended at $15 free ship; a bargain!</comment>				</item>

Update:

Kicked to the curb by Mansions of Madness. While I know Betrayal isn&#039;t moderated it&#039;s still a one versus many concept that delivers the same feel and the Mythos we know and love.</comment>	<conditiontext>Gently Used: For Trade or Best Cash Offer</conditiontext>			</item>

Update: Would you look at that? More plays and it&#039;s a 9! I like the balance of hand management versus the timing of the buildings. With experienced players it can seem like someone has an unfair lead, and a timely play puts you with them or out in front. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>Fantastic NON-Colectible card game. Tons of strategy under what had appeared at first glance to be a stripped down exterior.

All the good stuff I liked about ccgs, without almost any of the stuff I didn&#039;t. Add to that fantastic balancing, high production values, and wonderful art direction. 

Some of the names are a bit unpronouncable and some of the others are groan inducingly comical as well as down right awful. Though if that&#039;s the game&#039;s only shortcoming, I see no shortcomings.

 While I also wish I could find card sleeves for the oversized cards, I wouldn&#039;t wish the cards to be smaller just to accomodate
being able to protect them. 

The Vulca and Mimix are wonderful decks, though it is not necessary to buy the base set, as all other decks can work independantly, given you already know the rules and can produce 3 proxies for the dragons.

It is worth it to buy all the decks, as you can then play the &quot;Consolidated&quot; versions fo each deck, by returning the scattered cards of other races from the base deck they are in, over to the race deck the &quot;belong&quot; in.

Deckbuilding with the Emissaries and Inquisitors packs should be something very fun when I get around to it.

I highly recommend this game to anyone.

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>A nice game of majorities, hand management, and planned movement. I really love the idea of previously scored tiles adding a bonus to orthagnally adjacent tiles when they are scored. The game is elegantly simple in it&#039;s design, and it&#039;s fast paced with tons of room for strategy. The card luck can be a factor, albiet a minor one.</comment>				</item>

The crux of my rating is based on the guessing game that is worker placement. While you do have a range of possibilities to help you narrow down your guess there still seems to be too wide a &quot;margin of error&quot; to allow for consistent strategy.</comment>				</item>

Update: 

Still sees occasional play. I still feel that this game doesn&#039;t play well with more than 5. One crucial lesson through the years is that one play can give away the farm, and indeed the game, becoming an unintentional king maker.</comment>				</item>

Quite a fine family game. Especially good with large groups. It&#039;s alot of randomness, but it&#039;s quite alot of silly fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Over my initial play I really came to appreciate this system. The early going can be akin to stabbing in the dark, and indeed even some turns almost require a bit of blind faith that your preparations will be useful, there&#039;s the other side of things where the lack of player interaction actually serves to reduce the chances of screwage.

I do think experience will prove that you can predictively play and make wise decisions, and certainly the play time is so short that even the random elements do not hurt so bad.

In the end you have a game that&#039;s unique, fun, and fast. I&#039;m looking forward to many more plays.</comment>				</item>

There&#039;s an odd mish-mash of play and tactics found here. On one hand, you&#039;re trying to get certain firemen to the top to get the most points with your hand...but you have to use their cards to do so. On the other side of things pairs of ones are valuable so you don&#039;t want to use them...and ones might be all you have for a color. There&#039;s also the fact that someone might have a massive amount of one color and be able to get gigantic points..I also find it disturbing that so far, in almost 10 games of this, no one has score negative points...

This game is at the same level as Dragon Parade, only with a tactic more.

I&#039;ve had fun with it, but I wonder how soon it might wear thin.</comment>	<conditiontext>Like New: For Trade or Best Cash Offer</conditiontext>			</item>

It’s incredibly abstract, quite engaging, very tense, and a little too long. It can take some time to build up steam and luck of the draw still has a large impact regardless of the 5 tile display.

Perhaps if this had come earlier in my gaming career it would have been more fascinating and garnered a higher rating, however it’s not the lack of merit the game earns but rather the sheer amount of competition for time it has these days.

Perhaps one day it will see play again, but that wouldn’t keep me from trading this game away.

I like the bluffing in this game as well, and we did not utilize it enough in our firt plays.</comment>				</item>

Update:

The more the system is expanded and the more it evolves the better it gets. It&#039;s still one of the best of all time.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Solid meld of TTR and a hint of AoS. 

The issue is that it certainly doesn&#039;t play in the 60-90 range without multiple plays, and even then does it stack up well enough against games of that length that I would still want to play.

I see this getting a few more plays to find that out as it&#039;s a solid design, a good effort and play might sweeten with experience and reduced duration.</comment>				</item>

I also liked the addition of a fifth player. The game scaled well before, and continues to do so, though I will say that with that many players you can expect the full 120 minutes that the box advertises; though I would play with 5 any time.</comment>				</item>

Played quickly this is a light fun game that should survive at least a dozen plays. Perhaps it will inspire us to play more but I somehow doubt it&#039;s welcome will wear so well.

One final note: I wish Klaus had relied on his name to sell this one. I guess after the poor reception Pompeii received he felt he needed to attach the moniker to see it even though it was entirely unrelated to the original; just like Mr. Friese.</comment>				</item>

I was shocked at how much I liked it. It&#039;s not amazing by any stretch but it certainly has it&#039;s own place and time. I&#039;m looking forward to more plays.</comment>				</item>

There&#039;s the main area where you build, gain multipliers for your income and or points, as well as potentially screw your opponents income.

Then there&#039;s the matter of the characters that determine turn order for the round with variable powers; tack onto that that they are chosen in ascending passing order from the previous round.

It&#039;s all tense, diverse, and quite fun.

I will say however that the dice can be a little unforgiving, though this can be mitigated and perhaps avoided altogether with the variant. I also do not think this game is as good with 5.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Short. Simple. 

There are so few strategies in this game that once you begin to dominate one you&#039;ve got a huge advantage. Get your foot in the door to what seems to be the only other strategy, and you&#039;ve got a lock.

So let me get this straight: There&#039;s the tower strategy, house strategy, the &quot;hope people don&#039;t place too many  helpers&quot; strategy, and the &quot;please god don&#039;t let people build too many buildings&quot; strategy.

It&#039;s a total dud. Some of the bonuses simply don&#039;t pay enough. I mean, who exactly isn&#039;t going to try and play as many helpers as they can or build as many buildings as they can? Perhaps they&#039;re trying not to help people using those strategies, but then what are they to do?

I was a runaway leader when playing this and I can honestly say that 3 experienced players were left with a game that was not even as good as Stone Age. 

I know they&#039;re going for family style games these days but this one needed to bake a bit longer in the over before they served it up.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This one really takes the right group. 

There&#039;s a smattering of inductive reasoning coupled with he blind guessing/attacking of Shadow Hunters and Werewolf.

At one point the facts are on the table and it&#039;s a mad scramble for someone to end the game.

Expect an uneven reception to this one.

Update:

Sloppy and un-fun. There are too many newer games of this style, especially The Resistance, that have really honed this style to a razor&#039;s edge with equal simplicity.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;m concerned that Castles is likely best with 4 given that every tile appears in a 4P game and that there are more available tiles vs player actions leading to each round being 5 turns of great choices not 3 or MAYBE 4 with good choices. I still had a fun time with the 3P experience but there&#039;s something to be said for the full player count.

I&#039;m also highly motivated to use the alternative player boards as I think there will be less player collisions based simply on equal desire from a static setup. I think the tension would be even higher, the games more varied, and the competition more fierce at times when the variable boards create uneven levels of demand.

I think it&#039;s Feld&#039;s best game with In the Year of the Dragon being a very close second.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Obvious statement of the year: This game is a very close cousin to Suburbia.

I actually find the theme much more engaging than Burb. I also find it, mostly, less chaotic. Smart plays and wise master builder turns can lead to advantage, even if you&#039;re not doing well with bonuses. 

What a great evolution of the system.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Definately a different direction for the Catan franchise. The game does have limited trading, and the first play through is on the long side (though it doesn&#039;t feel that way). I know with experience that this game can be played in much less than the 90 minutes it&#039;s rated for.

It&#039;s a good game; but not great; but definitely worth playing many times to come.

Update:

As our gaming experience has grown so too has that allowed us to see more bad than good here. It lasted less than 10 plays before the trade.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>For me this is like Agricola only it has more freedom like you&#039;d find in many resource conversion games such as Homesteaders. That&#039;s a double edged sword because as much as the system opens up it also takes away the uniqueness.

This game is certainly one big pond to swim in. I&#039;m sure some Gric purists will poo-poo this game, perhaps others will simply be tired of the genre, however for anyone like me that still enjoys a cube churner with lots of flavor and freedom, then this game will hit all the right notes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Such a variety of avenues to victory....even when the game is tight, there are many, many options. 

First came Ys from Ystari, which was a 9...with it&#039;s expansion it became a 10.

I was never surprised that their next release would be even better. I expect great things in Ystari&#039;s future.

Superb production values and graphic design are a hallmark of this company and it&#039;s games. If you are looking for a short game, or a filler, they have nothing to offer you. If you are looking for a deep gamer&#039;s game, welcome home.

Update:

Pending another play, this might drop as far as a 8. The mechanics are brilliant, and I really want to love this game, but I suppose maybe I just don&#039;t get it.

Either way, I&#039;ll play again and we&#039;ll see.

Update:

More plays, more effort, more paying attention to the people beating me silly finally gave me my light bulb moment. It&#039;s as good as I ever thought.</comment>				</item>

Update: After the lore of the chrome has worn off, it&#039;s easy to see that this is not all that great of a game. It&#039;s in the same boat of many rock paper scissors games, and while it is thankfully short, it doesn&#039;t feel all that satisfying; thus it is beginning to gather dust.</comment>	<conditiontext>Like New: For Trade or Best Cash Offer</conditiontext>			</item>

The new Skaven faction is well done and compliments the game nicely.

Overall I&#039;m wondering if they could have just waited an extra year or two and released the game with this &quot;expansion&quot; in a complete form. 

The 5th player does make the game longer but it&#039;s incredibly tense and our initial plays have been quite close.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The game has alot of bits, but overall isn&#039;t all that fiddly. I though for sure that setup and breakdown time would take a while, but even before the first play it took only minutes; and even less time with subsequent plays.

I like the &quot;layering&quot; of the board. It gives a 3d feel that most games cannot relay. I understand that this is a trademark of Zoch games, and this is no exception. From the Mouse shaped tokens, to the holes in the insert that act as the Dungeon to the castle, this game screams flavor. I also have to add that, for those of you that have played it, causing an opponents mouse to fall into a &quot;trap&quot; is as satisfying as getting to throw a piece into the volcano in Downfall of Pompeii.

There is alot of strategy to be had in this fun little game. The modular board also ensures endless variety. I am truely glad that I bought it.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s reminiscent of Stephenson&#039;s Rocket in some respects, and actually has a ton of new elements. The short time frame is great as well.</comment>				</item>

Game play was more strategic and back-and-forth than I had expected, however the near ties in the final scoring really put a cramp in my opinion. This game’s real saving grace was the speedy play time.

Good is you don’t over think it. It will get at least one more play to see if it eventually sinks or swims.

Has similar aspects to Acquire, but plays much more like Big City. Add trading to the mix, which I do so love, then you make a game of endless possibility. The trading knocks out the random element for the most part.

I played the new edition, but plan to break out my original and see how the bonus cards play out and whether to include them in future plays or not, and also to see how the different layout effects the game (I suspect not much).

It&#039;s almost entirely unique.I especially like that you have to pick your moment to strike, and that since other players cards contribute to your own, the card luck is almost entirely mitigated. There is also a nice level of bluffing inherent to the system.The art for this one is phenomenal as well.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Maybe Morgan will read this and get Z-Man to publish it.

You also have to be very flexible, as often opponents will beat you to what you were just about to build. I also think that you have to be willing to eat a good deal of corruption. I have only lost one game out of 6 plays, and that is due to the fact that I came VERY close to having the most corruption. It&#039;s a fine line you must walk, but it will lead you directly to victory.</comment>				</item>

While the coconuts to look somewhat like poo, which would also been thematic, they&#039;re bouncy and lead to some outrageous turns of events.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This game needs to be SHORTER. 

There are 4 sections: The Market , The Craftsmen, The Ships, and The Relics 

All 4 are random and all 4 need to align somehow to allow you to make points. That&#039;s not saying you can&#039;t save resources, goods, or money for the &quot;right time&quot;, but then making money with your goods is difficult as how many ships will sail is also random, and if like in our game an average of 1 ship sails, there aren&#039;t many opportunities to make money.

Random, random, random, and if you get lucky you make points.....and I came in second.

Sorry, this one is a PASS. It only gets a 6 for the core mechanisms.</comment>				</item>

I would actually liken the gathering of sets of tiles in this game to that of Ra, yet you cash them in to make a &quot;work&quot; like PoF. The individual tiles hold no value themselves though.

There is a good deal of luck in the tiles that come out and when, not to mention the fact that you have the die rolls to move the pieces around the track to gain bonuses and medals.

This game is WAY over produced.

There are more ways to gain points than in almost any other game I&#039;ve seen.

This will either be a 9 with further plays, or drop to a 7.

The game does a really god job of balancing itself, and even one false move can be recovered from.

I think that like most Wolfgang games that this one will pick up steam with age, and as people play it more they will appreciate it more.

Update: Dropped to a 7 then a 6. The movement of the pawns around the track is awful. 2 players can bounce them between on another, and he who starts with Caesar can win most of the time. There&#039;s also little variety in the shows, and even less control in them than at first blush. 15 plays proves this is really a 6. Play Princes of Florence or Leonardo instead.</comment>	<conditiontext>I continue to see room for planning, consistent trading, and consistent results of strategies in this game. I understand that it&#039;s not deep, or totally without luck, but you can certainly be consistent, and that is the mark of a good game. My rating rose from 8 TO 9.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Colt Express is nearly pure chaos with the basic game. That&#039;s a LARGE nearly, as repeated plays have seen significant decision points arise, but honestly, one errant card will derail you. The thing is, it happens to everyone fairly equally, so much like a bar room brawl you&#039;re just trying to get hit less than anyone else.

The game is fast, furious, and fascinating to watch unfold. It is full of flavor, and is just plain fun.</comment>				</item>

Update: Slowly improving over time, and perhaps might go higher. It now sits at a solid 7; meaning worth pulling out semi regularly in my book. This game is about resource manangement and taking risks. It&#039;s not all that hard to catch up with a crafty play or two.</comment>				</item>

It has a bundle of familiar mechanics implemented in new ways, and introduces new ones seamlessly. After 3 plays I can say this: It&#039;s not earth-shattering, but it&#039;s a credit to the economy genre, and one of the best at that.

Perhaps this will go up to a 9 with more plays, but I can definitely say it&#039;s no 10.

Update: A solid 7. Too bad the expansion doesn&#039;t do anything for this one.</comment>				</item>

The issue I have is just how &quot;sudden death&quot; our first play was. I&#039;m uncertain that the game could end in any other way without all players involved turtling. 

If the latter were to happen the game would become longer and the entire premise and game play are far too thin to support any length beyond an hour. This game should be fast, dirty, and nasty.

Another play is needed but somehow I think I&#039;ll be hard pressed to find opponents.</comment>	<conditiontext>Played once. Punched and bagged. Original insert included. Like New.</conditiontext>			</item>

Sometimes I was doing something evil and wonderful that I had waited half the game to do just to have the Allies deny me :( There were tons of back and forths but in the end, and we were playing on a later scenario, I came out WAY ahead as the Germans.

My only real trepidation playing them again is that they can make the game MUCH longer, and I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s worth while at that point.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;m pleasantly surprised and this one stays in the collection after a long time without a initial play. I&#039;m sure many wouldn&#039;t care for this based on it&#039;s serious abstract nature alone.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m really conflicted on this game.

It&#039;s fast light tile laying; it&#039;s got a simple system using action points; it&#039;s got simple pick up and deliver.

It&#039;s also counterintuitive in the fact that you often are reluctant to make moves like adding cities or creating loops as they work to mutual advantage rather than creating greater opportunity for yourself than other players.

It has the potential to be blissfully short, such as thirty minutes, which would certainly raise my rating. Another factor would be a couple other plays to find out just how strategic the set collection mechanism is and if that would make the risk/reward curve better.

Will either be a 7/8 or a 5.

Update:

5. I guess I&#039;m too much of a fan of heavier train games to be able to enjoy this properly, but to be honest it feels even lighter than ticket to ride. I just feel like it&#039;s a game of holding back to do what will benefit your opponents the least. </comment>				</item>

That all being said, this is a TOUGH coop; probably the toughest since Ghost Stories. Adding a traitor element. Ales it even harder, for both sides, and if your group is good at bluffing like ours is, there is serious tension added to the experience. 

We are just a few plays in and the a-ah! Moments keep coming in rapid fashion. With the upcoming expansion I expect this not only to see table time, but consume us for some time to come.</comment>				</item>

Despite many saying how &quot;easy&quot; this game is, I felt very in control as Overlord, and the game goes down to the bitter end.

Any &quot;imbalances&quot; in difficulty can easily be tweaked.

Another game that has had a map generator created, leaving almost endless play possibilities.</comment>				</item>

The play is fairly straight forward, combining tug of war games like Battline or Blood Bowl: Team Manager with the token collection and valuation of those tokens a-la Princes of the Renaissance. So there are 3 battles each round, worker placement which collects you cards, points, and tokens, and the result of each battle increases the value of the house whose side won, and ergo the value of the tokens increases.

My god are the decisions difficult. There&#039;s almost always 3 things you want to do at the same time, and ordering them is difficult and often gives something good away to another player. I find that a good thing as no one player can lock down all the good choices for themselves. There&#039;s also the matter of the captain you choose, or Dog of War, which has a special power and drives each players strategy a bit.

The game is WAY overproduced, but I love it for that as well.</comment>				</item>

There is quite a bit of information, almost overwhelmingly so at first. You soon realize that you only need to focus on what you need and what will affect you. That boils each round down to a hand full of actions and a much more manageable amount of information.

Tentative 7 after we called the game 2/3 of the way through our first play. We want to play again. We played with 3 and I think the game will be better with more, while 3 might be best played with experienced players or the latter and all players using 2 animals.

I&#039;ve read quite a bit about the end game scoring and given the volume of points that you gain, not to mention the game seems to be about gearing up for the end, we obviously missed a huge part of the game. We learned quite a bit, so it wasn&#039;t for naught. Perhaps another play will prove this a great game, or as it stands just an ok game that I had high hopes for.

Update:

Another play with 5 eliminated all my doubts and frustrations with DS. The game is brutal, requires detailed and abstract planning, and is almost completely unforgiving. Skilled players actually do have a chance to catch up and the game provides avenues to do so. 

It&#039;s a shame that Mr. Jensen&#039;s games require several plays to simply understand the actual goals and the important aspects of the game. Some people might view that as part of the discovery but it certainly makes players feel lost and somewhat helpless in initial plays. 

It&#039;s quite a game, easily in the top three heaviest games I&#039;ve ever played, and with subsequent plays threatens to push into my top ten of all time.

	<numplays>27</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a really great game that I suck at. I predict my rating will rise with further plays. It&#039;s got 3 rules, it&#039;s easy to learn, and turns go lighting fast. It&#039;s the essence of constructed CCG play without the CCG.

Update:

More plays, rating rises to 9.

Update:

It&#039;s a 10.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;m actually liking this one the more I play it, however I do not think this set is either as useful or versatile as previous releases.

It does seem that attempting strategies using Alchemy are frequently defeated by strategies that do not include cards from this set. Time will tell.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Cornucopia is the second in the line of &quot;small box&quot; Dominion expansions, which now means, I suppose, they will all have a quantity of cards some or all people do not like.

Unlike Alchemy, which had about 4 cards I would ever use again, there are only a few cards in this set I could do without. The reason in Alchemy was the use of the Potions, which I thought just took away from the game. Other cards were either too cruel or there were existing cards that didn&#039;t require a potion to acquire and had superior costing.

In the case of Cornucopia it&#039;s not quite the same. There are some cards that none of us would use at all. There are, however, some very nice additions to the game here.

One major note that lowers my overall score of Dominion when using this expansion: Also like Alchemy this does not seem to be a stand alone expansion. The game is VERY long unless you mix in cards from one of the 4 big box expansions and in future we certainly will treat it as such.</comment>				</item>

As the dev team continues to release new content the game continues to evolve into the vision that I think the designer had to begin with; in this respect I believe Dominion and RFtG are quite similar.

The game received several more layers and legs as long as it wishes to be.

And to think we still have 2 more planned expansions the second of whose theme is WAR.

The most unique aspect here is that it’s a racing game with an action point allowance system that also has a river whose course you can alter for fun and profit. The river itself is quit ingenious; however the scoring cards are random, but can come out in streaks to your negative benefit; especially later in the game when movement is much more limited.

It’s a fine game that’s for sure, and possibly one that will see play again, it’s just that I see more value in the mechanics and interactions than that of the overall play.

There is a large element of luck, but I have yet to lose a game after almost 10 plays, so that tells me there is more strategy here than meets the eye.

It&#039;s alot of fun, and as many other people have said, the chance to throw your opponents pieces into the volcano is just nasty fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Fantastic new minis game that feels like they melded chess and magic with a few other minis ideas.

What I especially like:

Preset board: no special movement ranges or measuring, or the like. Simple and easy. There is also a beginner&#039;s side of the board that has most of the starting rules on  it, including reminders about important info.

Info: Everything you need to know is right on the base of the mini. a summary is on top of the base. All the bases are color coded for easy reference.

Quality: Simply the best non metallic minis I have ever seen. They have McFarlane toys quality paint jobs as well. 

It&#039;s easy to learn too. The building of armies, just like deckbuilding in other games, is flexible, fun, and challenging.

Update: Now with the release of Night Fusion the game has definitely come into it&#039;s own. This is definitely the best set released thus far AS A WHOLE. It most certainly has some of the most powerful pieces in the game. Given this expansion, I have upgraded my rating to a 10.</comment>				</item>

I think with experience that time could come down significantly but I&#039;m just not certain that I want to play more than occasionally so it might never come down.

Further there are games that do this sort of thing better; one of which is their own design, R&amp;B.

Better than it&#039;s given credit for even if it is butt ugly.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s game is a bit more of a 2 player abstract puzzle with a heavy theme than the war game it might first appear to be; it&#039;s not really war at all, there&#039;s no active combat.

I like the bit of guessing and deduction, though the advanced rules allow for adjustments during the actual play and other weather changes to occur to continue to shake things up. 

The rules say it&#039;s longer than it is; perhaps with a ton of elements and still being new you&#039;d take longer, but a round of this is still a 30 minute experience.

I actually think my rating will rise over time.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This game seems to be inspired by the great PC game Dungeon Keeper.

It retains all the flavor and feel of said game while taking the best of worker placement and Vlaada&#039;s own mechanics, as well as tensions, from Galaxy Trucker and Space Alert.

There&#039;s certainly a heaping serving of luck and screwage, and much of the &quot;just survive&quot; element in this game; but perhaps that&#039;s much of the charm. Further once you have mastered the combat the game becomes an effortless fun-fest, and you can bask in the glory of your own evil.

It&#039;s more than what I expected, and on flavor alone this would get a 9; however the play is quite nice, and promises even better as it has a major set of unused components whose purpose is as yet unrevealed.

Can this designer fail? Not yet at least.</comment>				</item>

Skill checks are a simple &quot;roll two dice and hope you are equal or less than your score&quot;; though failures are rewarded with determination tokens for your next try, which means eventually you will pass.

The catacombs are a side game like affair that really can make stunning advances or escapes in the dungeon.

Should be played quickly and with as little thought as possible. Its totally random and often times totally insane!

A fun hour romp that no one is likely to survive.</comment>				</item>

They created a really nifty monster AI system; a great thing.

It&#039;s totally coop without the need of a moderator; a great thing.

It can be played in 90 minutes or less with 5; an amazing thing.

Our first game was great! Looking forward to more. If you want a good dungeon crawl with all the D&amp;D flavor in a short period of time, look no further.

The minis are also wonderful and seem ripe for replacement with their painted counter parts.</comment>				</item>

This game is like Roulette crossed with Slots.

The crazy part is that there are definite strategies and the game does a good job of mitigating it&#039;s own luck factor.

The outer track of the board is Roulette; two regions of the board pay out or everyone gets paid for one of 5 merchant or the king. There are cards you can gain to increase this payout. Every card that provides a bonus is keyed to a specific region, but also pays out on all merchants and king cumulatively.

The cards themselves are like slots. You activate regions where you have influence markers allowing for a random pull from that color deck. There&#039;s some set collection involved for some decks while one is all bonus vps or payout increases. There are however, ways to get multiple pulls, and the volume mitigates luck here.

The whole game is one big gamble yet it doesn&#039;t feel totally random nor a big mess. 

One thing is for sure: This is one of Colovini&#039;s best.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Eclipse is not the second coming of 4x as many would have you believe. It is, however, and interesting combination of old ideas. I believe the randomness of exploration and the reputation tiles will turn many players away while others will find ways to overcome those elements to see the neat system that lies underneath.

For me it is the simplicity and clarity of combat and the rules for it. I love the way the tech is handled and that you&#039;re not forced into a tree. The game encourages combat (though some would have you believe turtling still rules the day).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I was thinking I should rate this lower but I just can&#039;t; it&#039;s simply much better than I could have ever hoped.

I know that sounds negative, but given the glut of worker placement games over the past few years, I&#039;m sure many of you can identify with those feelings.

I think the genius in this game lies in the fact that the people furthest ahead go later in the turn, but the clincher is that the worker placement balances the turn order with only allowing you to place further down the river than your previous placements, making decisions quite tense.

While there are a number of random elements here, there is an equal number of predictable ways to gain vp&#039;s. I also like the nod to roads and boats in the pyramid scoring.

Count me pleasantly surprised.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Fantastic twist to the &quot;Settlers Odds&quot; system. Much more of a gamer&#039;s game than any other in the series IMHO, and many more ways to directly effect your opponents.

Update:

A little long for what it is, especially since experienced players can drive this to a weird end game. Perhaps it&#039;s our group think, but either way it&#039;s for trade.</comment>	<conditiontext>Gently Used: For Trade or Best Cash Offer</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s an Arkham dice-based coop romp. There are some significant decisions to be had but none that should make the game play as long as the box says (1-2 hours???). It&#039;s a 30-45 minute dice fest with all the frills, spills, and tension of the very best dice games.

It&#039;s quality in every way, my only concern being that the game might be too easy for &quot;advanced&quot; players, IE people that game A LOT. Two plays in so that remains to be seen.</comment>				</item>

The issue is that it still plays in 2-2.5 hours and other games in our stable, like Eclipse, can be played with more bang for the buck. Further, the last few turns are min maxing which deflates an otherwise good experience to purely average.</comment>				</item>

Update:

Thought play has fallen off after 20+ games it&#039;s not something I would ever turn down. We&#039;ve since gone back and played Goa and Industrial waste and this one seems to do things faster/lighter/better. You accomplish so much so fast. It would likely have gone up to a 9 or 10 if Hansa Teutonica had never come out.</comment>				</item>

That all being said, if you already play Magic I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;d play this.

I&#039;d also add that multiplayer is REALLY long.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I had thought I was getting into basically the latter half of Downfall of Pompeii wherein you draw random lava tiles to reduce your opponents possible score. In the most literal sense this is indeed what you&#039;re doing. This is not related to that experience in any other way, however. It&#039;s mainly trying to make best use of a lava tile, either offensively or defensively. You have to make some hard choices at times given that you harm others, or gain resources, or simply stem the tide of lava at your doorstep. Sometimes a play is a real gamble, which adds to the tension. The card play in the game is also multi-faceted and all cards are always useful. My favorite aspect of the game is that the more damage you take the greater the bonuses you have. It&#039;s even feasible to intentionally take damage or deal yourself damage simply to gain bonuses to strengthen your game.

So far with both 2 and 3 players this is quite a good game. It has moderate luck and moderate tactics. There are ways to make the game more strategic, found in the variants of the game, but I&#039;m not sure I would want it to be. I&#039;m interested in trying the game with all player counts. given that this goes to 6 I&#039;m sure the chaos factor, and the utter insanity, will actually lead to a different kind of fun; or so I hope. With 2 or 3 the games were entirely different animals, in a very good way. This game has easily met my expectations and is a good deal of fun. It&#039;s also CHEAP, even at a FLGS, and the components are quite nice for the price.

I can&#039;t wait to try the included expansions, and I think this will have quite a number of plays before its popularity wanes with us.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Simply one of the best two players games to come down the pike in a very long time. This game honors the very best that is the heritage established by the Kosmos two player line.

It&#039;s really a game of hand/deck/tableau building. If there are no zero value cards on the board you can discard a card from the display. You add back cards from the draw pile equal to the value of the one you discarded. There are 3 factions. One acts as a joker, one as a discount, one can return cards you used to your hand, and the last is just worth more points than any other faction. The game is played by playing a pair of the same faction and value which allows you to pick up a card of a value one higher. The card you gain and one of the cards you used to gain it return to your hand, the remaining card is placed face up in your tableau. The trick to the game is: clever use of jokers and returning them to your hand, using the discounts in concert with this or making the cards zero value (you can pick up zeros for nothing), and timely use of the faction that allows you to return used cards form your tableau. It&#039;s actually much more diabolical that it seems, and much more complex than first blush.

Awesome Maura art tied into a wonderful efficiency engine makes for a very wonderful game. There are a ton of tough choices. Often times you have to play a bit of a push your luck game. The first half is totally random, but the second time through the deck, given that you have a decent memory, you can actually have some foresight as to possible draws.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A rather deceptively complex abstract that takes at least a few plays before you understand the long term ramifications of placement. 

You simply have to be aware of what the tile is, how it gathers points and how to place it so that you at least get a few points for it. An average of 5 per piece will win you the game, so it&#039;s easy to think &quot;oh I would have gotten 15 before I was surrounded, now I get 2&quot; but it&#039;s the big picture that experience brings.

Combined with having yet another complete variant set included in the box there&#039;s long legs in this box; the box is a bit oversized though :)</comment>				</item>

Given that everyone has the same hand, and that only 10 of the 11 cards will get played, this game is about 60% strategy and 40% luck. I like this one a lot and it&#039;s soon to become a fast favorite IMHO.

Update:

After a few plays this one never caught on. Much like High Society the system is love or hate; almost everyone in my group hates both.</comment>				</item>

There is, however, some control when it comes to surviving the events but it seems somewhat separated from the rest of your game and your &quot;strategy&quot;. It&#039;s certainly more of an old-school romp and that&#039;s what should be expected. Hell, GARY FREAKING GYGAX WAS A PLAYTESTER!

Someone in the forums mentioned statistical probability of the two dice and that there is a zone for best placement of new tiles. I cannot imagine finding a statistically probable zone given that you are not combining the values of the two dice rolled rather you are creating coordinates.

We all enjoyed our first experience and look to see if a second game makes this rise or fall in opinion.</comment>				</item>

Played twice in it&#039;s first outing, it offers a bit more strategy than you&#039;d expect. 

It&#039;s a fun romp that should last for quite a while; though we&#039;ll see which is why it&#039;s got a provisional 7.

Update: While there are a few elements of chaos here, there&#039;s certainly enough strategy for the long term. 6 Plays and counting :) Upped rating to an 8.</comment>				</item>

Every game feels different, and AP aside, is generally fast and interesting. I never imagined that DoW would make a true gamer&#039;s game, but here it is.</comment>				</item>

THERE IS MORE. My rating rose to a 7. So this isn&#039;t a wonderous original game, but it&#039;s a very good game that has some subtle signs you have to train yourself to observe. The role switching is certainly this game&#039;s unique contribution as you really MUST switch roles at some point otherwise you will fail.

There have been times of being seemingly way ahead and some crazy circumstances happening. It at first appeared luck, but then we recognized some signs and realized where we had gone wrong.

What does all this add up to? A game that&#039;s seriously growing on me and that I want to play more. It plays in 30-40 minutes, so that&#039;s a REAL plus for something is dynamic.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Fleet is an interesting mix. It has the auction system of Power Grid, though no replenishment between the auctions, and it has the tableau building plus the engine building of Race for the Galaxy.

It&#039;s clean and simple yet still feels a bit meaty and gives a satisfying sense of accomplishment; all in a 30-40 minute play time. 

The only downer is that the theme isn&#039;t very exciting, but the game is good enough that it doesn&#039;t detract from the experience either.

My rating may yet go up with more plays and use of the expansion materials, which are surprisingly modular.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Kickstarted - Due December 2013 - Delayed to February/March</wishlistcomment></item>

Plays quickly and differently enough to be worth owning. 

Perhaps even more random that can cause more screwage or an easier game.</comment>				</item>

Update: After several more plays the seeming depth just isn&#039;t there. The call tokens are a joke, and seem almost meaningless. The game also overstays it&#039;s welcome, then ends so abruptly the best thing that can be said is &quot;what should we play next&quot;.</comment>	<conditiontext>Like New: For Trade or Best Cash Offer</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Won at Euroquest 2010!!!

Tentative 7, played with 2, 3, and 4; best with 4 so far.

Interesting game of weighing using the bonus cards for their advantages versus saving the money to create a pool and eventually build the monuments.

It&#039;s kind of like starting a deck building game half way through but with a stock market mechanism and tableau management. Totally unexpected and much better than I had first believed.

I&#039;m totally uncertain of any firm strategy but I can certainly say that as long as this is played at a 45 minute maximum then it&#039;s a fine game.

Update:

The advanced game makes this one a 9. It&#039;s worth playing the basic rules to understand the game, the buildings, and the overall flow of the game.

Playing with the advanced rules makes the game shorter, much more intense, and previewing 1/3 of your deck, then seeing additional cards and brings your total to seeing half your deck, allows for some serious planning, precognition, and if your memory serves you well, strategy.

I&#039;m certain this game will fool most into thinking there&#039;s nothing there at all. I find it a shame when games use the basic version as the default when the real meat and potatoes is listed at the end of the rules as an advanced version.

Update:

Repeated plays really show this one as a consistent performer both as a game and in plays with our group.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Using the cards in your hand you bid. Cards won become part of your deck. Eight cards are auctioned a round. You start each round with 6 cards. you do not get more cards unless all players run out, in which case discards and remaining deck are reshuffled and hands are refilled to 6 (I haven&#039;t seen this yet). 

It&#039;s a minor deck building element coupled with auction and set collection for end game bonuses. 

It&#039;s fast, it&#039;s easy, and it&#039;s quite fun. Totally unique as a filler in its&#039; style and implementation of its&#039; mechanics.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>There&#039;s more here akin to Twilight Imperium than any other game. It&#039;s lighter, faster, and easier to get into, but still has a wealth of avenues to victory. It&#039;s also VERY easy on the eyes. 

Interestingly it has an exploration option that works very similarly to Big Kini...another game I like.

It&#039;s not &quot;original&quot; in the most common sense, but what it does do is deliver a solid, tense, fun game, with plenty of opportunity for player interaction. 

Update:

Eclipse just upped the ante and made this game irrelevant.</comment>				</item>

I do have to specify that you can mitigate your luck in 2 ways: you can look at the event cards so you know what&#039;s coming (even though you sacrifice build time, and you get to know the cards over a few plays anyway), and as you get better at building.</comment>				</item>

Easily the most complex card game I have ever played.

Update: 

Now it&#039;s a 9. Plays as well with three as it does 4.

Update:

It&#039;s a 10. Simply the best multiplayer constructible game I&#039;ve ever played. The more I dig into it the more I see that I didn&#039;t know. Everyone in our group that&#039;s played loves it.</comment>				</item>

The game maintains the simplicity while adding difficulty and several new mechanics like cover and range to the formula. The entire &quot;level&quot; is built and populated making the experience more intense as the whole board marches toward you. I also like the idea of the quadruple use command cards, that work roughly like the Command and Colors system; Your hand is your life total, how you use special actions, how you perform regular actions, and perform reactions.

Corey continues to be a designer to watch. OH, and did I mention the BEAUTIFUL bits and the wonderful art on the cards and tiles?</comment>				</item>

Since you aren&#039;t building features per say, and you can take any color resource cube you wish when you build, added to the fact that you can build over almost any existing tile, makes this game different from any I have seen before. This is NOTHING LIKE CARCASSONNE!

Update: Another play and even more ways this game can play out. Tile luck is minimal as you have to gamble if what you&#039;ve done will last another turn or whether to score now! Another interesting element is that you always have a stock of two tiles in front of you, so you can always hold onto a tile for the right moment. This is definately a quality game, but stay away if you don&#039;t enjoy conflict.

On another side bar, David Fair told me he had made 3o some odd points in one go, and I thought that was outrageous...until I scored 42 in one shot!

Fun, fast,....oh yeah, and fun.</comment>				</item>

I think it scales even better in terms of difficulty, and that there is less luck that drives   your win/loss.

In any case, I like the way it shakes the game up, I like the ghosts it adds, and look forward to playing it more when we are &quot;ready&quot;.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>So what we have here was an apparent rework of a mechanic from Witch&#039;s Brew that apparently is actually from an older game that Ewe created; go figure.

Many people have said there are few choices, but I actually disagree. Of course, those choices and your planning can be largely mitigated or accelerated by opponents&#039; card play.

For some reason this game grabs me. Not in a huge way, but what I found interesting in Witch&#039;s and chose to leave behind is much better developed and diversified in this game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>WOW! A very nice card game in the same vein as San Juan and RftG, with a totally different spin on things.

Some really nice, smooth play and interesting interactions.

Should cure my Race burnout for a while, and in tandem with Race almost certainly assures that San Juan won&#039;t see much play again.

Update:

Took some time away after a handful of plays of this. Playing other games by this designer, more RftG, and a number of other games really renewed my interest and all those combined skill in the game. 

In all the game is much shorter for our gaming experience not to mention MUCH FASTER. Play time is down to the 40 minute mark.</comment>				</item>

You cannot spend multiple turns building up; you cannot form a very long term strategy at all. You can however invest your self across multiple areas, save resources for scoring, and at an opportune moment strike while the iron is hot.

I&#039;m certain some are frustrated when they do not make large gains or when other players catch up, but it&#039;s the small points here and there, not to mention the most efficacious use of your double move that will win you the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>As most other reviews you might read, this too is a negative opinion. I actually went into this game after having read the other opinions, so I had no illusions that this might be a GREAT game, but certainly GOOD would have been nice.

I think the main issue is that the advanced cards only serve to muddy a good, basic system. The basic cards are superior for what your trying to do. Another issue is direct interaction. This game should be all about it, but ultimately serves up a bland point-fest. Even smashing buildings isn&#039;t all that fun.

We&#039;ll try again in teams to see if that spices things up, but my hopes are VERY low.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I loved this game at first as I thought it was vicious, and full of conflict. That assessment has not changed over time, but the sheen has dulled over the years. 

I love the area control, and I love the majorties game inherent to the system.

I hate the random luck of &quot;who gets to do an action twice&quot;, and the share cards.

A recent play has brought me to the conclusion that the card luck is VERY difficult to overcome in this game. Therefore the rating as plummeted to a 6, and is probably soon to be an ex-game in my collection.</comment>	<conditiontext>Gently Used: For Trade or Best Cash Offer</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Gosu is about building the most valuable tableau. After everyone passes for the round tableaus are evaluated (quite easily) and the winner gets a vp. Win 3 vps and win the game.

There are quite a few nods to MtG here. I&#039;m a huge goblin fan from my Magic days so this certainly doesn&#039;t hurt my enthusiasm about the game.

There is room for both long term strategy and short term tactics amid the chaos that this game is. I also like to say &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; as it always seems to even out luck-wise in the long run.

Good, tempered, hand management, and clever use of synergy rule the day.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Due out in September. Uses a cool Goblin theme and wonderful art. Tableau builder.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Pardon the vernacular, but for those of us who know; anyone who has played the drinking game asshole has played something much akin to this game. The only difference being that there are 12 suits (numbered one thru 12) rather than 4. The number of the suit relating the quanitiy of that card in the deck. A basic game with a mild amount of strategy. Luck wins out the day for the most part, but its a fun romp with a group of friends, that doesn&#039;t try to take itself to seriously, as you do not keep score.</comment>				</item>

Essentially you have a abstract quasi-pick-up-and-deliver game with special powers. It&#039;s fast and intense, the only real down side is for those who have poor spatial visualization skills, who&#039;ll have trouble plotting their turns and the costs involved. 

Otherwise we have a fine addition to the Splotter stable.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is a somewhat generic drafting game, though it&#039;s cleaner and simpler than 7 Wonders or even Fairy Tale. The spin in this game is the combos. Much like you would combo in Dominion within your deck build, this game has you doing it a bit more openly within a tableau. The downside is that some combos work better than others given certain player counts. Another negative is that while some combos are really great the draw back is that they make certain lackluster ones amazing in the face of them, basically giving away the game.

Perhaps with more plays timing will be a bigger element, balancing out the negatives I see. Overall a decent enough filler that we do enjoy.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Kickstarted - Due June 2014</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m going to give this a tentative 8. That could easily rise or fall with additional plays depending on how things play out. As of right now all those involved in the first play though there was PLENTY more we could have done, certianly more corps would have changed control, more would have been created, and in the end the game would have evolved more. 

The best thing so far is that everyone wants to play again. There&#039;s some negotiation, which we all quite like, there&#039;s SOME control in terms of which corps you get into (though not much); I think it&#039;s a question of gambits in hopes to get into particular compnaies by playing cards that serve them best and once you get a chance to be the CEO then acting out your vision for the best cash until you can bail for the big payout.

One disappointment is that there&#039;s only an illusion that you&#039;re controlling the market. In the end the market swells and then recedes at a given rate and I do not see that changing much from game to game.

I think this is certainly a game for those who also enjoy Imperial, yet it&#039;s more the economics and less the board play.</comment>				</item>

Someone said it was just average.

This one is totally different, being a more building and majorities game with special scorings smattered throughout. It&#039;s amazing how the same mechanism, and even slightly different takes on the same base concepts serve up a totally new experience. Very brain melty to boot. Will certainly rise in rating with more plays.</comment>				</item>

Too light, too luck based, too long for what it is.

The Good: Set collection and creative hand management for building sites.

The Bad: Random bonus tiles that instantly change the tide of the game.</comment>				</item>

While using a version of the sliding scale mechanism from Goa and Endeavor, yet maintaining yet another different interpretation, this game couples that with what is essentially worker placement, majorities, and hand management; yet in a whole new fashion that I have never seen.

The game is fast paced and tense, and quite fun. I expect my rating to rise.

UPDATE:

Now a 10. Are ya happy Jonathan? =p</comment>				</item>

The &quot;action&quot; cities are re-imagined, rearranged, recombined, and much harder to commandeer to rush the game clock. Permanent bonuses are on the board now with new and more powerful abilities.

Overall the new board serves to shake things up for experienced players and perhaps even attempt to mitigate negatives detractors have served up in the past; successfully I might add.

I still like the base map but after almost two dozen plays I was ready for a change of pace and Steding did not disappoint.

Perhaps after a number of plays I&#039;ll revisit the original map to see how the new secondary expansion, the cards, shakes things up.

Having played the final version it&#039;s basically the same game with some end game bonuses. Our last game was VERY close, then ended in an 11 point difference in the end. It felt almost impossible to deny the leader. Perhaps that&#039;s just an exception, hopefully time will tell. I would just hate for close games to suddenly become a runaway in the latter half of the game.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;ll hate it so much that I&#039;ll buy the German edition so I can play it before an English release. I might even hate it so much that I do full color paste-ups.

I KNOW I will hate it enough to buy the English edition as well.

Update:

It&#039;s Agricola&#039;s cousin Sally; the HOT cousin. She likes you, and you&#039;l love her right back.

The actions are buildings, and while there are some centralized actions, the majority are spread between the players as they &quot;build&quot; them. It can be a bit tougher to know what your options are at a glance, but there are MORE options, MORE synergy, and MORE avenues to victory. There are also more bits in this one than Agricola.

Play time is relatively the same, though I think the learning curve longer.

Update Update:

Ewe is 2 for 2. Amazing. Fantastic, multipathed system. I&#039;m enjoying this one just as much as Agricola.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s one part Ascension, in it&#039;s tactical nature and buy/combat row; yet you&#039;re building a tableau and can attack other player&#039;s tableau/army for points, which is another way to reach an end game condition.

It&#039;s strange that those two games have so many similarities yet came out at the same time.

I think I&#039;m leaning toward Graxia a bit more yet Ascension has such a short play time and setup/breakdown to it&#039;s advantage.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s not as heavy as it was billed, it also isn&#039;t the best Rondel game IMHO.

Quite good, starts out at an 8.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I would never have imagined that, while there are some significant differences, this game would be SO similar to the original. I certainly need to go back and play that game again, but for all intents purposes I think the map alone makes this a superior animal. 

One thing I have never tried though is the investor variant, and having played this series again I can think of so many reasons that I might want to play either way. There are some incredible timing considerations when playing with it, and I feel like there might be too many changes to control of nations without it; so what I&#039;m saying is that, at this point, I think I&#039;m in favor of the investor.

The rule book was a mess, and it took 3 player aids/summaries/sets of clarifications to even get into the game. 

This game was a cardboard travesty. A shame really as this was on the back burner since it&#039;s release and was highly anticipated.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Bears a vague similarity to Pillars, but vague might be too strong a term. This game has tension throughout, and is incredibly well balanced with a pleathora of strategies available.

Update: After further play I&#039;ve found that the latter half of the game can become somewhat procedural and in a way predictable. Many of the choices lose any worth. 

There&#039;s also an issue that you can be behind and stay behind.

It&#039;s really not bad for something occasionally played.</comment>				</item>

Since all 105 cards are unique and totally random draws, not to mention some of the effects can cause a bit of chaos; this game is not for the feint of heart.

That being said there is a TON of strategy in the game. Experienced players know when to change cards, activate dogmas, and more. 

It&#039;s really a fun experience. The only downside is that it does take some experience to get the play time down from 15 minutes a player, but that&#039;s hardly a bad thing.

I&#039;m thinking my rating will rise.

Update:

Rating rose to a 9. There is far more control here if you invest time in learning the cards. It&#039;s just like playing Race or Dominion; card knowledge is key.</comment>				</item>

A larger number of available symbols seemingly evens out the odds letting players either even out or specialize. Further, bonus icons add a new dimension to the score system. Finally, Echos cap off the clever factor by allowing monumentally momentous turns taking this game to a 10.</comment>				</item>

We actually play with the whole set, which makes for a 90 minute game (which we love) but the complexity is high and definitely not for everyone. We have tried Figures with just the base game and it&#039;s awesome with that as well.

I can&#039;t wait to see what the next expansion brings.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s stunningly beautiful, easy to learn, and fun to play.</comment>	<conditiontext>I find it beautiful, light, luck based (with a smattering of hand management and strategy), and extremely fun.

If you don&#039;t overthink it, a game, even with 5 players, zips by in 40 minutes.

Very fun racing game. It got 4 plays in the first weekend I owned it.</conditiontext>			</item>

It&#039;s an action point system wherein you try to develop a card advantage engine ultimately allowing you to sell more and win. There are slight variances to the strategy, but that is it&#039;s core.

The game can be lighting fast. Hoping to nab the expansions some time soon.</comment>				</item>

The overall idea was good, but future plays will either redeem this one, or put it on the trade pile.

And yes, the box is too damn big.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>First:

- If you&#039;re expecting GW or Reaper quality you&#039;re kidding yourself for this money

- If you&#039;re expecting a sports game it&#039;s not that at all, it&#039;s more of a combat game crossed with a king of the hill game

Talk about exceeding expectations! The miniatures are easily the best I&#039;ve seen in anything other than FF stuff and the Ringers are multi-piece molds, so they&#039;re more detailed than that. The quality throughout is great and a few plays already shows the depth it has.

The game itself plays like a couple of multiplayer modes from first person shooters. One mode it plays like is king of the hill. If you can get a runner to remain on a scoring zone at the end of a round/period you get points. The other mode it plays like is Skull from Halo, which is &quot;hold onto the ball and get points the longer you do&quot;. How that translates here is when a runner is on a scoring zone with the ball, instead of scoring at the end of a round they score at the beginning of each turn for that player. 

There&#039;s a ton of micro customization, most similar to Star Wars: X-Wing, though you bid for the handful of upgrades and ringers (super duper players with a special ability) with a meager amount of money. You&#039;ll also use that cash for getting rid of cheating cards to avoid penalty points, so money is TIGHT.

Everything plays out in an hour or less; even our very first game only took about 60 minutes. It&#039;s another win for Eric Lang, and it&#039;s a complete system, so it&#039;s going to be a joy to explore.

[b][u]Core Team Ratings:[/u][/b]

[b]Ogres:[/b] 8 - Stomp is HIGHLY subjective, and often useless. When they&#039;re ON they are ON.

[b]Amazons:[/b] 9 - Wow, what an evil ability, and a +2 fight makes them tough to outlast.

[b]Demons:[/b] 10 - The easiest core team to play as, though I think in the long run they might have a predictable strategy.

[b]Fangs:[/b] 10 - Their stats are awesome, and their ability keeps them coming back at you with little fear.


[hr]

[b][u]Core Ringer Ratings:[/u][/b]

[b]Macho Libre:[/b] 10 - You want a team that can tackle, but in the long run he&#039;ll help outscore you, and if you&#039;re not getting kill points he will help will ruin you before the half.

[b]Dragon:[/b] 10 - Another killer ringer. 8 move on a sprint, 9 with one speed training, 10 with 2. What team is Dragon NOT good for?

[b]Cretin[/b] UNPLAYED

[b]T-Bone:[/b] 8 - One high priority tackle target, of course he does basically negate being attacked and a couple of the teams love his auto-heal. T-Bone + Brick = Madness

[b]Spectre[/b] UNPLAYED

[b]Zorra[/b] UNPLAYED

[b]Kong Bad (AKA Thrilla Gorilla):[/b] UNPLAYED

[b]Pandamonium:[/b] 9- The big dumb panda makes you hate reacting, and it&#039;s awesome...if he&#039;s your ringer. :)

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This might be the quintessential dudes on a map game. It&#039;s all about the tech and combat. If you&#039;re shy of conflict, you need not apply. Another great part of the game is that it doesn&#039;t overstay it&#039;s welcome; there are just too many ways to get points for that to ever happen.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>While one of Breese&#039;s lesser games it&#039;s still not a bad one. 

It&#039;s quite abstract and with almost all of the pertinent information decentralized and somewhat visually hard to track, it can be a little difficult to gather intel for your next move.

Another negative is that you essentially have to wait for your turn to plan as tiles can be stolen and the ones you had up for auction or others you hoped to buy may no longer be present.

I did enjoy my play and as long as the play time and downtime between turns reduces with future plays it will certainly remain in circulation.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I spent the first half of my first play thinking &quot;is this all there is?&quot;. I continued to wonder about the marginal gains everyone was making. I continued to be unenthusiastic.

The second half of the game was an awakening. I had developed a rhythm for putting workers on the board and when to take them off. I had promoted workers in my guilds. I had also gotten good and arranging the turn order I needed. Indeed the game blossomed into everything I had hoped, even if our first play was a little long.

So we have Breese&#039;s classic interpretation of resource gathering and worker placement combined with a ladder climbing affair coupled with resource management. In all, as long as the play times come down I certainly look forward to playing this for many games to come.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Even though this game is not 100% Breese it&#039;s still the best Breese game since Reef Encounter. 

I love the combination of elements that seem to be derived from other games, but still they&#039;re used here in a unique way. It certainly doesn&#039;t feel like anything else in my collection. I also enjoyed the wide variety of avenues to gain vp&#039;s, the way you could manipulate your position, and the ways you could manipulate your ability to, well, manipulate :)

Oh, and it&#039;s a 90 minute game that&#039;s only going to get faster in time. That&#039;s an amazingly short period of time for a game with so much going on.</comment>				</item>

The Good: Hunting the good doctor is interesting and serves as a fun competition.

The Bad: Deadlocks in the line of sight and even the random weapons/foils that drag the game out until the fun burns out and you have to play another hour more.</comment>				</item>

There&#039;s actually some strategy as the &quot;artifacts&quot; do have tactical use to them and you can save/create combos of swords for well timed attacks. There&#039;s even a bit of basic deduction/guessing game play going on that make this one intriguing.

If it were longer it would be a dog, but it&#039;s so fast we even play several times in a row. Reminds me of when we played Zev&#039;s first small box release Fairy Tale.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m giving this a preliminary 8 with the feeling it will rise to rival KoT. 

It&#039;s a Trzewiczek style evolution of a system, which is a very good thing. The dice have been massively tweaked making each roll more tense and decision filled. 

It&#039;s a bit longer, but much of that seems to be inexperience. The game also seems to lean toward winning by VPs, even though tons of damage is doled out and players killed, it seems TPKO wins might not occur as often. Time will tell.

So far owning both is a great thing. The old game is so different, especially with expansions, that I won&#039;t be selling it off any time soon.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a dice chucker that can be played in 20 minutes even at full player count. There&#039;s a very MINOR tactic of attacking to take over &quot;the hill&quot; and when to duck out. Otherwise it&#039;s just dice.

Update:

Now a 9 with the inclusion of Power Up!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>While the expansion does have a higher price point than many might prefer it offers quite a bit to the fans of the game. The fifth player adds little length but some fierce competition, while the new bonus tiles fill the gaps that were left by the base game and even add a couple nifty ideas. I like the idea of most of the nomad tiles though there is one that I will never play with again as it seems against the spirit of the game.  The most significant addition is the new scoring cards; when the conditions are met you gain the vp&#039;s immediately. That means that you can often reuse those settlements with bonus tiles and this makes for a significant strategic shift in the game play.

While I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a need for another expansion (though now that the game has won SdJ there will be, I am certain) I&#039;d welcome it. This game continues to have legs for our group with almost 20 play and still going strong.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>What a nice, fresh take on the so called &quot;Yahtzee&quot; genre of games. Much like Ysphahan, the dice luck has been per mutated into something entirely different, and almost entirely controllable. The characters and buildings seem well balanced, and the game is a joy to play.
I&#039;m not so sure the king is worth it, as I feel the queen is the best deal on the board (tied with the alchemist). Beautiful art too.

Update: The luck of the dice kills it for me sometimes. There have been a few recent losses that I can attribute directly to luck. Downgraded to a 7.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>At one time this was a grail game I had decided to give up on. I&#039;m so happy JR decided to reprint this, and despite a few production issues, the game is really great.

I&#039;ve played modern games such as Power Struggle or Tribune, but nothing quite this cutthroat. The only downside I&#039;ve seen is the three rules sets. Our first play was with the &quot;original&quot; rules. Looking at the other two sets I can definitely see why no one really plays with any of the three, much less the same set of rules as each other. I like that you can easily pick and choose what you like, play with it, and the core experience never changes; that&#039;s the sign of good design.

I look forward to many more plays.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Kickstarted - Due January 2014

Gameplay is tight, and tense. This is definately one of the better area control/majorities games I have played.</comment>	<conditiontext>Update:

Upped this one to an 8. It&#039;s a solid effort, hampered only by the fact that there is randomness in the cards that select which regions will be scored next. There are ways to mitigate this luck, and it doesn&#039;t even have a &quot;game breaking&quot; affect on the game, but it&#039;s there.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It’s simply the definitive zombie game. 

Though movement is still dice driven, character abilities and event cards create offsets to the detriments of the movement, and truly most of the flaws you might find here. I also enjoy that the game play is simple to the point that AP shouldn’t ever have a home, and that the turns are bite sized enough that the game moves along briskly. Further, since combat often occurs on both zombie and hero turns there always seems like something to do. The objectives also seem well balanced and impress a sense of urgency and tension heretofore unseen in other games of its ilk.

This one is already slated for our Halloween party, and it’s certain to see more than one play that day; certainly many more to come.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Last Will is a tableau building game with the central action selection mechanism found in Pergammon, though a bit different in its implementation.

The stress of the simple turn order mechanism is amazing and is scaled incredibly well based on number of players. I also find it fascinating that a game with so much randomness doesn&#039;t feel random at all, and indeed you can mitigate most of the luck in such a way as to make your endgame feel well planned and structured. I think the timing decisions are the biggest challenge and will take the longest to learn. I also love that your tableau size is limited and that in just 8 rounds you have to sacrifice to expand it; and this is also a gamble.

In all I love it and finally have felt like my skill is &quot;decent&quot; after 4 plays.</comment>				</item>

The real refinement here is the action spaces; the combinations aren&#039;t randomized but they have been fine tuned and in some cases completely altered from the base game.

So there you have it, you can either take that as an omen to save yourself $$ or you can buy it and know it&#039;s not going to do anything wacky or zany to the game you know and love AND you&#039;ll get some new features.</comment>				</item>

Actually a game of fairly high strategy with a smattering of luck from the special cards to break up the seriousness.

Perhaps a bit long for what it is if you don&#039;t use the short game rules, but fantastically perfect in it&#039;s shorter form even with a larger number of players.

I have to give a big not to the graphic design on this one; simply wonderful graphics.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Somehow this game has a feeling of Princes of Florence about it. The gameplay isn&#039;t very similar, and it&#039;s not the Italian theme either, but somehow, this game feels very remeniscent of Princes. I think that it has alot to do with having to collect various components to complete inventions for points. Money is points and points are money. There are a few other things in the game that bring that same air as well; and that&#039;s a good thing.

That being said, I very much like this game. There is so much to do in so little time.</comment>	<conditiontext>Update: Took this up a notch to a 9. There is ALOT more forward planning that one can do to eliminate the possibilities of more than one person building the same invention. There is still an element of &quot;dumb luck&quot; as the final inventions reveal themselves and some people just happen to have the resources for a gold on hand. </conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Finally a game that follows the same vein as 51st State with multi-function cards. It&#039;s more of a race than anything, and exhillerating until the end.

There&#039;s an interesting counterpoint between the hand management and resource management aspects of the game. You want to rotate through your hand as fast as you can but when you do you also get penalized for carrying over too many resources and Indians. You might try and reduce your resource and Indian load but then each card becomes less efficient. 

One thing is for certain: No two players will play the game the same, at least not until after MANY plays. 

I really love the Dutrait art as well.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Game Salute - Nov 30 release</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>You know, I&#039;ve played a good deal of Wallace games, and yet I still didn&#039;t know quite what to expect.

It&#039;s a mixture of hand management, area control, and something totally indescribable.

There&#039;s an immense amount amount of information to process, not just as a first timer, but even throughout the game in general.

I think the most unique aspect was managing when to apply your cards for tie breakers. Further, creating intentional ties that you know only you can win due to having the proper colored card is nothing short of sinister.

It&#039;s a classic Wallace game that will surely see more plays in the future, but one thing is for certain: it&#039;s one of my top 5 heaviest games played of all time.

Tentative 9, with aspirations of a 10; just like Age of Steam began, and lived up to.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>In my mind this is Wallace&#039;s take on RftG; not an entirely bad thing.

As a whole I have no issues with the design itself. The cards work well. The cards, while basic, blend together seamlessly with no &quot;dead&quot; ones in the mix. I even like the discard area and the player driven timer that it represents.

The game is, however, completely unintuitive and dare I say totally counter intuitive. This in combination with the classic unforgiving Wallace design sense in which there are usually few chances to catch up created a very frustrating and skewed-scoring first play.

Willing to play at least one more time to decide how disappointed I really am.

Update:

Play number two with two major changes:

1 - It&#039;s amazing how much better the game plays when you have the rules correct and play more than one card per &quot;play cards&quot; action.

2 - Everyone took loans. Another massive improvement and removed many barriers in the game&#039;s economy.

Those being said the game was wonderful, tense, highly competitive, and thoroughly enjoyable.

My rating rises from a 6 to an 8.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Ordered as a gift for us.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>While our first play was with 3 and I think we need more players I think it&#039;s just a fact that racing games like this aren&#039;t really for me. This offers some interesting card play yet most of the game is still cruise control. I still think the best one is Manilla as there is actual change and interaction round to round an a larger variety of bets that aren&#039;t game-long.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It was our group&#039;s pleasure to test this game for 8 months. We were even lucky enough to relieve a final prototype to play before the game was sent to the printer. It&#039;s extremely gratifying to finally play the finished product. 

The game is about completing all the stages in 9 rounds which takes a cooperative effort but along the way the system allows you to take advantage of the system itself, but more importantly the other players for your own gain. Some really clever things can be done, some wild situations occur, and most importantly the game continues to surprise me with the failures and triumphs I become a part of and this is with almost 20 games under my belt. 

I still think it&#039;s pointless to play completely coop. I think the connecting symbols between the locations is unclear at first and make it harder to track which path is which.

I&#039;m glad to own it and will continue to play.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s really just an expandable and variable coop with customizable decks, which while the essence of LCG is still something new altogether.

Wonderful new and classic art, great new mechanics, and a blast to play.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Will be widely available, wait on purchase.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Nice little majorities game. Some random elements, yet there is enough strategy to make play measurable. Close games with experienced players might be resolved in luck .....time will tell.

Update:

Another good play after a long hiatus results in the confirmation that this is a 7, but a strong one. If not for a luck based endgame it would likely be an 8.

I wouldn&#039;t play it with any variants as the game isn&#039;t long or heavy enough to warrant it, and experience really evens things out. I suppose you might lose by a point or two because of the chips, but most often you&#039;re going to lose by a goal card or two.</comment>				</item>

Some times it&#039;s simply hoping you make it past a somewhat random early game to get to the heart of the play where the real decisions take place. More often than not, there are smart decisions to be made for the entirety of play and you will often look back and see what you could have done &quot;right&quot; for the next play. Any game you can learn from tells me that the game space has room for you to grow as a player and make intelligent decisions.

Sometimes you&#039;ll get screwed, but most of the time there&#039;s tension and fun. Given the short duration and round structure, the fun is all you&#039;ll remember.</comment>				</item>

This game unsurprisingly has quite a bit in common with Keythedral and Caylus.

Worth a few plays to see if it will stand the test or wear thin.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I remember playing adventure games like Runebound wishing for a decent experience. I think what always killed them was random encounters. Most of those, if not all, are also lifeless dice chuckers.

MK takes deck building and makes it a central mechanic, yet not the entire game. You move, discover, new creatures are put out and you see them from a distance, making planned encounters. You visit locations, and because movement in the game can be fairly liberal, not to mention locations plentiful, there&#039;s little &quot;man it&#039;s going to take me 5 turns to get all the way over there&quot;, it&#039;s more like &quot;I can&#039;t wait to see what&#039;s over here&quot;.

Like any other deck builder you can have some soft turns, but because you can retain cards you can build toward more productive combat or purchasing turns. In the interim there are places you can easily sit for valuable resources or places to go and heal; villages are especially nice for the pillaging, IE extra cards for the next turn.

The game will play in about 45 minutes a player, so it&#039;s not short yet you are always looking forward to your next turn. There are some seriously creative ways to combo cards and you really do ave to think about the best way to use your hand each turn. One of the best things about hand management is that even is you cannot use a card for its face function it can still be used as a one value of one of four functions. 

It&#039;s also wild to see the pacing of the rounds as they are dictated by players. Sometimes you want to burn through your deck to rush other players and harm their progress, other times you&#039;d rather let them end the round (since ending the round means you have to skip a turn). 

My initial rating was an 8. After a 3p, 2p, and a solo I now give it a 9.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This does nothing but add more of everything I liked about the base game. There is a variety of new creatures, abilities, abilities combos, and of course new cards galore. There&#039;s a wonderful new hero, a new solo/coop mode, and more.

As I said, it doesn&#039;t alter the game as much as enhance and complete a game I already thought was complete. I integrated it and will never separate it. Even the color issues (color differences based on which edition you have, and you&#039;ll have some differences no matter what edition you have) it makes no difference; there&#039;s enough new content that you still don&#039;t know what you&#039;re getting or when.

Simply perfect.</comment>				</item>

While this system isn&#039;t totally no-luck (there&#039;s still a 33% chance per die to do no damage), taking the random card play out of the equation is something that&#039;s never been done before. 

The sky really is the limit for this system and I see no reason that this won&#039;t become a 10 for me.</comment>				</item>

While I understand that the theme of the game is about palace builing, the game should not always &quot;force&quot; you to do that as the main action 90% of the time, with the penalty for not doing so being losing.

I am starting to feel a distinct lack of variety and choices in the game.</conditiontext>			</item>

Update:

Years later I come back to this game and while there&#039;s a neat idea here, there are newer outguessing games I enjoy much more; such as Witch&#039;s Brew.

It&#039;s just &quot;outdated&quot; IMHO.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A light, quick and dirty memory game. There&#039;s a bit of luck in the fact that you may or may not choose the same color as another player; the net result being more or less biscuits than others. The game tends to even itself out if you are paying attention though. It&#039;s alot of silly fun, and I&#039;m glad I own a copy.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Mansions is Betrayal at House on the Hill done even better.

I&#039;m personally a fan of Betrayal but have some caveats about the game. Mansions not only applies a theme/universe that I am passionate about but amps up the component quality while reducing the fiddlyness of the entire experience. 

I&#039;m so glad the game intentionally splits setup between the players and the keeps. This reduces front load down time by a large margin. It immediately involves all players. Another element that does this is the way the keep stays the moderator for all cards and puzzles that are revealed, and further the mythos cards that have to be played on the investigators turn; making the keeper highly interested in what the investigators are doing on their turn. 

Turns go by fast generally. The play time is listed as 3-4 hours and our learning game with numerous interruptions was 4. I can easily see this game being a 2 hour experience with our group, which is simply awesome.

I&#039;m not sure how necessary the monster figs are, as they are gigantic, but I simply wouldn&#039;t have the game any other way.

There are complaints about two other things:

Errata: Yep. All FF has it. I don&#039;t have an issue with it. Generally if we cannot find the answer here we all agree on one until we find out the &quot;correct&quot; answer.

Story Telling: There is a story here. It&#039;s all theme. No it doesn&#039;t read like a book, or even play out like a movie, but it does serve to get players involved and they are interested to hear what comes next. The story does get lost while your playing until that next chapter comes up again.

I&#039;m looking forward to expansions for this one in a big way and indeed I also see this rising to a 10.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Preordered B&amp;B 3/18/11</wishlistcomment></item>

I also have to comment that overall the game has the nicest bits of any Mayfair game to date...albeit the design of the money is infantile, and I cannot fathom why they chose florescent purple as a player color.</comment>				</item>

You have the auctioning of the businesses, then the moving of the &quot;customers&quot;, all the while you have to help your opponents to often get equal gain, and other times just keep the customers to yourself. 

I love the experience, I love the relatively short amount of time this game plays in. This is one of my favorite Dorra games ever.</comment>				</item>

The unique thing here is the &quot;tug of war&quot; that the central board represents for scoring. 

I like this one alot, but more plays are needed before I &quot;get it&quot; and can raise it&#039;s score.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Tentative rating after a first play with 5 puts this one on the bubble; we shall see where subsequent plays put it.

It&#039;s a hint of wargame with an interesting majorities mechanic. Really you&#039;re trying to control companies to increase the degree of control you have in various industries. There&#039;s only one possible payout a round, and given that you are only start player 3 times in a game you have to choose your investments wisely. 

Mercenaries are a key to controlling countries, but to be honest there seemed to be less value in controlling the countries than simply trying to bribe your way into positions. 

There&#039;s a good bit of old school feel here and though our inaugural game was 2.5 hours I can see that time reducing significantly with subsequent plays, and honestly it never felt as long as it did.</comment>				</item>

This could almost be called Justinian the card game even though they are from different designers. 

I have enjoyed the 5 or 6 plays that we&#039;ve had of this one, and hope to play it again soon.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s as thought FF took Pirates Cove and said &quot;let&#039;s up the ante&quot;. 

Fantastic production and multiple paths to gain coin and upgrades. Really just super fun without too much complexity.

Absolutely nothing there that shouldn&#039;t be.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Rules are amazing. Definitely purchase.</wishlistcomment></item>

Dutch auction with countdown clock. Press your luck game with the card draws. Fairly calculable benefit/loss system. Opportunities to spite opponents to get ahead. 

Cons:

Clock can lead to &quot;who hit it first&quot;. Cards are fairly random and not alway beneficial to the current player.

I see this game as a predecessor to games like Ys and Endeavor yet still different enough and relevant enough for an occasional play. It certainly needs the right group, however.</comment>				</item>

At first you have this total random mess of a game. What you don&#039;t realize is that your first goals should be to gather bonus cards and building cards to determine which contracts are most important to you.

Evaluating which contracts are worth retaining for continues revenue generation combined with timely culling of the chaff will allow you to collect further bonus and building cards. 

In the end it was rather surprisingly strategic, though your strategy starts to materialize mid game, yet there is still plenty of time to see them to fruition. You simply have to ensure that while you try to maximize building cards that you continually evolve your contracts for the maximum points at the end of the game.

It&#039;s also surprisingly short. It was 90 minutes including rules explanation for our first play. So Uwe has returned to a reasonable play time again.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>It&#039;s a Ewe game. I&#039;ve liked all his stuff to date. Definitely worth a look.

Uses time as a resource, emphasizes efficiency and ladder building of contracts.

Ordered on Funagain.

Update:

Funagain no longer importing as they are waiting for domestic distribution; cancelled from order.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Nothing in here that wowed me. It was a nice pick up and deliver game, but not the best I&#039;ve played. The game has very nice production values (all the way down to using real rocks for the stone). 

Update: More plays...more strategy. It&#039;s all in how the tiles come out. Strategy can vary wildly in this game, and playing it more was what the doctor ordered.

Update:

Played again and had 3 players who could not win based on how the tiles came out so the game virtually locked up for 3 of us. 

It will get another play to see if it can save itself from the trade pile.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Rating based on one play of the family rules.

While I enjoy the auction mechanism, this is really all the game is, and requires people to think and play quickly to keep the game interesing. Further, the full game will have several layers of depth, but without expedient play I can see this one becoming stagnant, and people becoming relucant to play.

I like the base ideas and enjoyed this, but if people try to play it more &quot;thinky&quot; it might not be worth the time.

Update:

Doesn&#039;t really play much differently with the full rules versus family rules. I&#039;m thinking there&#039;s not a whole lot fo game here...</comment>				</item>

Ignore the comparisons to Fairy Tale and El Grande. Yes it has majorities, and yes it has drafting (a great part of this game).

Update:

After a couple years&#039; hiatus a 5 player game was instigated, and it continued the tension. I think after having played so many different games that the strategy is more obvious than my first plays, however the competition combined with the drafting mechanism make this fun as long as people don&#039;t over think their moves.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;ve read the variants and after having played with less than 4 players I really have no interest in ever doing it again.

That being said, Mines is a very neat little game of blind bidding, efficiency, and combo building. There are some interesting choices to make and a few tactical maneuvers to be had.

There is stiff competition in the form of Furstenfeld here; it both scales better and plays just as quickly.

I will give this game at least a couple of more plays to see if it will sink or swim. I think if it could get down to the 30-40 minute play time range that it definitely has a place in my collection, otherwise it will likely find a home with someone else.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Mission Red Planet takes the role system from a game like Citadels, crosses that idea with the action selection mechanism from a game like Race for the Galaxy, and then has you taking control of regions and scoring points at set intervals just like in El Grande. Throw in a deck of bonuses (which has a smattering of &quot;chaos&quot; cards&quot;) and you have a game that&#039;s 70% strategy and 30% luck. It plays very well if you don&#039;t over think it. Our group played it in an hour including a brief explanation.

Worth playing again, and certainly as the filler-like game that most people describe it as. This was a 4 player game and certainly I think that 5 players would up the chaos level, but again its&#039; such a short game you probably won&#039;t care.</comment>				</item>

The Good: Blissfully fast and reminiscent of a themed Toss Up.

The Bad: Totally random and not really a game; more of a &quot;take turns rolling the dice and see who hits x points first&quot;.</comment>				</item>

The more I play it the more I like it. this one is best played with 5; but meaning that the more players the better. It&#039;s awesome with any number.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The flip dice system is brilliant!

It&#039;s fast, furious, and fun. The best part of this game lies in the fact that you don&#039;t have to count out your optimal move like many other racers.

The modular track system makes this fantastic, and I can even see tons of room for house rules to add depth if we ever wanted to.

The system allows for real back and forth battles, and plays VERY quickly with little down time between turns.

It&#039;s light, that&#039;s sure enough, so more hardcore racer fans probably won&#039;t be satisfied; but this one will fit in to most gamer&#039;s scope of acceptance.

Update:

Rating rises 1 point after racing on a more complex track with full rules and more players.</comment>				</item>

I love the maximum speed, the imposed penalties, the timers, the &quot;a die played is a die laid&quot; rule, and the wonderful cars.

It&#039;s a light game of random draws and minimal strategy. You can however make some very clever plays and it&#039;s so short that it&#039;s worth playing.

It&#039;s certainly different in play and theme from anything else.</comment>				</item>

But now that we have I can say that this can definately be a tough game for either player. I had originally thought that the Jack player had it worst, but now I see that it&#039;s just that the Jack player has to learn &quot;the ways of the force&quot;. I also see that the Detective player must be aggressive.

This one&#039;s a winner in my book, and I&#039;m definitely glad I was able to get a copy.</comment>				</item>

They maintain the seen/unseen mechanism for elimination of suspects. They maintain the 1-2-1 rotation of actions each turn.

The kicker is that while it&#039;s a bit more abstract the game has the same feel and comes in at a 15-20 minute play time!

Great new Mr. Jack. I&#039;d have never thunk it.</comment>				</item>

I can say the following:

- It plays in about an hour
- It&#039;s abstract
- It&#039;s good, but unless a second play impresses me more, I&#039;d say there are other Reiner games I&#039;d rather play. Like I said, it was one play, and with 5. Good, not great.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s still not quite the &quot;Antiquity Light&quot; that some elluded to, but I&#039;m actually glad for that. For sure there&#039;s the constant cycling economy, only tenuously comparible to Antiquity, but the other elements simply don&#039;t match up to much else. 

One thing is for sure, this game is not only thematic but it beats the pants off the last attempt at making an Ant colony game. </comment>				</item>

It&#039;s an action point system that uses card peeks and passes to gather information and then &quot;deduce&quot; the 4 of the 5 major factors of the murder.

The &quot;controversial&quot; time element, which is actually quite less difficult to manage that others would have you believe.</comment>				</item>

On the gameplay side, this game has quite a number of things going for it, including the tongue in cheek humor. I also like the fine balance of luck and strategy. There are even elements to help even out the luck.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m totally uncertain about how Mr. Gherdts does it. It&#039;s yet a totally new take on using the rondel, or at least building a game around it. 

It&#039;s essentially set collection and each set on your personal tableau gives additive bonuses to the sets of buildings and colony tiles you collect. The buildings also expand other abilities on the rondel as your sets of them burgeon in size.

The sugar, gold, and spice &quot;shacks&quot; are used in conjunction with the colonies to either sell good and devalue the market or the shacks serve to revalue it; either way you can make great money and careful diversification is necessary. 

I was hesitant and perhaps future plays will show it has some sort of limited staying power but the game was competitive and tense throughout, all players saw the other forks in the road they could have taken, and in all everyone agree about how good it was.

It&#039;s easily the second best in the series but could just as easily grow to be my favorite.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>I remain skeptical of a new use of the rondel from this designer. I think I&#039;m officially tired of collecting them from him.

UPDATE:

Played and loved the damn thing. I LOVE being wrong ;)</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is a game of random chance. You try to get cards into play, the powers and values of which are random, which the higher valued ones almost always being preferable (given that 20 points ends the game). Your investments can pay out variably, higher to those who are somewhat luckier with what their neighbors do and when that luck aligns with what is in their hand the the order of the actions they just have happened to take.

There&#039;s not much of a game here. You play, collect, and there&#039;s likely to be a couple of people close in score at the end. Someone will definitely win, but most will lose, simply for having played.</comment>				</item>

Ignacy does it again with a 2.0 of another design, really a 2.5, and makes a great game perfect.

This version has extreme balance across the board, more comboliciousness, and a wonderful new faction.

They claim you can combine both games but I say WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO??</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Turn the stack from Magic into a fully featured, highly interactive game. It also borrows the kicker mechanic from Magic but evolves that as well.

That might seem like two strikes against it but the designer has taken those ideas and elevated them to such a degree that the game is surprisingly unique and plays well.

Much like Dominion or Thunderstone, there is a ton of information to absorb on the front end and will take multiple plays to bring the play time down to a reasonable length. Luckily even initial plays do not feel as long as they actually are. 

Hopefully a few solid expansions will flesh out the system and it will be a contender to the Dominion throne in our group.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Set collection and a bit of take-that card play; but with a twist on the take-that.

Even though there is a wealth of card stealing and forced bidding, you always get a card in exchange; making the actions risky at times.

There are opportunities for keeping track of cards gained as well as seeing player hands.

While it&#039;s random our games have been rather close. It really needs to be played briskly for maximum enjoyment.

Finally, I cannot see playing this with more than 4-5 players.</comment>				</item>

The rest of us will find Small World for advanced players with a pseudo tech-tree; the tree is randomized but only in the costs that you&#039;ll pay and given that the available board spaces change each game there is a great amount of variability in each play.

It uses the time mechanism from Neuland/Jenseits to magnificent effect. I especially like that each player has their own separate end game trigger (timing not condition) and that they immediately get one last turn; though they sacrifice bonus points to do so. There seems to be some room for brilliant timing decisions here.

A total surprise.</comment>				</item>

The AP mechanism is Neuland/Tinners. Blind Bids turn into an equal amount of budget for the round. These are your AP&#039;s. Whomever has spent the least (top and left most) goes next).

There is set collection like Traum where you build sets of composers, though no duplicate composers are allowed. There are multiple ways to score them, either combined or individually, and even a few ways to make extra cash from them. The interesting thing about the tableaus the composer tiles are placed on is that they are expandable, and this expansion is another way to get VP&#039;s.

The major mechanism for action spending is through role selection and other players can &quot;play along&quot;; though they have to buy in unlike Puerto.

Solid game. Could really grow on me and my group.

Further play lowers this one to a 6. The main reason is the wild swings in possible vp values in the composer market. I also think the the actions and opera houses force too much overlap and interconnection to the point where you could unintentionally or intentionally affect other players, perhaps all 3 of your opponents simultaneously. It leads to a &quot;I don&#039;t want to do that action&quot; syndrome that takes away quite a bit of the game for me.

I&#039;m also not happy with how long it plays, or at least how long it feels like it&#039;s taking.</comment>				</item>

My head is still spinning from the velocity at which this game accelerates into a conclusion!

Lots of interesting combos happening, interesting timing, still working out if screw

8 plays:

(1) 2 Player
(3) 3 Player
(4) 4 Player

I think the 4 player strategy is keyed toward getting the most Complex and Simple with the chance of winning on a lucky Amino, however the game length is so much shorter I believe the former is the key to consistent victory.

Timing is the key to 3 player games using much of the ideas of 4 player however there is a much higher chance for an Amino to happen.

The two player game is wide open. It seems to me that the world is your oyster and that you can be more focused on building toward the Amino win, and moreover should likely always work toward that end with two players.</comment>				</item>

There are some important decision points, that while not varied, do have a big impact on each round. We used to have 2 minute games and now some stretch to 10. That doesn&#039;t sound like a lot, but when you&#039;re talking a cousin of blackjack, suddenly there&#039;s a real game here.

There are a TON of variants to try...eventually.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Kickstarted - Due August 2014</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Rating started out at 6, as I felt it a bit simple and mediocre, repeating many familiar mechanics. But the more I played it, the more I realized just how wonderfully tuned and blanaced the game was, and just how many tough decisions there are to make. Every play makes this one better, and while it may not be a 10, or even a 9, it is solid an 8 as any other game as I have rated an 8; perhaps even closer to 9 (but I don&#039;t do fractional ratings). Good production values and a lower price point make Alhambra&#039;s long lost sibling a winner in my book.</comment>	<conditiontext>Gently Used: For Trade or Best Cash Offer</conditiontext>			</item>

I also like that losing, while it sucks, makes you just as fulfilled as a win might; though wins in this game are hard-fought, so they&#039;re even better.

I&#039;m not saying we should have Legacy everything, but I&#039;m glad they took something other than Risk and ported it into this mechanic. I really hope they do a season 2.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>To me, The Cure is almost equivalent to the original. The feel and tension are all there. It&#039;s a bit more abstracted, but it still plays essentially the same. 

The big change is the decision making. While all of the information is out in the original game, the dice make this one so much more dynamic. Decisions do not come as easily, and often they have a much higher price when you make the wrong one. I also like that since the board state changes so often there is much more discussion of strategy, and indeed more real decision space.

I REALLY like it. 

Update:

Same opinion after a dozen plays. </comment>				</item>

The only wrinkle, and the one I won by, was that of the removed businesses. I&#039;m sure you could track that information, but in a game this light why should you have to, and more to the point why should a close game be decided by such an arbitrary mechanism. 

The game is light, fast, and some what of a light deduction experience. Purchased cheaply and played briskly I suppose it is worth it but it fits the same time frame as Chine or Web of Power. I can see the origins of both of those games here, but given that I own them I would default to them.</comment>				</item>

Overall our first play was quite even, and in future, will surely end before the end of the 3rd year.</comment>				</item>

We now never play without all the expansions and by the variant &quot;6 tiles dealt&quot; rules, allowing for one or more tiles to always be in the conquest area.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a game of hand management coupled with pick up and deliver. While the game has some randomness, it&#039;s no more so than my other fav Kosmos 2p Jambo. It actually has exactly the same level of strategy, tactics and luck as Jambo, so if you&#039;re a fan I couldn&#039;t recommend this one more. 

One thing: Either the sun should be smaller or the player tokens should have been some sort of plastic bit or cube, not a ship shaped chit.</comment>				</item>

The board could have been simplified...the art is over the top like Colosseum and Sienna. I could have also done without paying the extra 5 buck in wood for the cathedral.

I think it&#039;s easy to enjoy this game for what it is, and that&#039;s just a silly little game that&#039;s good with a full boat of players. It&#039;s kinda like playing chicken...only with Pedro.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>How utterly disappointing. While the flavor of this game&#039;s inspiration, Robo Rally, is there, the unfortunate part is that the dice REALLY detract from your experience. While the cards in RR can screw you there are still a ton of board elements that help you make something of the lemons you&#039;ve been handed. It just seems to me that in this game a bad roll is far worse than a bad hand.

The other negative for us was the take-that elements of denying a chosen action or forcing another to use yours. This makes it FAR too easy to mess with each other&#039;s plans and to make it worse it&#039;s hard to pull off your intended foil. You normally foil them doing something you didn&#039;t expect and then their altered movement will negatively effect you.

After an hour of going around in circles during our last game I think this one is a complete dud.</comment>				</item>

There&#039;s a different technique you have to use, and while perhaps I&#039;d like heavier cars I think it&#039;s just a matter getting a feel for how much lighter you have to be to get the same effect on the cars. 

Most of our players were getting equal performance to that of the full size version in a matter of a lap or two.

I like this every bit as much as the full scale and it&#039;s totally portable!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>There was a time when I said &quot;No More Coops, I have too many&quot;, then they started making coops like this. 

Police Precinct, in many ways, reminds me of Arkham Horror. Random events or challenges pop up to be dealt with, some with a built in timer imposing negative consequences unless addressed. In fact, the game makes you plan well, coordinate well, and be proactive at all times.

Tension is high throughout, players are always engaged, and certainly the theme rises above what seems like a boring old cop game. 

I own the 2nd edition, whose production values are second to none. If you&#039;re a coop lover, definitely look into this game.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Kickstarted, due fall 2014, stated as before Essen</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The maps feel like variants. Because of that, and the unimpressive Europe side, this is an 8.

New Art Direction: I can take or leave the minimalist approach. I&#039;m not sure why the radical shift.

New Wood: The resources are great but the dynamos make me have to explain what they are to every new player. They should have just been factory shapes.

I like the variant with the 1; it really shakes the later game up. The extra space for Europe? Waste of time. Perhaps it shortens the game by a round? </comment>				</item>

Spain/Portugal creates a slower game of drudgery and drops a handful of eco plants late game at a crucial time that serves to harm those trailing and further slow the game down. This is the pack of maps that convinced me that I don&#039;t need any more for PG and I especially never need to play Spain/Portugal again EVER.</comment>				</item>

Those things being said you end up with an above average game that is worth playing on occasion. Played quickly enough it does contain enough tactics and variety to make it intense and fun. 

It&#039;s not destined to be a regular once everyone has had a shot at it; that&#039;s because Peloponnes does everything here a bit better, and is more popular in my group, though everyone still &quot;enjoys&quot; PGFM.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is the essence of PG with a simplified auction and more emphasis on turn order.

In many ways this game feels like more of an economic engine than the original, and the knowledge cards create some light strategy avenues.

While the original is the best this is certainly worthwhile for fans of the game; it&#039;s lightning fast at a mere 45 minutes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I think the luck of the dice can spoil things a bit, and in a given race there can be a real runaway leader problem. It&#039;s tough to play quickly as things can change radically before your next turn.

It&#039;s very abstract, but solid. 

Update:

While an amusing racer other games such as Moto GP, RallyMan, and especially Das Motorsportspeil simply outshine it and my desire to play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Another of this seasons games that has a high degree of randomness that&#039;s completely manageable. I think competent decision making is derived from small number of cards in the game and the fact that there is perfect information among the players themselves.

Pret teaches you to focus on a handful of scoring categories and specialize in your buildings and employees to be successful. Failure to do so will not only see you lose but struggle throughout the game. In the latter sense Pret can be very brutal and unforgiving.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m a bit torn about this one. Everyone, including my self was engaged by the variety of decisions and the sheer timing challenges involved in Princes. The whole game was tense, and in all there seems to be a ton of strategy.

It seems that running the sacrifice deck out isn&#039;t too difficult, which mitigates my major concern of the Spanish showing up and giving the random tripling or doubling of someone&#039;s score my pure venom toward the game.

Indeed the goal of a player who is ahead is to get priests/virgins, get 4+ cards, manipulate their pieces to fit those cards and run the deck out FTW.

Tentative 7 until I find out if my feelings are correct. Could easily be an 8, but I suspect the random element keeps it a solid, enjoyable 7; even if the game is a tad long for my tastes.</comment>				</item>

This game has so many layers and so many approaches to victory; Will you collect vp tiles and devalue the status chart? Will you go military and collect laurels and command the status chart? How about using the pope to your own ends to guide &quot;fate&quot;? There are so many approaches...This game is underrated, but I suspect it has a lot to do with it&#039;s heavy nature, longer play time, and lack of availability.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo/Tetris Attack the deckbuilder.

Your goal is to make at least one other opponents accumulate 10+ penalty points to end the game then have the least among all other players. The deck building is more subtle, you buy fewer tiles, often having singles that simply enhance your goals or that will give you a quick leg up when they appear. The radical change, and what drives your game, are the 3 character specific tiles you receive; not only thematic but creating completely different strategies for all involved.

I have yet to do 2p, but I have the upgrade pack for the &quot;balanced&quot; characters and play by 3rd edition rules for free for alls. 

If you&#039;ve ever wanted some confrontation in your deck buiilder, this is the one for you; pink box et al be damned.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Starts at a tentative 7. I&#039;m currently an addict which is more than I can say for some of my 7&#039;s or some even more highly rated, however I have had and seen a couple of people have HORRIBLE games.

It is dice and my bad luck is down to 1 in 5 games; now I see other possibilities that have helped negate it. I also think the game plays better with less than 4, but time will tell.</comment>				</item>

The Good: For a limited number of plays you can outguess and out play your opponent in this abstract.

The Bad: Moves eventually become obvious and the game loses it&#039;s charm and playability.</comment>				</item>

The Good: Totally unique, visually appealing, lends itself to a few strategies.

The Bad: Runaway leader can spoil the game more often than not more than half way through.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is the best dice multiplayer dice game of this style that you can play. It&#039;s tense, fun, and I actually don&#039;t care about winning or losing; I just love seeing if the gambles you take every turn pan out.

It&#039;s like Ra in feel and much in function yet still keeps it&#039;s own identity. Reiner has also done a great job of mitigating the penalties that could have been associated with the suns or ankhs. 

5 plays in less than a week of ownership says it all, and that&#039;s with all numbers; so it scales beautifully to boot.</comment>				</item>

It has no real player interaction, but then again most of the experience of this game is simply to do it better than anyone else.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The cards are still more random than I care for, but I like the game quite a bit without the tycoon cards. I still prefer chocolate over vanilla though.

Update: 

Rating drops from an 8 to a 6 as I&#039;ve never wanted to play it again since the first two times.</comment>				</item>

The real bluffing here is claiming there are no rats, which is incredibly thematic. Worth every penny for this cheap game.</comment>				</item>

One player got the surprise win with a kiss, though otherwise the game was very competitive and close.

The rules are somewhat wanting until you have played half a game then everything is clear.

I certainly like the bullying aspect and the shoving mechanic.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>What a surprise this game is. Once you get past the Cleopatara-level chrome, there&#039;s quite a good game underneath.

It&#039;s a logistical exercise of trying to juggle increasing your movement, collecting bonuses, and setting up the collection of relics; the latter of which you&#039;d normally like to be at antother player&#039;s expense.

What you end up with is something a bit more brain burny than DoW has ever produced. I suspect the sweet spot will be 4, though a cut throat 5 player game will be fun as well.</comment>				</item>

An amazing little game that deftly combines the card play from BSG and the human interplay from Werewolf in an effective manner.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Will likely buy. Waiting for final rules. Might still do a basic PnP to make final decision.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>While I will say that this game concludes quickly enough for &quot;what it is&quot;, and further the guessing game does seem to have some valid tactics, it&#039;s still a guessing game that&#039;s better implemented first in Witch&#039;s Brew, and perhaps also in Castle for All Seasons.

Not worth buying, but an occasional play would be fine.

Update:

I began thinking more and more about this game and bought it. The thing is it&#039;s actually a fine game. It&#039;s got some interesting and at times exciting out guessing.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>There&#039;s alot to like in this game. It&#039;s card driven, and while there is luck inherent ot a system like that, every card is unique, and the deck gets reshuffled fairly often, so those cards get reused. I also like the &quot;destruction tile-esque&quot; bastions, that can screw with other people. The archbishop function is nice, and adds another element to broaden the spectrum of this game.</comment>				</item>

If you can handle the 3 factors above then this is certainly for you.

It&#039;s really about choosing a path of terrain tiles + power tiles + some city tiles, while making sure to get a piece of the action on the main board; the latter of which is important to help garner timely resource markers and money and can also be a serious source of points.

The only negative is TIME. Our first game went four hours. I could see this getting down to 2.5-3 at best. I&#039;m uncertain that it will see frequent play due this factor alone, but it certainly won&#039;t go untouched.</comment>				</item>

For one: You must play this game with the intent of trying to eliminate each other (optional rule).

Two: There are some odd situations that can end in uneven pacing and an overly long game.

Fer Three: Doesn&#039;t play so well with 5-6.

The rule book is also a mess.

I do love the idea that this is a smattering of Car Wars and the best of Carmageddon.

Edit:

Gone, baby, gone. I guess future contenders like Road/Kill or the reprint of Car Wars will perhaps suffice.</comment>				</item>

Our first game was 4 hours including the rules explanation for 4 players. I agree with our teacher that more than 4 would take a serious commitment from all involved and the understanding that you may be looking at 1-1.5 hours more per player.

It&#039;s a game everyone should play at least once, though it&#039;s arguable which is better between this and Antiquity. They&#039;re different offerings, so it&#039;s really hard to play favorites.

One final thought is that I would probably have been more taken with the game had I not seen further plays take 5 hours; and another factor is having played other pick up and deliver games before this one, all of which are much shorter and nearly as satisfying.

I just wish it didn&#039;t take an hour for this game to really get going.</comment>				</item>

The game also leans toward making it easier to hit, than to miss, so every round is full of success. Even the Kraken and Sea Dragon, though brutal, are thrilling.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Kickstarted: Due July 2015</wishlistcomment></item>

Rune Age is like:

- Night Fall in that each player has personal draft piles

- LotR the LCG in that you choose a scenario which has goals and sets the central draft piles

- Thunderstone in that you have a main deck that brings out enemies and events

That being said it plays like none of them. It&#039;s a 30 minute game full of fast play and neat combos. 

Pluses:

- Awesome art

- Scenarios range from non interactive competition to fully pvp

- There are 4 factions each with their own style and unique draft piles

- Quick set up and break down 

I think the game fills the same kind of filler niche as Dominion but while taking the best of many of its fore runners RA remains a beast all it&#039;s own. </comment>				</item>

While it has much less luck that it&#039;s cousin Formula De, there is still a significant level of luck in the lane changes. 

The big positive is that your speed is dictated by your position. This is coupled with the fact that you choose your level of risk in terms of lane changes associated with your given speed. You also have quite a few more points to augment speed, shifts, and changes than it&#039;s cousin, though this is somewhat deceiving as one major blunder can leave you hurting and basically remove you from contention.

I&#039;m still interested in playing more and those plays will either confirm or deny my feelings.

Finally: Why the hell couldn&#039;t there be either multicolored cars OR cars that you can intermix colored components that ACTUALLY STAY TOGETHER? I know the colors are teams, but this isn&#039;t really a team game.

Feelings confirmed: Random mess with a runaway leader issue.</comment>	<conditiontext>Played twice. Original inserts included. Like New.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>More an evolution than revolution, yet it&#039;s a tight design loaded with tense moments. There are multiple scoring avenues to persue in a myriad of combinations, none of which seem to be best. 

The actual worker placement is the star and it&#039;s handled brilliantly. Engineer allow you to add to your personal options, they also serve as a revolving futures market that is shared for a time. 

One thing is for sure: Make sure you manage your turn order or you will regret it.

Update: Another play and it&#039;s a 9.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is an all auction game with a centralized board for player interaction. Many have panned it for just being a series of auctions but the central board holds a subtle majorities game. I think that the underexposure this might have gotten when it was released meant that when most people had a chance to play it there were &quot;more interesting&quot; games out there...however I still enjoyed the heck out of it.

The only other games that I love that are also in this category are Modern Art and Fist of Dragonstones.</comment>				</item>

Much lighter than most, barely heavier than Ave Caesar by all accounts, and with the same luck level, but more opportunity for tactics.

You can certainly see that ti&#039;s the cast off of Snow Tails, and will likely live in the shadow of that great game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s fast paced trivia, and sometimes the trivia is based on video or visual cues from the dvd included. They have included a folding board that lets you play the long or short version of the game as well. Novel, entertaining, and fun...just not hard or original. I would rate this a 7 or 8, but it is possible for someone to win having only anwered just one question. (on your turn you roll and move, then take a question and repeat this until you get one wrong, or in a special case until everyone beats you to the answer. You move at the beginning of each turn no matter what. So with good rolls, you can beat everyone to the end, having answered no questions right, and just answer your last question right for the win...on the rare side, but happened to us and is very lame)</comment>				</item>

If you like superheroes, a game full of flavor and theme, and tons of replayability then I cannot recommend this more. The base set is a 9 but expansion content makes it a 10.</comment>				</item>

All in all a fantastic new way to play. I cannot wait to see what variants people come up with to use these villains in other ways.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Kickstarted - Due October 2013 - Now delayed until February 2014</wishlistcomment></item>

Vengeance added quite a bit of play time using that variant, while some aspects of this expansion add a ton of book keeping (I&#039;m looking at you Bloodsworn Colloseum and titles).

I think with the advent, and backstory, of Progenitor, that I&#039;d like to see a 1 vs many setup, perhaps with a Galactus clone with Progenitor at his side.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s not a game for everyone, but I think it would see at least occasional play in most groups. It&#039;s definately best played in a full boat, ensuring one of you will be the traitor. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>WOW. This is one major lake of choices and options.

While the end game goals are significant they do seem balanced so far. There is a seemingly unending number of ways to accumulated points and bonuses, though overall you do have to obey your end game contracts in order to win.

While there are 5 rondels, there is truely only one, though it&#039;s much more complex than any other that has come before; the selectable actions move to the &quot;front of the line&quot; changing their order, affecting availability, and finally serve as a timer for each round - PHEW!!

The other 4 rondels are neutral, and while you have to be mindful of them to time your primary actions from the main rondel properly, they are not something you control in a way as to thwart other players.

This is truly a game of efficiency, organization, and impeccable timing.

Looking forward to MANY more plays. The only down side to this game is time (2-3 hours, 30-40 minutes to explain the rules properly), and the 4 player cap (thank god it cannot play more :) )

More thoughts:

It&#039;s a tough call but I have to give Shipyard the nod this month. I&#039;m a sucker for a rondel and this game has FIVE OF THEM.

They&#039;re not quite rondels in the way we think. Really it&#039;s all about the main rondel and simply timing the actions on it with the position of the neutral markers on the &quot;sub-rondels&quot;. You can pay to move the &quot;sub-rondies&quot; further along, so in a way I [i]guess[/i] they are more akin to the &quot;traditional&quot; rondel....enough of the quotations already. The main rondel has actions that correspond to each of the other sub-rondels as well as 3 other piles (ship pieces, map pieces, train cars). After people move off of a space they chose in a previous turn this space ROTATES TO THE FRONT OF THE ROW! You cannot choose the action again (though there&#039;s a way to buy an extra action each turn to break this rule). There are a limited number of spaces on the main rondel and once the action spaces have advanced full circle it triggers the start of the next round.

Pile on the fact that there is ship building, then sailing said ships on a test run when they are completed, and even further that the ships have features on them (life preservers, lanterns, etc) printed on them plus ones you can manually add (different types of crew and passengers, masts, etc), and also also wik that the tiles that you use to create your route to sail contain triggers for some of said multipliers.

The real crux of this game is the fact that you start with 2 contracts in each of 2 groups/colors. At one point you have to choose one of each group. These contracts have conditional VP on them as well that score at game end.

It is long, tough, heavy, complex, and not easy to learn....but SO worth it if you&#039;re into heavy games and/or the rondel.</comment>				</item>

The new maps are wonderful, the clear base on the cube tower makes it easy to see what came out without hovering over it, and the new turn order system isn&#039;t half bad either.If you have Wallenstien this isn&#039;t a must-buy, and if you don&#039;t it is.</comment>				</item>

That&#039;s all there is to it though. Roll over and over until you shut the box. I can see how this was a drinking game as there is little reason to play it unless you want something to amuse you as you drink yourself silly.

Fun in limited doses.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is essentially Civ Revolution translated into board game form.

While I&#039;ve read comments as to &quot;why would you do that?&quot; I would say this: There are a number of major elements that are different enough to say this is a different experience albeit heavily derivative of the source material. Further the human interaction in the game makes any comparison impossible.

There truly is the diversity of choices and strategy with just enough randomness in the system to create a new experience with every play, requiring changes in strategy every time.

Expect initial plays to be in the four hour range though I expect that to drop dramatically with experience, weighing in at 45 minutes a player at the utmost.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Keeping a close eye on this. Kevin Wilson says it&#039;s primarily built on the Revolution idea. Articles detailing the game sound promising.

Will be widely available. Wait on purchase.

Update: Purchased.</wishlistcomment></item>

Long term strategies can be developed that can help counteract a bit of the luck, but you never know when nearby mines will come up, and the passenger routes suffer from the same &quot;randomness...though there at least less of those. The game also has very little player interaction, and has a very sllloooww plodding pace.</comment>				</item>

The racial and special power combinations really make this one fascinating. Further the scalable nature of the game via the different board sizes for each number of players make this game play the same regardless of how many are playing it.

What we have here is Vinci; Vinci with a pile more chrome and features, with very little extra weighing it down. Our first plays were VERY tight, and everyone involved really liked this.</comment>				</item>

This game has some serious synergy across the board, pays fast, and interesting things are always happening. I can&#039;t wait to see the expansions.</comment>				</item>

If I had played it first, I might actually have passed on this. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This game really does feel like soccer and with the minimum of rules. It&#039;s fairly random but there&#039;s still some strategy to how to place your pawns and some general odds estimation.

The rules aren&#039;t totally terrible but the player aid certainly serves to crystallize your understanding. I know this company had a bad reputation for bad behavior in the past but denying yourself the experience for that reason is a disservice to your gaming ID.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This game is just plain fun, and I think it&#039;s furthered by the fact that there are training missions that baby step you up to the full game; without which it could be a VERY frustrating experience.

Yes it&#039;s chaotic; if you&#039;re not a fan of programmed movement a-la Robo Rally stay away, or of coop games this is definitely not for you. But we played 4 times in a row and did all of the training and found we wanted to play more and more, regardless of the increasing obstacles.

There&#039;s a vast variety of things you can do, and thankfully you can freely converse and plan, and on occasion trade cards.

This one is oozing with theme, magnificent bits, and plenty of fun.

I would certainly say that this one deserves 4-5 players for best effect.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played at Prezcon &#039;06 at the Cafe Games booth. High quality, well tested design from this young new designer. I look forward to buying my copy when it&#039;s finally released. You owe it to yourself to try this game. It&#039;s a pick up and deliver game at it&#039;s core, with a smattering of logistics and set collection thrown in. Add a few twists I&#039;ve never seen in any other game, and you&#039;ve got a winner. Expect to hear ALOT about this game.

Update: 

Years later its finally released, we finally play more, and remember why we liked it so much. This remains an 8,
And a joy to play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A somewhat straight-forward set collection game. There are opportunities to try and foil others&#039; plans, or protect your own, but I suspect equal player skill would lead to some games boiling down to luck of the draw.

It&#039;s fast enough, and interesting enough, for now.</comment>				</item>

The Good: Knizia&#039;s name is on the box

The Bad: A singular mechanic does not a game make. Make it a random one and you have very little game.</comment>	<conditiontext>Like New: For Trade or Best Cash Offer</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This one is teetering on the edge for me. I honestly enjoy playing, however, there are some minor issues:

- Being the spy and going first. It&#039;s incredibly difficult even if you are experienced with social games like this one.

- The roles are amusing, but honestly I wonder if they really add anything to the game?

- Some of the locations are a bit bizarre, and can lead to seriously uneven, or unfun, results.

So far I&#039;ve liked most of my plays, but I&#039;m not so sure everyone has. Time will tell.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>When I first read about Spyrium I was interested but hesitant simply because it seemed like a novel mechanic and not much else. Color me impressed after my first play.

As the game develops you have several major avenues of vp generation and within each there are multiple combinations. This alone kept my interest, but it&#039;s the further tension and pressure of the worker placement mechanism, what I thought was the lone novel mechanic, was what really helped tie everything togethers. It&#039;s not just a vehicle but a true strategic element.

What I think I like the most is that the game is uncluttered; it&#039;s unfettered by the other layers of false strategy some games try to pile on in the name of complexity (I&#039;m looking at you Vinhos).

I REALLY like this one. Way to go William, way to go.</comment>				</item>

Sure you can duck out of a building after you stack it too high, but it&#039;s still a guessing game as to which building to jump to next. 1 play was enough to convince me that while I enjoyed the stacking, there&#039;s no market in my collection for this game.

The Good: [i]Minor[/i] dexterity game

The Bad: Not much more interesting here than the stacking and subsequent toppling of towers</comment>	<conditiontext>Like New: For Trade or Best Cash Offer</conditiontext>			</item>

The issue I have is play time. It needs to be MUCH faster otherwise even the theme cannot save it. I would also like to test the hypothesis that the first to get a ship wins; I do not believe that to be true.

Update:

While still as luck driven as Thunderstone&#039;s dungeon deck, the exploration deck NEVER screws you even when someone can benefit greatly from lucky draws. Then again, the person who explores the most will win. It&#039;s an interesting push your luck element that I enjoy. 

The play time also came down to 40 minutes! 

Finally, two players got ships early and one of them won. Yes you must get a ship to win. Yes you should learn to build your deck well to get one. No it&#039;s not &quot;broken&quot; like the forums intimate.

I&#039;m going to keep playing it :) Rating rises to a 7.</comment>				</item>

There are cards that I miss from the base game but that I do not want to diminish the value of the new content. I really like the new cards in their entirety and certainly this game feel more focused on maneuvers which I thought was a weaker link in the original. The biggest change is the space deck which feels more varied, fair, and forgiving, making the game more fun overall.

If you liked the original then there is more to like here.</comment>				</item>

The theme is no more useful to this game than it would be for Monopoly, but the character twist, while not a necessity, would have been nice as a stand-alone for the original game.

That all being said: This is my go-to Settlers.</comment>				</item>

There&#039;s a TON of potential here, it&#039;s just a shame that more of it wasn&#039;t in the box to begin with.

Update:

More plays, rating rises to 8</comment>				</item>

There are also some very basic things that you can do wrong in the early game due to inexperience that can make the game MUCH longer than it should be. It&#039;s still likely pushing two hours regardless of experience however.

I enjoyed the first play with all it&#039;s wondrous bits and crazy encounters, playing with 4 (3p first game) will tell me where this one truly lies.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s got some chaos, but when the game ended, there was little to feel cheated about and no one thought the game overstayed it&#039;s welcome. Initial plays are wrought with downtime, as the puzzle aspect of this game will certainly generate a wealth of AP.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s the finer timing points and tweaks that win or lose you the game and there is enough game here that you could spend time teasing out those details. The issue I have is that there is SO much that&#039;s obvious that I lose interest and I&#039;m ready for the game to end. 

The game is also artificially close. Unless someone is playing VERY poorly your games will certainly be won by a close margin.</comment>				</item>

Update: More plays mean that this one IS as great as the original. It&#039;s every bit as nail biting and pulse pounding. I cannot wait to use the original maps with the new system.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s a crazy mash-up and works really well. Others have said it doesn&#039;t feel like a race, but to me it does. It&#039;s not the turn-by-turn tension of being neck and neck but rather the stress of sometimes being the tortoise trying to make a desperate attempt to get ahead of the hare.

The game play can be fairly heavy and thinky, while the machine building is just plain fun. The fact that you can rearrange your machine at any time, or even dump cards at any time allows for amazing flexibility.

I&#039;m not sure what the higher player counts will be like, or if I&#039;m brave enough, but honestly it seems like it wouldn&#039;t add as much time as it might chaos, and even then I suspect it would still be fun.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Kickstarted: Due August 2015</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Reminiscent of games in the past where shares are auctioned, the monies bid are put in the bank of the railway, and in turn that money is used for the expansion of said railway.

Interesting elements include:

- Shares auctioned are limited to 1 per company per round
- Winner of the share each round controls the railway
- Railways must spend as much of their capital as possible
- Order of play has a subtle nuance in it&#039;s rotation

The endgame, which many might see as chaotic, though the more I think about it the more predictable it could be, is that of set collection which in turn creates the final values for stocks.

There&#039;s really quite a bit going on in a game that plays with 6 in 90 minutes or less.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Another fine game in the the Knizia line. It&#039;s all about collecting sets of the tokens from each city to get points that way, sets of the different symbols on the tokens to get points that way, and sets of the stocks from the individual railways. Choosing what lines to isolate and which lines to merge is a  huge strategy in this game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>There&#039;s alot more to this game than meets the eye. There&#039;s the luck of the die, bit it takes a back seat on how you choose to position your players, and how well you can &quot;milk&quot; the action points that you gain from each roll. I haven&#039;t played a game yet that felt like luck every played a primary roll in the game.

I also have to say that the back and forth action of the game does a very good job of conveying that soccer feeling, even though I hadn&#039;t entered the game seeking that.</comment>				</item>

Lot&#039;s of variety in that you only choose one phase card for each per game. The new heroes also add nice variety for the defender.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Some games give you too many choices, too little time. This game does all that, and then puts a tourniquet on your resources (not to mention a penalty for needing extra money). Tough, tight game with lots of tokens. Fiddly, but solid.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is an expansion that does everything right; it adds to the play without making the game longer or more complex. Given the relative simplicity of the play I have to believe the importance of not altering the overall feel was not lost on the designer.

Indeed, if you have the base game this does nothing but add more of what you already love about it.</comment>				</item>

What we have here is a light hand management/movement/set collection game. There are some interesting tactical decisions ot be made in tile and building placement as well as that of Neptune&#039;s movement. 

It&#039;s certainly deserving of an occasional play but I have to believe that Der Schwarm obsoletes it for the most part in both weight and play time. 

Don&#039;t get me wrong SC still has a place in my collection for a different twist for what it does but I just have the feeling that if I play DS again I might feel more strongly about my obsolescent thoughts.</comment>				</item>

About half way through our first play we realized what we would an should have done differently. There&#039;s quite a few decisions, and a nice amount of tension. It plays well, and fast, even with a large number of players.

Update:

I&#039;m just not inspired to play. There are other games of equal weight and speed that keep getting chosen.</comment>				</item>

Though it will take a play or two to grasp the strategy and overall flow of the game, the payoff seems worthwhile for the 60 minutes you&#039;ll play.

It&#039;s an area majorities game at it&#039;s heart, with a smattering of intuitive worker placement. It also has a distant resemblance to Thebes as the &quot;digging for gold&quot; is a random string that pays out an average of two, but can be as high as 4. Certainly with a good plan, though, one can net great profit with minimal attempts. You can however get equally thwarted if someone else is planning a step ahead; another good sign that it&#039;s the game that rewards good planning rather than just plain luck.

I&#039;m not sure you can catch up if you&#039;re behind, though often times players are much closer in score than might first appear. The game&#039;s also only an hour, so that plays to it&#039;s favor. 

I still wonder if it&#039;s the newness of the game or not, so it earns a tentative 7 until I play once more.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The duality of the buildings as a resource/function is really tough, and is truly the central mechanism. I don&#039;t think the central stock market mechanism is as predictable or manageable as it is in Ys, but this game seems to be more about volume than value.

It&#039;s worth playing, and even owning, but I think for many it will be a straight split between love and hate.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A solid hand management and &quot;stock market&quot; game. Reminds me very much of Union Pacific if it were a card game. I know there has been alot said about the randomness in this game, but one has to give up cards to set off the random events, which means they have less to use to alter their own stick prices and even less to put out into play in front of them. 

I like the tension that lies in this game. The game has been said to be too long, but that&#039;s only with people who like to over think a simple game like this.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s worth the occasional play and certainly not with more than 4 players.

It need to be played quickly and totally non seriously for best effect.

Which-way gaming at it&#039;s best never (hopefully) to be duplicated.</comment>				</item>

The Good: Fantasy theme, character building, and feeling like you are playing &quot;against the game&quot;. 

The Bad: Random elements that strip everything you have worked for can put you out of the game completely. Way too long for what I derive from it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This one will definitly take more plays to ferret out the strategy. I&#039;m actually worried that there isn&#039;t very much here. It&#039;s a light, fast-paced game, and has some nice elements in that you can create situations for yourself to get out multiple pieces. The luck of the draw seems mitigated by the fact that there is such a wide variety of terrain, and the fact that you can build upwards (which also allows you to play multiple pieces more predictably).The one thing that got me with this one is that there doesn&#039;t seem to be much of a way to affect other players&#039; progress, and the game can end quite abruptly. At the end of our first game I felt like That&#039;s It?!?&quot;.</comment>	<conditiontext>Update: Increased to a 7. I&#039;m still unsure how many viable strategies there are in the game, but recent plays with more experienced players showed me that there is a true game here, and that there is a fair amount of tension when playing it. The game can be competitive, and brutal. More plays will make this rise a notch more, or make it fall off forever.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A very nice mix of 6 Nimmt! and Hornochsen that melds into a game with far less luck and a ton more fun. There is alot more strategy here than meets the eye. While the game can get much more random when you have more than 5 or 6 players, it&#039;s still tons of fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Played twice at Prezcon &#039;06, and taught to me by the indominable Morgan Dontanville. Tight gameplay that builds increasing tension over each round of the game. Well balanced action cards insure none are completely useless. It&#039;s a bit abstract, but I like that in a game. This will be a surefire win for Cafe Games....if they can ever get it off the presses. Slated for May &#039;06 when I played it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>While my initial rating for this was an 8 it has now risen to a 9 after 3 plays. I&#039;ve tried 3 races and seen most of the others played and I keep seeing not just variety in the races but variety in the flow and play of the game between sessions. I enjoy this game with any number simply because the lack of power from a lack of neighbors adds another challenge to the game as much as  a crowded board does. 5p is a bit long for my tastes but I am still willing to play that way for an occasional session.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Some random elements yet with avenues to victory that rely on planning more than luck.

It&#039;s fast even with 5, and has some really adrenaline fueled moments.

It remains to be seen if it will hold up under continued plays.

Update: Repeated plays have shown that this game just starts getting good when it comes to an end. Certain avenues of victory seem only favorable to those who can start them first.

I&#039;m really disappointed and of to the trade pile it goes.</comment>				</item>

After 4 plays I can say that the game plays at a good speed, with a moderate play time. I will say that while playing with 6 is fun, I have to believe that this one is best with 4.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s a unique combo that offers many layers of strategy, and serves up alot of tension. The only down side being that the randomness of the digging can be hit or miss; though this aspect is exactly why many love it, and often why I loathe it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Finally played the FULL game, which is the way everyone should experience this game the first time. We called it with 1/3 of the 3rd deck left, as it was clear who would win.

I&#039;ve played Civ and Advanced Civ before, and this definitely fits the bill as a card version of those, but I feel that unless you play it enough to know the game, the play time doesn&#039;t actually come in at any less than those games. It&#039;s supposed to be shorter, and with experience I&#039;m certain it is. 

The question is, will I want to play this again, or even frequently?

Update:

Another play, and soon to see even more. It&#039;s been a long time coming getting it to the table, but since we&#039;ve now got a following for it in our club I have no doubt that the plays for this one will rise.</comment>				</item>

You also try to corner off some landscape for some extra points. This is a very nice abstract, and can easily win over those who dislike abstracts.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Certainly not hiding it&#039;s Dominion influenced play, nor it&#039;s D&amp;D roots, Thunderstone is VERY good. It&#039;s also very easy on the eyes.

Anyone not wanting to play a more richly themed more objective based Dominion with a 60 minute play time stay away.

Gameplay is about recognizing what monsters there are, what tools you have available and what combination will work best to defeat them. It&#039;s familiar but not. 

I&#039;m truly looking forward to more plays and any expansions this will have. 

Update:

Additional expansions slow this game down to a crawl making it a shadow of what the base game promised.

This one will need to have more plays before we decide it&#039;s worth.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This one is gonna take a lot more plays to truly start to grasp the depth of the strategy to be found. This is a very fine trick taking game. If you haven&#039;t had the opportunity you definitely should give it a try.

Update: A very good trick taker. One of my favorites.

After tons of plays later, this is not only the best trick taking game there is, but it makes you long to play it while you play others like it. It still needs 4 players, so there are other games I reach for with 3 or 5, but there are no other 3- player experiences that compare.

Update:

Played again. Realized I hadn&#039;t rated it a ten, yet it is. ;)</comment>				</item>

The gameplay, and the sometimes eteral wait for the one card you need have started to wear thin. I have played so many games since these, that the lack of control has begun to irk me.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>I love the passengers....I love the streamlined board.....I even love the new ticket system and the elimination of the longest route for most tickets completed; but for some reason I feel like the +4 Locos spoil the game, at least with 3 players.

What beautiful production values.

Update:

Much better with more than 3 players. Will have to try 3 again and see if strategy was the flaw.

Update:

No flaws here. It&#039;s just a deeper version of ticket that take more learning to understand the nuances of the map.</comment>	<conditiontext>Update:

This one takes itself way too seriously, and tries to add strategic elements that just don&#039;t work as well when you already have a game with limited control. 

Good as the original, but not great.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I just can&#039;t like this game as much as I always hoped I would.

Invested in a copy recently as I wanted the entire mask trilogy. I&#039;m hoping my tastes have evolved into seeing how good this game realy is.

Update:

Years later I play again and finally see some good in Tikal. It&#039;s still my least favorite of the series, and the annoyance that is &quot;player to your left flips a tile with tokens, everyone takes them before you can get any&quot; puts a cramp in my enjoyment.

I also think the game is VERY dependent upon the skill of the players and how well they place the tiles.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Yet another mistake in naming/branding a game with a previous one by the same designer.

FF made this mistake, and while I think the game he made was fine, it&#039;s just not related very closely to it&#039;s predecessor. 

K &amp; K have done the same here and made a game that&#039;s only marginally related.

No action points. No worker placement. No area majority.

The similarity lies in the traversing of boundaries. In Tikal it was an action point cost.  You could make the cost more prohibitive in the orientation of the hexes when you place them. In T2 it&#039;s about set collection to allow yourself to cross the boundaries. You can still orient tiles to make them more prohibitive but only slightly so.

So what we end up with is a much more tactical game that falls into the light-medium area of gaming. There is still the min-maxing but in much simpler form. On the up side the AP is really kept to a minimum and the game plays much faster overall.

I think that group-think has grabbed most of the early adopters and players who, like with Factory Manager before it, were lead to the wrong assumption about T2&#039;s game play. There&#039;s a quality game here that I&#039;m willing to play again; indeed much more than games like Stone Age, Kingsburg, or even Fresco. 

This is obviously meant to bring a mere slice of the flavor that was Tikal while delivering something else altogether  different. There&#039;s really not much out there like it either IMHO. 

One thing is for sure, and sadly has been for a while: one of my favorite designers, Wolfgang Kramer, is just not designing game for the more hardcore crowd any more. Like Knizia before him, the stuff that made him legend is not only his legacy, but the games we should turn to rather than anything newer released by him.</comment>				</item>

I never realized the playing pieces had special abilities which drastically effects gameplay (before I read the rules that is). Luck if the draw can swing things the wrong direction sometimes, but strategy and good choices still ruled the day.</comment>				</item>

If you invest wider, control your spending, and take care with your turn order there&#039;s little that luck has to do with here.

I really like:

- When you mine future mining costs rise
- Adits and trains give motivation for consolidated building and the chance for synergy.
- The bonuses of the developments still apply when an area is &quot;explored&quot;

Play is brisk thanks to the time track, which is a mini-Neuland mechanism :)

Another play:

The random market is evil and the tougher/more favorable the market, the more ferocious the bidding is. The wilder the swings the more fun this game can be. 

I do have concerns that there is a high potential for draws given the way external investments are proportioned.</comment>				</item>

- When you finally unlock certain racial abilities they feel like too little too late

- Some of the races aren&#039;t very good

- This game feels like more of a race than 4x. 

I do like it, and will play it at least a few more times, but I&#039;m losing interest rapidly.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Kickstarted - Due September 2014</wishlistcomment></item>

Your real goal is to steer the last cube/cubes toward your area to you can score the color and get first choice on treasures.

There are some real decisions to be made here, though the luck element still leaves a good deal of guess work. This should be played at a brisk pace for best results.

It currently sits on the bubble to see how it fares after repeated plays.</comment>				</item>

While it&#039;s not the pick up and deliver game that I had hoped it might be, it&#039;s an equally good route builder. I like the ability to offensively use stations to sap opponents liquid cash. There&#039;s a real challenge to stay as lean and mean with your deck building too.

This will see regular play for some time to come.</comment>				</item>

The Good: It has a good idea as a basic premise and the game makes sense....

The Bad: ...until you realize the random destinations can totally utterly hose you and give the game to an opponent or worse than you are forced to help another player, who already has the upper hand, gain an even larger advantage.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s most certainly an overlooked gem from Essen &#039;07.

While it&#039;s just worker placement, hand management, and majorities, the way each area implements the collection of these objects gives such wide variety, not to mention the multiple ways to collect points. There seems no way to be shut out.

There&#039;s just something about the swift flow of the game, faction benefits, and not to mention the short playtime that really make this one come together.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>For a game with piles of dice, random events, and random action spaces there is sure a ton of control in this game.

The key is that no player is ever locked out of being able to use a given action space. There&#039;s even the ability to &quot;flip&quot; dice to their opposite face, reroll dice, or action spaces to convert the color of dice.

In all quite a fine game that I hope to own some day.</comment>				</item>

I do feel like this game could be rated higher, but in comparison to all the other great trick taking games that I have, this one still falls into the &quot;neat&quot; category. It&#039;ll see occasional plays, but not as often as others.

Update: Repeat plays downgrade this one to a &quot;meh&quot;.</comment>				</item>

Totally random score wise, though with &quot;skilled&quot; tosses you can score consistently, or cause others not to, and likely do consistently well.

So fast that you can play it several times in a row.</comment>				</item>

Update: This rose to a 9, then back to an 8 as El Capitain trumps it in every way.</comment>	<conditiontext>Update: More plays brings this up 2 points to a 9. Now I need to play El Capitain.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>US is a game of focusing on building in the most valuable areas in order to reap the greatest money and points. You have to be careful to focus not only on single blocks but in entire rows for majorities. The major complication is that of the zoning rules. Building in such a manner as to facilitate not only early game but also late game plays is important otherwise you will not be able to adapt. All of this is also a key in gaining control of the different roles in the game. 

At first blush the game seem VERY random yet there is a subtle balance in the events over the entirety of the game. I have already seen, and predict in the future of this game, that most will play once and be completely turned off. It&#039;s a shame that Mr. Jensen&#039;s games require multiple plays, more so than almost any other designs that I have tried, in order to begin understanding the play, the &quot;story arc&quot; of the game, and indeed how to play competitively. 

With two plays under our belt, our last game being VERY close and back and forth on all players parts, we look forward to more and I foresee the rating rising.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Tentative rating after one play with 5. 

It&#039;s pickup and deliver with random chances at the orders you fulfill and the equipment available to you.

I will say this; the more players the more chaos. I saw another play with 3 that was much closer and much more strategic.

It&#039;s what I was expecting from this game, and had feared with 5 players. I&#039;m thinking this one caps out with 4.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a worker placement game, know that up front.

The real twist is managing the timing of your actions combined with smart use of the character powers and perhaps a little luck.

Really a solid mix of gather, manage, and place. The real key is the timing of the actions as well as clever placement of your ships in the exploration section.

Solid game.</comment>				</item>

Update: Downgraded to a 6. It&#039;s just &quot;meh&quot;. It shares the aspects of so many &quot;better&quot; games I love. This is just a family version of those, and serves it purpose, but definitely not my first choice.</comment>				</item>

There&#039;s a smattering of luck and a smattering of planning. 

Overall I like it, but it will take more plays to see if it&#039;s as good as it seems at first.

I also haven&#039;t tried the advanced/variant version, which will either add a layer of depth, or a layer of unwelcome chaos.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>While I cannot think of any specific examples at the time I write this, Village is one of a newer breed of games that offers a fair variety of scoring possibilities, with a fair number of routes to obtain each, the trick is that all of them are equal opportunity. What&#039;s more is that because all things are fairly equal and it&#039;s by the narrow margin of points here or there that you will win.

You have to keep track of the big picture, not only that but the fact that you have to time the use of your workers as they age out in order, this latter bit being the most interesting and tension inducing. I quite enjoyed what this package had to offer. It does fill a niche in my collection, which means that it will see more play and stick around for some time to come.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This game is CONVOLUTED. It&#039;s as though they created the game and then tried to find ways to make things more difficult, primarily by adding more steps to very simple goals. That means there are more rules governing play and more times you&#039;ll be referencing the rules to ensure you&#039;re playing right. 

I&#039;m not sure I want to play this again. I already own Pret A Porter which does something similar without all the chaff. It also plays faster (not incredibly so), so I think Vinhos is on it&#039;s way out.</comment>				</item>

While I found the character powers interesting the rest of the game isn&#039;t all that great. The randomness of events really hurts some players while helping others; it especially helps those who get followers early.

I did think the Tron Light-Cycle-like streams of zombies you leave behind you was an interesting, and lightly strategic, concept however there&#039;s no benefit or real penalty to killing zombies.

One last warning: the goal of the game is to scout 3 locations and while gettting your first two seems to come relatively swiftly the last one drags the game out, and that&#039;s not even due to the influence of players on one another!</comment>				</item>

Overall it&#039;s very light, fast, easy to get into, and quite competitive. Even when the tiles are &quot;not in your favor&quot; you can utilize the abundance of a resource you don&#039;t need in other ways. Turn order is also surprisingly important adding some significant tension to an otherwise solitaire game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I can&#039;t quite understand why the different nations pieces weren&#039;t color-coded to match their borders (like many other games - Axis and Allies did this 20 YEARS AGO!) I also find it hard to distinguish some features and locations when the board gets crowded. On the plus side, this game is a LOTR fan&#039;s dream (if you dig deep strategy, or sometimes even if you don&#039;t) and even though there is a random nature given to it by the dice, the abilities the characters and minions add and the cards give make the game level out in terms of luck. What would a war game be without some luck in it? It is obviously not made for casual gamers, Grognards (for the most part), or perhaps even Spielfreaks; However, for those who seek a moderate war game with a fantastic theme and have the patience to play a 2-3 hour game, none will be disappointed. I like this game alot and look forward to many future plays.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>WOW! This is the first LCG/CCG in quite some time that was so simple yet still has layers of interaction. It&#039;s simply the best one I&#039;ve played since CoC, and interestingly enough from the same designer.

More big praises:

- Beautiful Artwork, and I mean STUNNING
- Quality multi-player
- Cards are used as resources and still function normally rather than sacrifice or choose what they are used for; something new in this genre.

I can only see this one getting better. 

Update:

Many Battle Packs, 2 large box expansions and plenty of deck building later and I still love this game as much as ever. Great fun, great design, and especially in the last large expansion, great new ideas and strategies to try out.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Dripping with theme, incredible amounts of chrome, and interesting game play leave this one at 7. It&#039;s still too random to be better, but certainly worth occasional table time.

Update:

This game is about pattern recognition and tile placement. I think playing with a full compliment is chaos, but the game is so fast and flavorful it doesn&#039;t really matter.</comment>				</item>

Some old school majorities and synergy. You can see this is an obvious early &quot;Martin Wallace does something not involving trains&quot;. It has potential, and I think if he ever revised it and smoothed out the rough edges (bad comparison but think Brass to Age of Industry) that it would be possible to make a game I&#039;d want to play here.

The Combat:

This game requires and encourages combat. Combat is simply roll offs of D6&#039;s. The results of this are equal parts encouraging and distressing.

I wouldn&#039;t seek it out. Perhaps it needs another play but with so much good Wallace out there I&#039;m not sure that I would want to.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s one of the original so-called &quot;super-fillers&quot;. It&#039;s filled with tension and just the right amount of tactics. It&#039;s fairly random, but plays so quickly I cannot care. </comment>				</item>

You have to work in your pieces to gain majorities for the best points, but the action cards are the nasty part of the game. The longer you can keep them the better you can do. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This seems like an attempt to improve on Pirate&#039;s Cove. For the most part I would say it&#039;s successful, yet still not all that great a game. Perhaps it&#039;s because I played this game now, in 2012, not back in 2007 when it was released. It&#039;s not a design that has aged very well.

I find the blind bidding, especially late game, becomes predictable and almost a joke. The best move in the game is to move then gust of wind, allowing you to usually move and score twice in a round. This coupled with scoring influence in the zones of play and trasure maps makes WoP shallow and generally un-fun. The only redeeming quality is it is easy to learn and it is short.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I enjoy &quot;betting on the ponies&quot;. While the die rolling to move the horses makes the game 70% luck, threre is the idea of screwing with your oponents by making a worse movement decision for a horse they are betting on.

The game suggests 3 rounds, but if people get behind, there sems to be no way for them to catch up in some cases.</comment>				</item>

I LOVE the new cards. There are some scoring cards that really benefit from the longer game that this expansion creates and to that end there are an ennumerable number of ways to get points.

The new Winter board is a nice touch. The new leaders are a welcome change and having coop and conquest instants stripped out of the deck means almost always drafting more meaningful cards while still having a chance to splash them in.

The supply die is interesting and actually speeds up the game start a bit.

The game is longer, that&#039;s to be sure, but if you liked the system I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll mind.</comment>				</item>

It was fast and my group likes it so while I&#039;m not likely to ask for it I&#039;m also unlikely to refuse to play. There are decisions to be made but if you&#039;re doing well there comes a point where you almost know you have won.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Based on one play with five. There&#039;s a lot of chaos here, but quite a bit of strategy. It&#039;s probably in the same realm of the second half of For Sale when it comes to the level of luck and screwage there can be, however there&#039;s a glimmer of depth here that more plays might reveal.

Update:

After dozens of plays I think this one is best with 4, however the overall experience is as I had originally observed; it is one part chaos, one part strategy. It certainly helps knowing the other players so as you can divine some knowledge of their possible next moves.

Solid 7. Oh, and I will also say the game is a bit long with 5 as this one is a &quot;the faster the better&quot; kind of game.</comment>				</item>

We&#039;ve played by the new rules but in time we&#039;ll be interested in changing things back to old school, or a combination of both.</comment>				</item>

- The theme works. When you&#039;re screaming for different ingredients or shouting out the current order it DEFINITELY feels like a short order kitchen.

- Unlike most fully coop games it&#039;s vital for each player to fully control the generation of the ingredients in front of them as well as spend ingredients for and collect completed orders efficiently. It&#039;s all hands on deck.

This game takes such serious focus to play well I was mentally fatigued as much as most heavy games I play, and I guess that&#039;s a certain weight of the game in and of itself.

There are multiple approaches at the start of the game, important and varied decisions on buying mid game, and it all culminates in what you hope will be success in the final round, but initial plays have shown that the best laid plans are not always fruitful. 

What a great game. It&#039;s a shame that it&#039;s among so many games shelved by the Filosofia buy out.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>In many ways a reverse version of Pillars of the Earth; instead of worker placement to activate abilities and cards you use a hand of cards to gain tokens, resources, and points.

This game has a tight design and some clever elements. The upkeep at th end of each era is a source of major tension. I also like the sheer variety of ways to achieve vp&#039;s. 

Finally, though it&#039;s a totally randomizing element, the events keep things constantly changing, evolving, and keep you off step.

I&#039;m not sure I could ever play Pillars again.</comment>				</item>

Can&#039;t wait to have the expansion so this will see more play.

UPDATE:

After a play with the expansion (with 5 players): This is one of the best games I own, even better with the expansion. I&#039;m sorry I never made the 5th set of pieces myself. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>More plays might make this one sink, but I don&#039;t think so. It&#039;s aazing how the mechanics in this game almost eliminate the luck of the dice, and their effect on the gameplay. 

Update:

A good mix fo luck and strategy just might make this game Spiel Des Jahres.</comment>	<conditiontext>Update:

Play number 4 solidifies this as one of the best I own. Everyone who has played has liked or loved it, and wanted to play again. I think this will definitely be game of the year.</conditiontext>			</item>

Roll 3 blindly drawn dice. Keep brains and shotgun blasts. Stop and score your brains, keep going and refill your hand to 3 dice (blind draw). You reuse footprints as part of your 3, so the number you refresh to is variable. Get 3 shotgun blasts and lose that rounds&#039; progress. 

The best thing is that of the 13 dice 6 are green (2 footprint, 3 brain, one shotty), 4 are yellow (2 footprint, 2 brain, 2 shotty) and 3 are red (2 footprint, 1 brain, 3 shotty), so now you see the statistical chances for your rolls as well as your blind draws. It&#039;s really a neat system.

Neat-O theme as well.</comment>				</item>

The Good: Zombies and killing zombies.

The Bad: Without the variant movement takes far too long, especially given better choices that are on the market in the past few years.

Update:

In spirit it will always be a 10.</comment>				</item>

I think some might feel fiddling with the original formula is a travesty, but i&#039;m glad this idea was revisited properly. It could almost be it&#039;s own new game.</comment>				</item>
