	<numplays>29</numplays>			<comment>Unexpected discovery at Essen 2008.  Truly beautiful production of a small press game, with bilingual rules and cards (Spanish/English).  A simple elegant wargame with simultaneous movement orders (that are not cumbersome due to low number of them being done!) and a bit of randomness from drawing a special card each turn, playable in 20 minutes!  Very cool.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Unusual theme in an economic / war hybrid. Longer and more fiddly than I prefer, and some unfortunate art/color choices, but if you like medium/heavy economic games with conflict and ability to manipulate neutral forces (players are mining companies whose lobbyists are used to make countries do stuff), well worth checking out!

I revised the English translation and helped hash out some rules questions with Andrzej.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>The auction mechanisms are great and fresh, but some of the tile placement and garbage movement and extra road placement etc are just too annoyingly fiddly for me. (And in practice it seems people easily make mistakes and unintentionally cheat about some of this fiddly stuff.) So I have mixed feelings about this game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>A curious short abstract strategy game.  The first phase (placement) feels arbitrary at first, and the second phase (movement) is more important, but upon further play it seems that the second phase has fairly few significant decisions, and that the first phase is where the important decisions are really made.  Because all the pieces must be moved, yet many of the movements are forced (and often won&#039;t even change the game result), the second phase sometimes feels like an anticlimactic ceremony to me.  But it is so short that perhaps that&#039;s not a real problem.  A little analogous to the last phase of Fjords in that sense.

It&#039;s so short that it works fine as an abstract filler.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Suffers from the problem that rational play seems to dictate cautious defensiveness, so the game can draw out forever.  I have read that there are various proposals to mend this, but the game according to its rules that I&#039;ve played is not very exciting for me, even ignoring that issue.  I wanted to like it more than I did.  It&#039;s playable, but there are so many more enjoyable abstract strategy games.</comment>				</item>

It took longer than I&#039;d like, but I imagine it would speed up with experience.  Lots of different subsystems and possible strategies.

	<numplays>42</numplays>			<comment>Interesting system. I&#039;m still getting used to it, and keep playing with the different rules of the different boards that Maks (who owns it) keeps bringing, so I&#039;ve still never played the &quot;standard&quot; version.

2009-07-03: I&#039;ve now played the standard map a few times, and continuing to enjoy AoS. I got obsessed enough to make the wiki page [[Age of Steam FAQ]] and to download some more maps to try out. The game does not feel elegant to me, and it&#039;s not ideal as a 2-player game, and it&#039;s a tough one to teach to newbies (because of its brutal &quot;the game hates you&quot; nature, and because it&#039;s a bit long for more casual gamers) - nonetheless it&#039;s an excellent game that I&#039;m glad I am finally into, and I expect to keep playing. I&#039;m also happy that my SO also enjoys it, despite it being longer than her normal preference.

2010: I&#039;ve played on a variety of maps now and still like it. I wish the production weren&#039;t random though; that&#039;s my main gripe with the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Only played Scandinavia once, an unusual map with very few connection possibilities. Enjoyed the game.

Years later played Korea (2014-03-08 at Maks and Asia&#039;s, I won) and enjoyed it. The changing demands at cities depending on their current cubes there is a significant change! The stupid/bad map graphics show 3 different types of mountains, but according to some rules thread, they are all &quot;hills&quot; and cost $3.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>St. Lucia is a cool 2-player game! Random setup and then purely deterministic from then on, very tense and interesting. In my first session of it, we played 3 times in a row. (One game ended in a bankruptcy in round 1... :)

The solitaire Barbados is nice but seems to be more for learning the system than for a serious challenge. At least I won it 3 times (final money after rebuying my shares = 19, 49, and 38) after having played other AoS games 6 times. More games = 13, 69, 45, 60.

2009-07-03: having played more maps, including the standard map finally, I&#039;m a little less enchanted with St. Lucia due to its deviations from the standard rules. And as others have said, AoS ultimately seems more interesting multi-player. But still worth checking out.</comment>				</item>

The 5 actions are all fairly balanced, but one is slightly better (clearly by design) which gives a good incentive to choose it if you can, and a tactical reason to try to force the opponent to not be able to choose it by making a threat to win which requires them to use some other action.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>58</numplays>			<comment>Very cool placement game! Starts off with mysterious open chaos and gradually becomes very tight and calculational and tactical. Well worth trying!

The maze-building mechanism and strategy reminds me a little of Quoridor or Fresh Fish etc, in that you can never make a move that cuts off access.

The opening phase can feel somewhat arbitrary, but at some point things start to snap into place and the game can then become VERY unforgiving of errors! Choosing the right moment to claim a tower is crucial, and a tower could be worth wildly varying amounts depending on what happens.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Won at [[Pionek]] 2009-06-14 for 2nd place in logical games tournament.

It seems the possibility of 2 players competing for the same secret goal color (and thus stealing it back and forth from each other) is a flaw in the rules. 
The art is hard to distinguish, especially the tiny dark murky base camp colors, and the yellow/white towers/cubes.
The expedition bridges tend to fall off each other if you get them stacked oddly.
You must be careful not to bump the table as pieces can accidentally slide, and the towers can fall over revealing their secret color.
I&#039;m not attracted to continuous space type games (one reason I never got into miniatures) where you can occasionally disagree about whether something reaches/touches something else.
Also beware there is a little bit of memory element as well.
But taken casually, the game can be fun, despite the flaws.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>Enjoyable tactical system. I like it enough that I created [[Ancient Battles Deluxe FAQ]].

It has more scenarios than I&#039;ll probably ever finish playing (especially with the expansions), but I am soloing my way through them (hoping that eventually I&#039;ll get some friend interested in playing them too).

Main downside: the hexes are a bit small, so it can get a little physically fiddly in dense map areas.

Also the counters are old style VPG quality, i.e. they shed weird white paper fuzz from their edges. But after trimming them with my Oregon Laminations counter clipper, I like them. And I still prefer old style VPG counters to the burned black soot of VPG&#039;s new laser cut counters, even if VPG&#039;s new game counters are thicker. :)

The unusual combat resolution seems to confuse people at first, but it&#039;s actually simple once you grok it, and it&#039;s clearly described.

ABD is much simpler and quicker to play than GBOH (typically an hour or 2 at most for a scenario), but of course is also less detailed/chromey than GBOH. If a more generic feel bugs you, then ABD might not be for you.

And it&#039;s more traditional / wargame-ish than C&amp;C Ancients. So it seems to hit a nice &quot;sweet spot&quot; for me and other ABD fans.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Simple ancients wargame? Not sure. Alfred likes it. :)</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Current mediocre rating (5) based on problems of balance. The core system is promising and clever and cool (a pure abstract strategy randomless spaceship combat game in 4 pages!), but as it stands, it doesn&#039;t work well as a finished game yet. But it has potential to be a good system.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Feels like a work in progress to us:

There seems no clear incentive to actually place the 4th pyramid on a card since it gives the opponent control over what colors will be on the next higher level, and also gives them a chance to gain a bonus card.

So we found lots of started partial structures everywhere instead of the very tall towers shown in the rules. (Maybe we were playing too &quot;seriously&quot; instead of just for the fun of making tall structures? But the game has enough rules and lasts sufficiently long that it seems intended to go beyond mere light filler.)

And the random chaos actions make any attempt to plan ahead feel sort of pointless, as you have no realistic idea what your goal color will be in the end, so no idea what colors to hurt or help.

We tried without the random chaos actions which made it seem more strategic but again the problem of no clear reason to place the 4th pyramid and give the opponent control over the next level seemed too significant.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I played the original edition back in the 90s.  Then 2008-01-05 I played a 5-player game of this new edition, with some expansions, and it took us almost 6 hours of collecting spell/weapon/skill cards and having wildly random encounters and cooperating to kill monsters and close enough gates.

The long play time was partly caused by 2 players selling their gate trophies instead of keeping them, but still, the game went way too long, and it got repetitive and frustrating.

The old me would have enjoyed that long slog more than the new me.  It&#039;s a good game if you&#039;re into this sort of boardgame roleplaying adventure.  It has some neat mechanics, and it&#039;s fun seeing the large amount of special cards.  But I don&#039;t seem to be into this kind of game very much any more.  My time is too short.

The components are quite well-done with some beautiful art, and some of the flavor text is nice.  (Some of it is silly, e.g. the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; cherry pie reference in a diner encounter.)

Beware it is VERY text-dependent, if you play with non-native-English speakers.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>As written, it seems to have the all-too-common &quot;fuzzy wuzzy fallacy&quot; of lots of small fast ships being able to destroy a few big slow ships.

We want to try again with a couple rule tweaks to try to tone down the small/medium power vs larges:
1. Small ships move 3 steps (as you&#039;d expect, instead of 4).
2. Range for ships is their ship size, instead of all ships firing long like big ships do.

Or play with equal forces on both sides.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>38</numplays>			<comment>Clever, and nice pieces.  Army of Frogs is to Hive as Tantrix is to Trax, maybe.  Simple rules make it nice for newbies and nongamers and kids too.  Need to play more to see how much lasting power it will have over me.

Possible problem with endgame dragging in a deadlock of sorts sometimes, which gets broken only if someone makes a silly brainfart mistake and lets someone win.

Also the opening part with random drawing and placing is usually inconclusive and feels a bit ritualistic to get to the second part when all frogs are out and it becomes pure strategy with no chance.

	<numplays>32</numplays>			<comment>2012-01-16: Thanks, Secret Santa! :)

Fun solitaire sf wargame. It has a nice retro sf feel like Steve Jackson&#039;s Ogre (an obvious inspiration), but with Saberhagen-style berserkers in space instead of Laumer-style bolos on land.

The rules are fairly short and simple but unfortunately have some unclear places and errors; be sure to download the FAQ ( http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/63672/faq-for-astra-titanusunofficial )

As a solitaire game it starts to feel repetitive in terms of strategy and tactics, but I still took about 30 plays before completing all 8 scenarios successfully, so I certainly got a lot of play out of it! I expect I&#039;ll still bring it out occasionally.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Like Agricola and La Havre, it&#039;s a fiddly production engine type game, but shorter and easier to grok than La Havre and more interesting/appealing (IMHO) than Agricola. It&#039;s got a kind of addictive &quot;I can do it more efficiently next time&quot; appeal: we played it 3 times in one day (2-player) after borrowing it from friends. Cute wooden veggies. But perhaps too much luck of the draw...?

2010-12-26: I&#039;ve realized I&#039;m not so into these kinds of fiddly games with tons of different cards with unique effects all in play at the same time. Complexity from a complex system with lots of stuff is less interesting to me than complexity from a simple elegant system that has deep consequences.</comment>				</item>

The luck of the tile draws is a little annoying, but at least there&#039;s the one-time mulligan to get rid of a terrible draw. I want to play more.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>17</numplays>			<comment>Quite cool fun game which has a bit of a Quoridor vibe (but your blocking walls can [i]shift[/i] to some extent, with interesting restrictions on how).

The interestingly restricted movement rule (you can&#039;t split groups and you must make the moving unit be a space closer to one of its closest neighbors) works out interestingly well.

And somewhat unexpected &quot;win if you can&#039;t move&quot; rule (instead of simply &quot;win if you unite all your stones into one group&quot;) means that you must be careful not to isolate your opponent&#039;s remaining groups into separate disconnected regions, even though temporarily isolating them can be useful. That&#039;s cool.</comment>				</item>

The game play felt opaque until the endgame. Like certain other games (e.g. Synapse-Ice), it seems like opening moves have no clear meaning/effect, and only near the end you become able to read ahead, and can clearly see &quot;Aha, Player X will win!&quot; I enjoyed it as a quick filler.</comment>				</item>

A childhood favorite in my family, and now I&#039;m enjoying it again, since the evening I first met Anna at an Esperanto event in Helsinki in 2005 and she proposed playing Backgammon during a late night conversation.

2015-02-16: I realized that we enjoy playing this quite often, already 220 logged plays. So I increased my rating from 7 to 8.</comment>	<conditiontext>Why do manufacturers of magnetic sets never seem to take care to align all the pieces&#039; magnets in the same direction?</conditiontext>			</item>

The gimmick of not knowing other peoples&#039; roles didn&#039;t seem sufficiently interesting to me, and seems to cause people to shoot at others randomly, whether that will be good or bad for them.  For shooting other people, I&#039;d rather play the elegant fun game Cash and Guns.

	<numplays>16</numplays>			<comment>Quite well done solitaire wargame! Medium complexity with surprisingly few rules holes for such a game. The game really creates a dramatic feel, with the Germans starting out strong and making progress, then gradually bogging down as the USSR forces build up and push them back. I have won handily, lost ignominously, and finished in between. Good replay value for a long (several hours) solitaire game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>Quite clever game which feels a little like Hey That&#039;s My Fish, Amazons, Fjords, and the like, where you&#039;re essentially trying to cut off more territory than the opponent... but it&#039;s got a really interesting twist that you also have to commit a certain number of disks to different spaces, with each move, so you could end up with a big space all your own but not enough disks to fill it up, thus costing yourself.

The rules are dead-simple, and the strategy is cool and non-obvious. It plays quickly. Well worth trying out.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Very cool game; playable with scavenged bits, and we ultimately didn&#039;t buy it at Essen. But I think its box is compact and its disks were pleasing and stack well...</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Not my type of game: (1) I&#039;m not so into cooperative/team games. (2) There&#039;s no real planning, just reacting to a long series of random events that lasted way too long in the slow group I played with. (3) Lots of discussion about who might be a Cylon, acting/roleplay to look innocent and cast suspicion on others, voting/debating about other issues, etc which is hard for me in Polish... 

But I was glad to try it to see what it&#039;s like, as it&#039;s quite popular and clearly has some clever ideas. The card play system is a good elegant variation of the failure cards from Kill Dr. Lucky, and it works well. The basic mechanics are simple and ultimately not so interesting - the point of the game is the suspicion and negotiation and paranoia and discussion. I would probably enjoy it a lot more if (1) I played in English or Esperanto instead of Polish and (2) all players were faster and more focused. My first game lasted roughly 5 hours, and that&#039;s just too long for this.

To enjoy the core experience (secret traitors thwarting the shared goal), I recommend the much shorter card game [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9220/saboteur]Saboteur[/url] - it&#039;s small, easy to teach, and lasts a half hour instead many hours.</comment>				</item>

(Plus it requires a VERY stable table, and suffers from the problem all such games have, of what if your tower falls down but it&#039;s not really your fault?)

Auction mechanism for bidding on useful pieces or paying to avoid difficult useless pieces: that makes it a Eurogame wannabe.

So it&#039;s a strange hybrid that was amusing once just to see what it was like, but I feel no compulsion to play it again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m probably not in the target audience. I am not a fan of partner-based trick-taking games, nor of weird traditional games which gratuitously reorder the value of the printed card values for no clear reason other than to confuse me... Also odd that the cards weren&#039;t fully shuffled between rounds but just stacked and redealt; no idea if that is normal or just one of the diverse variants.</comment>				</item>

But the beautifully lush rich art is sort of overwhelming; we liked the simple elegant clear art of the original Auf Heller und Pfennig the best.  The plastic figures are hard to read/distinguish until you get used to them; the little scoring diamonds are hard to see.  I shouldn&#039;t have to think about painting them to make them clearer... It&#039;s a triumph of beauty over usefulness, which detracts from enjoyment of playing the game.

The Beowulf theme is a bit nonsensical since your unique powerful Beowulf piece goes away after using it once (even though thematically Beowulf should participate in all 3 parts) while the weakest pieces remain forever, so that&#039;s odd, but whatever.</comment>	<conditiontext>Won Polish edition &quot;Beowulf: Gra Planszowa&quot; at Pionek, June 2008, thanks to winning Neuroshima Hex tournament.</conditiontext>			</item>

I like the 2 phases: first cards are given out, then the cards not already given to players are auctioned in the second half of the game. The gameplay experience can be quite different depending on whether you get a lot of gold or a lot of non-gold in the first half (as we found in our first 2 games).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>We were kind of disappointed when we tried it out at Essen 2011:
1. The basic scoring mechanism seems OK but didn&#039;t thrill us.
2. The memory aspect was a turnoff for us.
3. The &quot;beer coaster&quot; type pieces seem like they&#039;d be at risk of getting distinguishable marks, which breaks the intended memory aspect.

For this kind of &quot;memory game with flipping tiles&quot; I guess we&#039;ll stick with Logan Stones, which we already own and which has much sturdier bakelite tiles instead of beer coasters.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played once, 6 players, to my surprise I came in 2nd (124 points, only 4 points behind winner with 128).

A fine change of pace, but not my preferred type of game:

Too long for the heavy randomness.

Cute components help create atmosphere, that&#039;s good, but it&#039;s really stupid that all 3 types of black plastic truck look identical except for different barely visible numerals on their cab roofs. And a hassle that they all only hold 4 cubes comfortably. Stacking 9 in the &quot;large&quot; truck is a balancing pain in the ass. And it&#039;s awkward having to put one of your dudes on the truck (where it falls off) or next to the truck to remember whose is whose.

Heavy negotiation, not my preferred style. (Alas, especially since moving to Poland where I don&#039;t understand the language well.)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>96</numplays>			<comment>Kind of a clever Blokus/Go hybrid as you try to place all your pieces touching your own pieces and have to pay if you touch someone else&#039;s. Very nice elegant system, and scales from 2 to 6 players. 2-player seems very unforgiving of mistakes - sometimes only one payment takes place. Multiplayer is more chaotic of course but interesting since then you sometimes have decisions about who to pay. Also nice that the initial setup of the blocks and roots can really influence the way the game unfolds. I also like playing it at http://superdupergames.org.

[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/525271/a-good-combinatorial-pyramid-placement-game]My review.[/url]

There seems to be a potential 2-player problem with first-player advantage, but I won&#039;t swear to it yet; quite possibly we&#039;ll discover more, who knows. Even if true, I still enjoy playing it a lot!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>62</numplays>			<comment>So far, I&#039;ve only played online vs AI at Marquand.net. The choice of when/where to play the 3rd pillar can be interesting. Callisto&#039;s a nice little placement game, and comparisons to Blokus seem inevitable.

I find Blokus to be more aesthetically pleasing (e.g. that Blokus has exactly 1 of each possible type of piece, where Callisto has an odd empirically determined distribution of pieces). And Blokus seems deeper.

2011-10-28: Played live finally, at Essen with Anna. The plastic set is kind of unpleasing. I like the gameplay still, but she wasn&#039;t thrilled by it.

2012-01-28: I won a copy as 2nd place prize in Callisto tournament in Brzeg, woot! :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>37</numplays>			<comment>Good abstract strategy game. Sort of Chess-like (kill the stationary enemy town on the back row) with a single type of moving piece, but 3-in-a-row of them form a &quot;cannon&quot; which can shoot targets 2 or 3 squares away, and also move as a unit (giving you effectively 3 moves in 1 turn).

It is also realistically possible to win even if you are behind on material (which is a satisfying win!) - position and maneuver are very important!

I mostly play online at Super Duper Games.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>39</numplays>			<comment>A very nice Carcassonne variant.  Being able to place a meeple or pull a meeple to score it, but not both, leads to some interesting tough choices.  The game is more forgiving and arguably less luck-based than the other Carcassonnes because of this: there&#039;s no &quot;majority takes all&quot; in the scoring, and there&#039;s no &quot;my meeple is trapped the whole game in a worthless unfinishable city&quot;.  The new scoring systems for seas and mountains are interesting.</comment>				</item>

Very easy to teach simple rules; nice looking components; fun for newbies; interesting for experienced gamers also; works fine with all advertised numbers of players.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Interesting game with simple elegant rules and some nice strategic/tactical discoveries to make. Short enough that we want to play &quot;just one more&quot;.

The bits lock together in a way we found occasionally annoyingly fiddly (both locking together during play and then unlocking the completed castle structure into individual pieces at the end to clean up). And the plastic feels a little &quot;cheap&quot; and light. But we still enjoyed it. Main complaint is the luck of the draw, but I guess the game is targeted at a filler / lighter / family type audience instead of more hard-core abstract fans. I imagine it will indeed have good &quot;toy value&quot; for fans of Lego and stuff like that.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>It seems much more of an &quot;adventure/experience&quot; game with lots of randomness, compared to K2, which was more strategic and interactive. I suppose it is inevitable that an exploration-themed game, discovering an unknown region, will necessarily have a higher luck factor, for better or worse. 

Tons of bits with good-looking art - we even requisitioned one of my GMT counter trays to help organize the various counters. But it would have been good to have victory points more clearly indicated on all the bits and/or on the player mats.

I&#039;m also not fond of the fiddly rules relating to the camp.

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>Played and bought at Essen 2008.  Almost pure strategy (there is randomness of 5 cards being dealt out in each of the 3 game rounds).  Beautiful components.  Interesting game play that has been rewarding replay with various aha-insights.

My only complaint is the stupid huge box that&#039;s twice as big as it needs to be.  I&#039;m sick of anti-environmental price-increasing over-sized boxes that waste my valuable shelf space and are hard to take to game club to show the game to other interested players.  Lucky for Cavum I liked it as much as I did, or I&#039;d have not bought it because of that damn giant box.

	<numplays>35</numplays>			<comment>Finally played (2008-10-13) after wanting to for a long time.  No luck, no hidden information, but unlike a typical more elegant abstract [[combinatorial game]] Caylus has lots of chaotic interacting subsystems, so it&#039;s like Shadow of the Emperor in that regard.

Very cool game!  The only drawbacks seem to be:
1. Hard to grok all the rules at first.  But after both reading the rules and talking about them, we dove in and just learned as we went.
2. Takes longer than we&#039;d like. (Our first game, with 2 players, took 2 hours.)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Clever elegant combinatorial game with strange patterns of flow and change creating nonobvious strategy and tactics, but ultimately the clever idea doesn&#039;t translate into a lot of interesting fun. I enjoyed it for a few games, but then it slid off my radar.

Lasts longer than one would expect from a placement game on a small grid, due to the frequent captures, but still not [i]too[/i] long on 3x3.

It would be too pointlessly slow and repetitive for me on a larger grid than 3x3.

Trivially easy to make: you just need dice of 2 colors and a square grid (3x3, 3x5, whatever).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Very nice components, especially for such a self-published limited edition type game.  A generic &quot;2 wizards dueling&quot; theme, which I enjoy, but the game itself had way too much chaos for my taste, although it doesn&#039;t take too long to play, which is nice.  I had fun, but wanted to like it more than I did.  For tactical fantasy combat, I think a game like Dungeon Twister is more up my alley.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Early German style game, nifty bits, fun nostalgia for me as I played it back in 1999 and finally reacquired it in 2013. :)

In the end game, you can read ahead pretty clearly to optimize; earlier on, depend on longer range strategy and opportunistic grabbing.

The variable set up of a subset of the price tables and law tiles each game reminds me of Donald X&#039;s Kingdom Builder and Dominion...

Note the rules error in the common English translation on the web: you [i]don&#039;t[/i] choose your new tile from a stack, you only take it from the front stack (conceptually it&#039;s a single very tall stack).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>2010-01-20: Been wanting to try this for a long time. It&#039;s cool, and has no chance or hidden information, hurrah! Like Caylus meets Age of Steam, or something, but faster. :) I want to play more.

Adam and I tried it 2-player, and the system breaks. Maybe it still works as a game, but you totally lose the whole emergent alliance stuff of some people owning shares in a company versus others who don&#039;t. I think it&#039;s not suitable for 2.</comment>				</item>

In the second game with 6 players, I lost 4 out of 8 turns and of course came in solidly last with no hope even for 5th place.  Not a lot of fun being a spectator for half the game.</comment>				</item>

Not sure I like that one bit of hidden info in an otherwise pure strategy game.  The other drawback is annoying tedious setup.  But in practice I like the game, and you seem to figure out what color the other players are fairly soon anyway.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Neat simple 3D game of no chance, with interesting strategy. We enjoyed it and played several times the weekend we learned it (at [[Pionek]]). Big heavy solid cubes.

But the inability to easily see all the faces of the blocks, which is important, is a practical disadvantage for a pure strategy game.

It also seems the random setup can significantly favor or disfavor certain players.

We were taught sort of hastily at the con. The rules are fairly simple and easy to explain, but there seem to be some differences between the German rules we saw there and the English rules I found later online. Apparently the German rules had various ambiguities or holes, and the English rules cleaned them up, I gather. (E.g. do you move your pawn before moving a block? When everyone passes, does the next player get a final turn or not?) This is a drawback, having a game with different rule versions floating around.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Not a game in the normal sense because the rules are ridiculously simple.  You just play the top card from your deck and say what it is, except for certain conditions in which you must say it&#039;s something else.  And so if you play it late night after a day of boardgaming and everyone is sleepy and silly, it&#039;s easy to make mistakes in this theoretically simple task, to the amusement of all. Especially when you&#039;re all trying to play it with the Czech names for the vegetables and bugs.

It only takes a few minutes, so a good game to play anywhere when you&#039;ve not brought a &quot;real&quot; game with you but have a little time to kill.

Continuous space in a game can theoretically lead to ambiguous situations and disagreements, but that doesn&#039;t seem to be an issue in this game.</comment>				</item>

Since you only have five rounds, each decision is very important, and that was hard to fully grok the first time.  Lasted rather longer than I&#039;d like.

	<numplays>56</numplays>			<comment>Great fun WW2 tactical game, playable usually in a couple hours, unusually clear well-written rules, great support in the forum by knowledgable players and occasionally Chad Jensen the designer.

It comes with 12 fine scenarios, but I have particularly high praise for the [b]random scenario generator[/b]. (And I wish more tactical games had good RSGs, or RSGs at all, for that matter. CC has spoiled me and raised my expectations in multiple ways!) I sometimes get the impression I&#039;m the only CC player active in the forum who does not instantly auto-buy every CC expansion! I&#039;m sure the expansions are great, but be aware that if you&#039;re not a completionist, or if you&#039;re just trying to save money or shelf space, then the random scenario generator [i]really does[/i] create an endless supply of great scenarios, so one doesn&#039;t [i]need[/i] to keep buying expansions to enjoy playing CC again and again!

[i]Comparisons with other WW2 tactical games:[/i]
Before CC I was playing Conflict of Heroes with a friend who owned it, and we both found we preferred CC. (But I am rather curious to try CoH again when its true solitaire module finally comes out, and CC&#039;s card-based core makes it notably less solo-friendly than non-card-based games for me, though I&#039;ve tried solo CC a couple times.)

I&#039;ve solo played some Panzer Grenadier, which is an interesting system, but notably slower and fiddlier than CC, so I doubt I&#039;ll ever convince a friend to play it with me, and I prefer CC.

I&#039;ve recently started playing Band of Brothers, which has more simple elegant rules, but lacks the random event flavor and detail of CC, and like most tactical games, alas, lacks any kind of random scenario generator.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Apparently originally CC Europe and CC Mediterranean were intended as a single package, but split apart for practical/marketing reasons.

CCE is quite playable &amp; replayable alone, but most CC players seem to buy CCM as well: more maps, more nationalities, more scenarios, somewhat different/improved random scenario generator!

In any case, an excellent fun WW2 tactical system with unusually carefully well-written rules. Great stuff, well worth trying.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Cool, it satisfies my Squad Leader nostalgia, albeit with a very different (but similar scale) system. Very interactive interleaved actions. Nice components too! (But board warp seems to be an annoying minor problem.)

I started a [[Conflict of Heroes FAQ]] wiki page.

I&#039;ve since tried Combat Commander and find that CC grabs me more. Although CoH is still good, CC seems to create a better sense of drama and story to me, and has more scenarios and a random scenario generator unlike CoH.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>I feel on the fence about CoH. Combat Commander seems better, more fun, more replayable thanks to random scenario generator. Still, CoH seemed interesting when I played a few times and there&#039;s the Polish expansion...</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Hard to categorize combination of abstract strategy game, bluffing game, deduction game...

It&#039;s essentially a chess-like game where you don&#039;t know what your pieces can do, so you ask your opponent if your proposed move is legal, and you take notes using a well-designed dry marker board. Figuring out what your pieces can do is interesting. It makes it take longer to play than a similar more conventional open information game would take, but it&#039;s still playable in under an hour.

The chunky pieces are very nice to handle.

I wish they had kept this new version abstract (as it originally was) instead of tacking on the &quot;cold war&quot; theme with flashy &quot;spy&quot; graphics and giving it a &quot;big box&quot; treatment, but it&#039;s still a nifty game!</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s also a bit aesthetically awkward/unattractive that you mark control of the variously shaped regions with rectangular markers, and that the vertex markers are little balls that roll away too easily.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Like Checkers and Dots &amp; Boxes, this abstract suffers from the &quot;it&#039;s just a game for kids&quot; stigma, with many people falsely believing it&#039;s somehow trivial like Tic-Tac-Toe, but it&#039;s not. E.g. see the ratings of strong players at http://littlegolem.net. It&#039;s not just a guaranteed first player win, or guaranteed draw.

That said, even though it&#039;s a strategically non-trivial game, it&#039;s still not all that exciting to me. :)</comment>				</item>

Nifty game in terms of the 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, ... move protocol which works well to avoid significant first player advantage common to many similar games; here, after each move, the player who just moved is always ahead by 1 stone. This idea can be applied to other games as variants.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A wargame created by a chess player who didn&#039;t know about existing wargames, supposedly. A neat deterministic ancient warfare themed game. I like it.

The only disadvantage is counting your action points up to 20 each turn, and keeping track of which units have already spent how many points.

I played this long ago in college! Got to play it again, enjoyed it, but don&#039;t know anyone local who&#039;s likely to play it much with me, alas.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Played 2-player version decades ago in college, then played 4-player team version at Essen 2008.  Nostalgia!  I want to like this more than I do: having to count up to 20 action points each turn AND remember how many actions each individual unit has spent, possibly while interleaving their actions, is simply cumbersome!  But the bits and map are cool, and I like wargames, and I like combinatorial games, and I like that this game has history, published problems, etc, so I have a soft spot for Conquest.  I am sad I don&#039;t know anyone interested in playing it.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Played this long ago with college roommate, then again in Essen/Spiel, which gave me nostalgia. Not sure if I&#039;d get others to play it though. And there are many versions published over the years, so that&#039;s confusing. But it&#039;s a cool modern classic, and even has a problem book in some versions. Hmm. But Anna doesn&#039;t like it (having tried it at 2 different Essens...)</wishlistcomment></item>

However the gold can cause a big effect in the auctions where a shipment is worth a LOT more for one player than the others. Perhaps it&#039;s a question of personal taste whether that&#039;s a bug or a feature. :) We enjoyed the expansion, and it felt like a reasonably natural extension in the elegant spirit of the original, but it also adds some complexity and doesn&#039;t seem necessary.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s quite clever and thematic for such a simple game, and having 4 different viable alien powers is nifty. Kind of like a 10-minute version of Cosmic Encounter. :)

But you must &quot;pronounce&quot; the solution, as the various possible moves are each a one-syllable nonsense word.  I liked it more than I expected to.  it tests the geek/programmer algorithmic side of your brain and the real-time speed adrenalin part of your brain like Ricochet Robots, but also tests the linguistic part of your brain as you must &quot;pronounce&quot; the solution first.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>This 8x8 predecessor to Epaminondas plays quicker and more tactically. The rules differences (only kill the first piece in a line instead of the whole line; crossed pieces become frozen and can&#039;t move or be killed) seem interesting and give a somewhat different feel than Epaminondas.

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>Unusual 3 dimensional game where gravity doesn&#039;t matter (unlike in, e.g., Connect Four) and all 6 sides of the cube are of equal significance. Pushing the black and white and red balls through the flexible rubber framework (possibly pushing other balls behind it into the following &quot;cells&quot;) is an unusual &amp; wacky physical solution to how to implement such a 3x3x3 game! A little awkward, but it works.

The game itself is fine: try to make a square in your color on any face of the cube. The square could be 2x2, or the 4 corners, or the 4 sides, of the cube face.

I worry about the tree strategy being too powerful. Also it&#039;s an awfully lot of fiddly setup with the many kinds of pieces, which hurts my rating of it. But quite pretty, and fun to play.</comment>				</item>

http://www.transparent.com/esperanto/first_time_abroad_and_at_ijk/ has a photo of people playing Dixit at an Esperanto event in summer of 2011. I have often seen Dixit played at Esperanto events, which is fun, since we share a common language but totally different national cultural backgrounds, so references to old songs and TV shows and such don&#039;t play a role as they often seem to when everyone plays in the same national language.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>159</numplays>			<comment>Fast pattern matching reaction time game... a genre I don&#039;t usually enjoy but seem to be learning to appreciate. This one is interesting due to the mathematical property of the cards (every pair of cards has exactly 1 symbol in common, which you want to find quickly). And it&#039;s amusing that I&#039;ve played it in English, Esperanto, and Polish, sometimes with different players calling out what they find in different languages. Useful for learning vocabulary...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Domino version of Nestor&#039;s earlier card game Mystique Energy. Try to minimize the sizes of groups of your own secret symbols while trying to deduce what secret symbols your opponent wants to minimize.

The port to dominoes is pleasing. They arguably feel nicer than cards, take less table space, and fit together in a grid more easily.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>104</numplays>			<comment>Surprisingly cool game!  The fun of deck-building without the off-putting collectible nonsense.  The central game mechanic is clever and elegant - play an action, buy a new card, discard your remaining hand, and draw 5 new cards.  The couple dozen different types of cards that come with the game are all interesting.  Play with 10 random sets of them, and every game is truly interestingly different.  It really has that &quot;That was cool, let&#039;s play again!&quot; quality.  (Partly that is due to the cumbersomeness of setting up and putting away, though... as long as it&#039;s out, let&#039;s play again!)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Seemingly too-long rules for a pretty simple fun eurogame that was enjoyable to play.  (And calling your extra people &quot;relatives&quot; was just plain confusing.)

In the first half, players put their dudes into buildings.  In the second half, lava starts flowing and dudes flee to escape the city.  The lava flow is a clever combination of randomness and player controlled mayhem to cover or surround other players&#039; dudes.  Good fun (even if the theme is rather morbid if you think about it), especially when you get to throw someone&#039;s dude into the paper cone volcano.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Based on a play 2014-04-09, it seems not quite fully baked. Lower clarity for me and less fun than similar games like Palago and Che, and when camb got a position to win, I then created a long series of obligation moves for him, hoping to draw when the tile ran out, but eventually I ran out of opportunities to oblige him into a forced move instead of his winning placement. Seems to need rule tinkering.</comment>				</item>

Not normally my kind of game, but it&#039;s very short (like a minute or 2 max), so it&#039;s a cute filler. As such, there&#039;s no real reason you can&#039;t play with more than 2 people.</comment>				</item>

The Granna edition has quite nice art and bits, including a hex map variant on the other side of the board.

But the box at least twice as large as it should be, alas.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>2011-02-21: Received in [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/63654/item/1553376#item1553376]Jack Vasel auction[/url]

The rules are not terribly long, but somehow hard to absorb, with non-obvious strategic implications. (That&#039;s good in principle, but a barrier to entry.)

The one game so far didn&#039;t last too long, yet it felt long and tiring.

I&#039;m interested to play again, but none of the 4 others wanted to. :/

The gratuitously weird resources and art are a stumbling block.

I think if I and my regular players were more into heavy thinky economic games, we&#039;d enjoy playing this more.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Finally played once; didn&#039;t live up to my too-high hopes.  The very flashy fantasy art and theme (and the randomness of the facedown tiles and their revelation during play) was a turn-off for what is sometimes touted as almost a pure strategy game.  But I hesitate to rate it.  I still want to like it.

After playing 2 times more at 2009 BGG.CON, I feel like it&#039;s a solid 7. The randomness/simultaneous decisions detract from it for me, but I still enjoy it. The graphics are too flashy, occasionally to the point of being unhelpful. But it&#039;s neat when you pull off a clever sequence of moves!</comment>				</item>

Cool that you can play a 6-month scenario in one session, or start in one scenario and continue to some later scenario, even a full campaign from first to last scenarios.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>OK chesslike game. After a couple plays, it&#039;s not exciting me, though I am open to trying more. Its physical chain gimmick is annoyingly implemented: the 2 players&#039; chains should be different colors to more easily see which chain&#039;s on top. Also people seem to always mis-see how far the long chain can go and try to drag it 2 steps away in the direction it won&#039;t go.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Interesting fun clever little game with simultaneous action selection and nifty auctions between players who pick the same action to see who will get to do the action.

The simultaneous decisions add more luck than I normally like in a game. But I had fun with it and hope to play more at future conventions etc.

Nice quality cards and gems.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>24</numplays>			<comment>2010-01-19: Interesting Eurogame in the tradition of all kinds of wacky subsystems and various ways to earn points. The central worker placement mechanism (of going in one direction along the Nile) is good. We were taught by Sawka and Tusia who&#039;d only played it once a while before, so many rules were shaky. Playing in Polish with German cards detracted from my comprehension of various rules... I really would like to read an English translation of the rules. But the game seems cool.

But it has a bit more randomness than I&#039;d like in this kind of game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>9 modular wooden boards with seemingly arbitrary intersections and curved connections carved into their surfaces. Players have balls and can play a variety of games. We played 2 at Essen; both were familiar mechanisms transported to this unusual board topology: one was a basic Halma / Chinese checkers type game and the other was a placement game of trying to have the largest connected group. Seems a potentially interesting game kit/family.

Somehow the sort of random haphazard looking curve layout was a slight turnoff for us, almost looking like a children&#039;s toy... for me a pure abstract strategy game should somehow look more regular/elegant, but that&#039;s purely subjective of course and probably unjustified snootiness on my part. :)</comment>				</item>

Physical production annoyance: the pieces often make it difficult to tell the type of tile they are standing on due to unnecessarily large margin printed around the perimeter of the tiles.</comment>				</item>

2011-03: After playing a couple more, it seems like with similar-strength play on both sides, it all comes down to an endgame where one person has perhaps 3 left and the other has 2 left and is being hunted down, possibly drawing the game out until someone makes a stupid mistake?</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>116</numplays>			<comment>Pros: unusual idea, building a Rube Goldberg-esque factory with various machines feeding into each other.  Geeky design/layout fun.  Satisfying when you get a good layout built.
Cons: can be cumbersome to rearrange your factory, and sometimes players get confused and forget where things were.  Hassle to set up and clean up, due to many fiddly bits.  Real time auction grab of machines each round seems a little at odds with the cerebral spirit of the layout phase.

2011-05-16: The game grew on me and I like it more, as I played during various conventions since a2na likes it so much. And the new Z-Man edition has nicer easier to use components (yay!) but (alas) a much larger box.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>44</numplays>			<comment>Surprisingly nice 2-player card game. Simple rules, very quick setup, plays in under a half hour.

Nifty system with pyramid hierarchy of 4 colors of cards (each color has its own special power) representing types of gangsters with cute individual portraits of each individual gangster (but the theme is pretty irrelevant).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>30</numplays>			<comment>I like Fendo, which is a bit in the vein of Amazons, Terra Nova, etc (move your dudes and place walls to seal off territory, in this case on a 7x7 square grid).

Nice clean simple rules. Each turn you can move one of your pieces in a straight line, making one optional turn, and then must place a wall on one of the 4 sides of the square your piece finished on.

It&#039;s got a neat core rule forbidding a move which would split the &quot;open area&quot; (containing more than one pawn) into two open areas, which leads to occasional interesting aha-surprises and tricky tactics as a piece. Additionally, instead of moving a piece, you can place a new piece on any square one of your existing pieces could move to. (One player might have no legal move, and so simply passes.)

The game continues until there is no open area (i.e. every piece is locked into its own walled-off area), and the player with more claimed territory wins. Termination with a winner is guaranteed.

You can play it with bits you probably already own or can easily make (e.g. matchsticks for walls), so I recommend trying it if you like abstract strategy games.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Superficially similar to Chad Jensen&#039;s earlier game Combat Commander - same WW2 theme, same designer, same SPI-style clean functional graphics, and an better cleaner rulebook than Combat Commander. Plus they&#039;re both good fun games. :)

But there are significant differences (and not just because FF has tanks). FF is less &quot;cinematic&quot;/chaotic and seemingly more strategic/thinky. The command/activation/order system is fundamentally different from CC, and it is quite clever and cool and interesting.

FF has a few similarities to Conflict of Heroes, e.g. unit facing (for vehicles), randomly drawn damage markers, asset cards.

The only real &quot;negatives&quot; for me so far:
* Many scenarios take longer than I&#039;d like
* FF&#039;s lack of a random scenario generator. It comes with 11 scenarios, and that&#039;s what you get.</comment>				</item>

The only random element is the revelation of the tiles to be claimed; sometimes someone gets lucky as a new tile is perfect for the resources they have stockpiled. I&#039;d be curious to try it with visible queues of tiles sometime.</comment>				</item>

Adds several bits of chrome (with some rules which were unclear as written and sent us to the forum for clarification), but I like the base game perfectly well without the expansion too.

	<numplays>16</numplays>			<comment>The Vietnam war in the COIN system (my first entry into the COIN series). It is quite rich and full of historical flavor, 4 factions. The core turn structure with event cards and the choice in player order printed on the card to do the event or do faction-specific operations is quite nifty and pleasing. Good looking components, good physical quality (and great cover art). Very carefully written rules give me the rare pleasing positive vibe of quality which I get reading rules by Chad Jensen (Combat Commander, Fighting Formations). The excellent manual also includes tutorial game walk-throughs, historical/development notes, event card detailed explanations + tactical tips + historical notes, etc. Works solitaire (human vs bots), 2 player (2 factions vs 2 factions), 3 and 4 player, even interesting to solo all 4 sides noncompetitively. Large number of event cards, so that even the longest scenario only uses a subset of them. The variety of options on your turn can be bewilderingly complex with many strategic and tactical factors to consider. COIN author Volko Ruhnke is active in the BGG forum, answering questions and taking suggestions for rule text improvements/clarifications as is coauthor Mark Herman and bot author Örjan Ariander. All this is great.

Downside? The bot/AI player rules add significant time and complexity and is notably more confusing/subtle to grok than the game rules themselves. Each faction has its own set of operations and actions so there is a lot of detail to remember, even though it&#039;s almost all well &amp; clearly explained. Game length: your first solo learning &quot;short scenario&quot; game may last 5 or 6 hours. (But fear not, experience makes you faster!)

So far I&#039;ve played soloing all sides, solitaire (one side vs 3 bots), and 2-player (US/ARVN vs VC/NVA) and enjoyed them all.

If you are willing to make the investment of time and effort, it is quite a pleasing game, plus an interesting take on the Vietnam war as a 4-faction affair.</comment>				</item>

Not a serious game, but I had fun playing it and liked it more than the vaguely similar Citadels, which seemed more prone to screwing a player with bad luck than this game.

	<numplays>87</numplays>			<comment>On the one hand it&#039;s quite random and chaotic and silly. Not the kind of game I&#039;m normally into!

But on the other hand, it&#039;s fun watching the rules change and the various kinds of card interactions that can occur. For a game with so many unique special cards, the rules are pretty well done without many rules issues in practice. I like that.

And as a 2-player game, it&#039;s quite enjoyable (more planning is possible than with multiplayer) and generally doesn&#039;t last too long! My wife proposed playing it every day for our July 2011 monthly home tournament. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Nice little minimalist game of reading ahead to preserve parity. (It&#039;s an impartial Nim-esque game, so it boils down to parity.) The lookahead exercise is fun if you enjoy that kind of thing (which I do). :)

The proposed physical implementation (writing X or O on paper slips and picking up the stacks of slips to move them) seems a little inconvenient, we found. In practice, I think it might work better with 3 colors of cubes/disks/whatever, and there&#039;s no need at all to stack them: just remove the one you land on.</comment>				</item>

2009-05-24: Finally played it! It uses basic race mechanisms common to many race games, e.g. turn order each turned determined by who&#039;s in the lead. Fun game which rewards tactical planning, but rolling the die when taking a curve too fast introduces a lot of luck (possible effects range from no effect, to minor damage, to wipe out and start next turn from speed 0). Besides that, the game is pure strategy, so such wild randomness on taking curves too fast seems too much to me.</comment>				</item>

When learning, it can be easy to forget about the restriction that you can&#039;t place the color or size which the opponent just placed. It&#039;s somehow easier to remember that you can&#039;t place adjacent to the same color or size (since you directly see the mistake if you do it). :)</comment>				</item>

The rules seem initially a little complex for such a small solo game, and the setup is rather fiddly, but it&#039;s worth it.

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Interesting unorthodox system that&#039;s not too complex, with a beautiful map, but it&#039;s sometimes hard to get 4 people together and finish such a potentially long (but unpredictable length) game, it seems. Arguably too random for such a long game, but this game is so cool that I like it a lot anyway. :)]

I made the [[Friedrich FAQ]] in the wiki.

====

But a complaints about sub-standard markers:

The 110 square markers are very lamely die-cut: They have white side nubs sticking out where they were attached to the sprues, which are very hard to try trimming off, and make the markers look cheap and ugly. :( Most modern game companies know to have the markers attached at their corners, not in the middles of their sides.

(At least the nubs are a bit less obvious &amp; cheap-looking than on my counters from Maria.)

A beautiful game designed with such care deserves better markers than these, which are not congruent with the rest of the game&#039;s otherwise excellent physical design.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s auctioned immediately whenever it appears, so there&#039;s some luck to this: if it appears when only one player has much money, that one player is quite happy. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>I played the Polish version &quot;Futbol Ligretto&quot;.  Very fast silly simultaneous card play, ostensibly simulating a football match.  Basically just fast reactions and luck.  Fun for a silly filler game, although it seems to only make sense for an even number of players.  (But if the two teams have different numbers of players, who really cares? It&#039;s for laughs, not a serious game.)

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Got to learn this from the publisher at Pionek in Gliwice 2007-12-09.  Real-time turning over tiles and choosing whether to add them to your spaceship grid reminded me a bit of Factory Fun, and sure enough FF was apparently an inspiration for this, which removes the occasional too-long pondering and is much faster moving.  Build your ship with various gadgets hooked together, then everyone flies them on a trade run, suffering various random events.  Despite the wide variety of random events, there is clearly skill in the ship design to attempt to handle the various stuff that can happen during the flight.  It was fun and interesting and had some clever ideas; I would need to play more to be more sure of my rating.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Trivia party game that I liked more than many trivia party games. Doesn&#039;t overstay its welcome - only 7 question rounds.

Kind of shoddy components though. The betting disks are thin slippery cardstock - real chips would work much better.

(I also played its original US version Wits and Wagers once, and found W&amp;W to be far too US-centric, to a degree that not just the foreign player but the US players also felt that way. So I prefer and recommend Gambit 7.)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Another elegant Knizia design with tile laying and area control.  I like the twist of counting only your largest connected group of animals in an area instead of just all your animals as would be typical in such games.  Unusually, this uses dice to tell which color of tiles you can place each turn, but the randomness didn&#039;t seem annoying.  There some fun aha-insights about strategy and tactics in the first couple games I played.  I liked it, although when all the bits are thrown loose into the box, it takes as long to segregate them to set up for play as it does to play the damn game, which was annoying.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Little-known Knizia game gets little love it seems, but we enjoyed it fine.

Push a loaded piece onto the center square (which is not necessarily a common event) and unload it, using the potential to get an extra move immediately. Even in our first game, we had some fun situations come up with this, e.g. I made 4 in a row with a loaded piece at the head, unloaded it and pushed the row one more, to reach an enemy piece which otherwise wouldn&#039;t have been destroyed when the row was removed.

Price drawback: only 12 new pieces in the box, whereas the 2nd and 3rd potential sets include 2 sets (total of 24 new pieces) in their boxes.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s like an elegant quick version of Titicaca, in that you place units in areas according to numbered sequence and try to get control of the areas, and also have large connected groups.  I am really starting to actively enjoy and seek out games of pure strategy with random starting positions, and this is a fine example of such a game.

The rules are short and pretty clear.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>Nice straightforward abstract pure strategy game.  Move your 7 pieces (like Ricochet Robots) through a simple maze to get them all to your goal in the center.

At first I thought the 2-player game had boringly obvious moves, and it was more interesting with the chaos of 3 or 4 players.  But after playing it more, I noticed more tactics and decided that 2-player is quite nice and interesting.</comment>	<conditiontext>Limited edition (100) wooden set from Essen 2007, signed by Adam Ka&amp;#322;u&amp;#380;a.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>22</numplays>			<comment>Very cool icehouse pyramid game with Tarot cards for the map! It has the clever elegant unified feel of Homeworlds (e.g. 4 actions: create, grow, move, attack), but in a &quot;fantasy&quot; wargame. Much more sophisticated than the similar simpler Zark City. But it can take a long time e.g. 2+ hours to finish. Games can feel epic.

Nice replay value because whatever random subset of Major Arcana cards (as well as minor arcana) starts out in the 9-card initial map can greatly influence how the game unfolds.

So far only played 2-player.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>629</numplays>			<comment>The abstract strategy game which made me realize I can love abstract strategy games. A new cow-orker taught several of us in the mid 1990s (thanks Rob) and I was hooked immediately. Such surprising beautiful strategic depth arises from such simple minimalist rules. As one of the classics, it&#039;s easier to find opponents in real life and online than for most abstract strategy games, and the simple yet functional handicap system is a big advantage over most games. The long history and huge body of literature and culture significance is frosting on the cake.

While I lived in the US, I went to the US Go Congress each summer and most local tournaments. Now I play lots of other abstract strategy games in addition to Go, but I have no doubt I will be enjoying Go for the rest of my life.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Nice whimsical art and a macabre theme of collecting heads of executed nobles.  A silly enjoyable game with luck and tactics.  Fast simple rules; you pick up a lot of info from text on the cards themselves.

I used to play this a lot in Austin, and then 2008-01-10 in Poland I finally played again, with a German set, and a terrible translation aid that showed the German cards in random order with their Polish names, then you had to look on a second sheet to find the Polish names (again in random order) and the Polish descriptions.  This made the game slower!

2008-11-30: played at Pionek with German cards with Polish descriptions pasted on them.  This did not help me the American nor the 2 Czechs in the group. :)</comment>				<wishlistcomment>fluffy filler</wishlistcomment></item>

Cool strange tactics, potentially long clever chains of jumps, shared pieces. The kind of game whose strategy and tactics are opaque to a newbie the first couple of plays! :)

Also the game&#039;s official website is quite nice with some tutorial info and AI player to practice against. :thumbsup:</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m not into coops, so not sure how to rate this as I&#039;m not really in the target audience. Based on a 3-player game, I enjoyed it more than I expected to, perhaps partly because it&#039;s short and simple/elegant. The communicating only through formal information (&quot;this and this are green&quot; etc) reminds of communication with a Bridge partner, something which I find theoretically interesting but sort of off-putting in practice. I felt like I got to &quot;play with&quot;/experience that kind of formal narrow communication in Hanabi for a much lower time/effort price than if I were to get into Bridge.

I&#039;ve since played and enjoyed it several more times. Not something I&#039;d actively seek out, but it does seem more interesting than traditional coops (which could usually just be a solitaire game with a single player running everything - or an alpha player running the team) due to the limited communication channel. So that is cool.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>31</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;d played AH&#039;s [gameid=68] once or twice back in Austin in the 90&#039;s.

2008-12-06 I finally played the earlier game in this series, Hannibal, with a friend in Wrocław.  Yay!  Real wargaming again!  The first time went slowly, as we kept having to check stuff, roughly 20-30 minutes per turn.  I think of myself as most interested in WW2 for wargame purposes, but I enjoyed the subject of this one too, maybe because of my interest in Latin. :)  I was Rome and won by capturing Carthage.  We&#039;ve since been playing a couple times a month and enjoying it a lot!

2009-04-01: After playing 10 games and still finding it to be a great game, I&#039;m upgrading my rating to 9. This game has acquired special meaning for me. Normally I don&#039;t rate long games so highly, because practically speaking I [i]can&#039;t [/i] play them frequently. It&#039;s too long to [i]literally[/i] want to play all the time, but when I [i]do[/i] have the opportunity to play a long game, Hannibal is always one I&#039;d like to play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Archetypal euro game with various interacting rules subsystems and slapped on medieval theme. I enjoy it! Pleasing that there&#039;s virtually no randomness, but (like Caylus) there&#039;s enough going on that it has the feel of chaos/randomness. And various different strategic approaches to victory.

Too bad the 2-player version is generally reviled. I will happily play it when I get the chance at conventions but won&#039;t own it due to length/complexity and non-2-player-ness.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Main drawback is apparently weak 2-player rules.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Interesting natural adaptation of International Checkers (men move forward diagonally, capture all 4 diagonal directions; kings fly diagonally and don&#039;t have to stop on space right after captured piece) to a square board rotated 45 degrees, which certainly changes things!

It seems more natural to play with the board rotated with corners close to players than to play with the board in usual orientation (sides close to players) and pieces move straight ahead or to the right. Either way, it takes a little getting used to. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>67</numplays>			<comment>A modern classic abstract connection game I&#039;d heard about for a while but hadn&#039;t tried until the &quot;mix and match&quot; online abstract tournament. The 3 different ways to win add a nice race element so that it&#039;s not enough to secure an unbreakable connection (e.g. as in Hex or Twixt), but you must do it [i]faster[/i] than the opponent. The 3 conditions feel a bit arbitrary and there&#039;s wonky details about how the corners don&#039;t count as sides (as they normally would in a connection game) - but it&#039;s a case of &quot;it works well in practice even if it&#039;s slightly inelegant&quot;.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Interesting pleasing core system, but way too long and fiddly for me, I think, and it requires too much specific knowledge of all the buildings to play it competently and rapidly. I found myself continually having to refresh my memory about what building produces what resource which I need to do what again?

It reminded me of why I got sick of programming - too much time learning very specific functions and libraries, not enough general principles. If that makes sense to anyone but me. :)

I admire it but didn&#039;t like it as much as I wanted to, ultimately.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>42</numplays>			<comment>I like the hex tile map building: similar to Fjords, with a nice simple wargame element added.

2 problems (which make me wonder if they even playtested the final version, and compel me to give it a lower rating):

1. The game is seriously hindered for newcomers by terribly unclear text on the cards.  This is really annoying and disappointing.  A game of this simplicity should NOT have so many rules holes and ambiguities.

2. The little plastic soldiers and ships are cheesy quality with small bases, causing them to fall over too easily.  I think it might have been better to use wooden cubes for soldiers and long wooden prisms for ships, or some such.

I created the [[Hellas FAQ]] wiki page.  Read that before playing!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I find Glen More more enjoyable. This has too much of &quot;important cards that you use to turn X into Y are spread among all the player&#039;s tableaus and you need to remember or re-find them&quot; that I am not fond of, but Helvetia is moderate compared to extreme cases like Le Havre. So it&#039;s a playable potentially enjoyable version of such a game for me.

But the physical implementation is really bad:

1. The resource icons are not sufficiently different looking. Especially the brick and wood (which both have a sort of rectangular grid symbology) are way too similar.

2. The male and female meeples are way too similar.

3. The center double-sized tile of villages looks too indistinguishable from the &quot;real&quot; tiles.

Many people we played with all agreed that these physical problems made the game needlessly harder to play.

Also the 2-player version looked sufficiently unappealing to us (having to set up a dummy 3rd village, with a whole page of rule changes for 2 players) that we didn&#039;t even bother trying it... :/

It seems probably a fine game of its sort, but the lousy physical issues and the unappealing 2-player rules make me rate it a bit lower than I might otherwise.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>It has the common impartial game property of an opaque opening and mid-game (since both players have the same possible moves and same goal, there&#039;s no obvious way to play to help yourself and hurt your opponent) until at some point someone can read ahead until the end and see &quot;Aha, I win!&quot; or &quot;Aha, I lose!&quot;

But it&#039;s a reasonably enjoyably quick light game in that vein.

It is cool that the instructions come with various problems to solve.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>314</numplays>			<comment>Wonderful hefty clacky bakelite pieces and a neat tactical game that rewards replay.  Plays quick enough that we sometimes use it to decide who has to wash the dishes.

Unfortunately as players gain experience, the game often leads to a tie result. But then the tournament rule appeared: you can&#039;t play the queen as your first move. This greatly solves the frequent tie problem! Play with it.

Of the expansions, I like Mosquito best.

I created the [[Hive FAQ]] wiki page.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s more straightforward than the Mosquito expansion (which I like since the Mosquito&#039;s power is &quot;meta&quot;), but still an interesting worthy expansion. Unless teaching a newbie, we like playing with both expansions.</comment>				</item>

Update: having now played with ladybug (which seems less interesting to me than mosquito) and pillbug (which introduces a more radical change/concept) I still like the mosquito best of the expansion bugs.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>76</numplays>			<comment>What a weird cool clever game!

Seemingly simple rules, but a little hard to learn due to the abstract nature of the &quot;space war&quot;. And the whole hidden good-vs-evil identity thing is very odd; not sure if I like that. But it&#039;s a cool game which I enjoyed, as I hoped I would, and I hope to try it again, including 2-player (to get rid of the hidden identity weirdness).

Played again twice at Pionek in December 2009, with the &quot;kill the player to your right&quot; variant instead of &quot;good vs evil&quot;, and I think I like that more. A2na enjoyed it too, so we bought some pyramids for ourselves for Xmas. :)

Playing 2-player eliminates the good-evil weirdness, and with multiplayer the &quot;sinister variant&quot; is pleasing (win by killing the player to your left).

Enjoyable to play live and online at superdupergames.org!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Pure strategy game.  Maybe from playing a lot of Tzaar and Dvonn lately, I&#039;m not as into games like Honeypot that have lots of individual pieces with various values and marked hex facings on them, which seems less elegant.  But it was still an interesting little pure strategy game that I played once at BGG.CON 2007 and enjoyed.  Practical problem of cloth map that has creases that won&#039;t lie flat, and round pieces with hexside arrows would work nicer as hexagonal pieces with hexside arrows.</comment>				</item>

Each player has 4 special actions usable once in the game.  Quite nice for 2, 3, or 4 players.  The 3-player version uses a triangular map topology, while the 2 and 4 player versions use a square grid.  Quite nice components, in too-large box.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;ve heard it was an inspiration for Lightspeed. It seems more strategic than Lightspeed (that&#039;s good) but when we played it the first couple of times, it was confusing real-time chaos, with players confused about strategy.

Based on what I&#039;ve read, it&#039;s just a matter of getting used to it, and it seems worth pursuing, since the game clearly has a dedicated following, annual tournament, many articles published, etc. It seems to be part of the Icehouse pyramid culture, for obvious reasons. :)

Meanwhile, for easier to learn real-time pyramid action, I have found [gameid=9386] to be quite fun, fast, and popular! I think I&#039;d recommend starting with it instead of Icehouse.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>33</numplays>			<comment>Real time like Icehouse, but without the continuous space and distance issues. Fast and simple and fun, seems to encourage &quot;just one more&quot;. I&#039;m not normally into real time games, but I enjoyed this more than expected and was glad to finally get to play it!

It is also much more accessible and easily explainable than Icehouse.

I&#039;ve played it at a con and found it easy and fun to explain and play with new players.

It combines real-time grabbing (which I don&#039;t like) and careful listening to distinguish sound subtleties (which I don&#039;t like) as you must shake sealed opaque plastic igloos with various numbers of balls inside and try to guess how many balls are in an igloo. Groan. At least it doesn&#039;t take long to play and so is tolerable as a quick filler.</comment>				</item>

Also seems undesirable that the last player has as much time as they want to choose their line on the card. Several user comments suggest starting a timer after the first player picks; this sounds like a good house rule.</comment>				</item>

2008-03-03 played again.  I still like it, but the strategy is elusive and complex, so I suck at it.</comment>				</item>

The random setup of the order of events gives a big influence on what follows, much more than the random setup of the 6 pink buildings in Caylus.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>After 1 4-player game, it seems like chaotic fun with nicely clear elegant rules (I like that) and tons of special actions on every card (I&#039;m less fond of that). A more complex &quot;serious&quot; Fluxx? I&#039;ll have to play more to decide whether I think it has staying power or not.

2011-08-08: 3 more games (4, 2, and 3-player) in Miodosytnia, and it still reminds me of a more complex Fluxx. Fun, but really big luck swings can happen!

Nice that it seems best instead of worst with 2 players. :)</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Like a jazzed up Fluxx. :) Nice smallish box. But Anna&#039;s not interested, so probably shouldn&#039;t get it.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>A classic social/party dexterity game and ice-breaker. Not really the sort of game I normally like, but great for when among non-gamers.  I don&#039;t really take it seriously as a game [i]per se[/i] since it&#039;s more of a dexterity exercise, so I decided not to bother logging plays of it.  I typically play it at Esperanto events when it happens to be there.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>Very pleasing asymmetric strategic wargame. Caesar starts with significantly more military strength, while Pompey starts with significantly more victory point cities (and is closer to additional neutral VP cities to grab them more easily). So the burden is on Caesar to attack.

For our first few games, Caesar was losing horribly, but as we gained experience, both sides seem to have similar chances of victory, and some games have been very dramatic and exciting. Despite the fixed historical setup, every time has played out interestingly differently, and there are various strategies to try out.

The only caveat is that ships seem more powerful/necessary than I would expect/prefer (and a huge fleet can even attack and capture a lightly defended coastal city with no help from any attacking land units), but my opinion may evolve on that. (I don&#039;t know enough about the war - perhaps this is historically accurate.)

Good simple rules with very little fiddly chrome. Probably quite suitable as an intro/newbie block wargame for an experienced gamer interested in trying a wargame. Certainly a good first block wargame for any wargamer interested in block wargames. Easily playable in 2 or 3 hours max, but also can end sooner, e.g. we had a game end after the 1st year (of 5 years).

-----

After 17 plays, the game continues to show its good replay value (and we&#039;ve still only played with the historical fixed setup) and remains quite fun and interesting. So I&#039;m increasing my rating from 8 to 9. In terms of fun, excellent clear rules, and playability in an evening, this is a great block game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A sort of chess/Arimaa type game. Played it a couple times at IJF 2010 (with its French title &quot;Jeu de la Jungle&quot;). Hard to tell after only 2 plays whether there&#039;s much depth to it or not, but at least it was enjoyable trying it out with Tomio from Sweden!

The 2 rivers create some interesting tactical implications.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>31</numplays>			<comment>Interesting card play and geographical tactics.  I like that the rounds are not independent, and you keep your cards and your placed markers on the map... but that sometimes causes a problem that once once one person is ahead, they&#039;ll stay ahead.  But surprise turnarounds do happen.  Card-counting skills (which I lack) would be useful for playing well.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Game of placing as many of your pieces as you can, analogous to Blokus, Rumis, etc, but the rules here are that the colors on the squares of your piece must match the board squares they cover.  Enjoyed it, and I like that it comes in such a small portable well-made box.

Played again a few weeks later and feel more confident that it&#039;s a worthy [[combinatorial game]].  (I have spent no time trying the many solitaire puzzles that come with it.)

First played at Essen 2008.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Interesting Blokus kind of game with many variant maps.</wishlistcomment></item>

The pieces are just thin cardstock disks, so it&#039;s not as pleasing to play on as the real 8x8 version, but it&#039;s so remarkably tiny and thin that it&#039;s a neat travel version!</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s a bit misleading to have a single rating for Karo, since it&#039;s actually a game kit with several different independent games.  I like to imagine that SCHLEICHER &amp; HÜPFER is like a simple abstract version of Dungeon Twister, and the advisability of keeping your pieces close together as they progress to the other end reminds me of Devil Bunny Needs a Ham (if players were moving their groups in opposite directions).</comment>	<conditiontext>We play it nicely with Carcassonne meeples standing or lying on upside-down Carcassonne tiles.</conditiontext>			</item>

Not-quite professional graphic design: e.g. the tile colors include white, so then the die for colors has a barely visible white dot and uses purple to indicate &quot;wild&quot;, but the die for shapes uses empty (white) to indicate &quot;wild&quot;.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>68</numplays>			<comment>Nice little game! Very simple elegant rules, interesting game play.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/505032/good-short-elegant-abstract-combinatorial-game-of]My review.[/url]

====

The game&#039;s rules have evolved through several iterations since that review.

I&#039;m a bit bothered by the inconvenience of counting the sizes of the largest groups, as in real life this proves cumbersome and error-prone once the groups get large and twisty.

Playing online, the computer can precisely track the group sizes for the players, which is convenient.

This raises a sort of philosophical question for me about how to rate the game, since I prefer playing games as boardgames, not online.

I started playing it fairly often at http://littlegolem.net and I like playing it there. Since I most play online, I raised my rating from my original 7 to 8. But at the same time, this fiddliness about needing to accuratedly count the group sizes is a wart on an otherwise fine interesting game. It&#039;s sort of like playing a computer wargame and the computer doing all the calculations for players, so players start lazily paying less attention to those details - it&#039;s not quite the same as playing a boardgame. Maybe other people who only play games online won&#039;t even think about this issue or be bothered by it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a real-life version of various Flash games of laser beams and mirrors, with tactical chess-like movement, trying to zap the enemy king.  I liked it more than I expected, but it seemed like a risk of deadlock if both players defend their kings too passively with the double-mirror thingies.  But certainly worth playing for the novelty value in any case.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>178</numplays>			<comment>Nice simple almost minimalist rules. Nifty varying powers and ways to earn points and map setup each game.

My only concern is whether the one element of randomness, namely the important terrain card draw each turn, is too much randomness. Possibly house rules can fix it if so. But so far we&#039;re enjoying it as is.

(UPDATE 2012-08-04: we sometimes play with my randomless variant: you simply choose your terrain type each turn. That works fine!)

I believe many negative comments are from people who only read the rules or only played once or twice and overstate the impact of randomness. The early turns are crucial and you can lessen the possible damage of the randomness, but that is not obvious the first time you play.

Played 4-er at Essen, bought it, playing 2-ers at home and continuing to enjoy it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Simple elegant addition gives an additional way of getting points. Nice way to spice up the basic game. In a 2-player game, it probably forces both players to try to get near the capitol to roughly split its points; if only 1 dominates it, it&#039;s worth potentially big points.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Adds some natural &quot;expected&quot; new abilities (e.g. location tile to build on flowers) and some qualitatively new stuff (location tile to place stone wall barriers, and the one-use nomad tiles). Plus 3 new goals (which provide points for doing things in your turn instead of points in the final scoring). A fine expansion though certainly not necessary to enjoy the game. I&#039;d play just the base set first to get used to it before using Nomads.

Be sure to read [[Kingdom Builder: Nomads FAQ]] as the rules are unfortunately inconsistent about whether a &quot;built&quot; settlement means strictly &quot;built&quot; or &quot;built or moved&quot;...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Clever game, hampered by overly ornate portraits (different for each of the 4 players) instead of functional symbols on the nice plastic cubes.  The central cube rolling mechanic to reveal a different character each move is clever and interesting, although a bit cumbersome in terms of analysis paralysis and needing to figure out what&#039;s on the sides of opponents&#039; cubes to help decide your move.  Presumably with experience one would automatically get to know that &quot;OK, the king is on top and joker is facing me, so I know that side has the princess&quot; or whatever, since mercifully and sanely the cubes all have the same orientations of the 6 characters.

Complaint: packaged in larger than needed box.  Other Dr. Wood games I played (Kogworks and Kaleidoscope) had a better focus on usefulness (clean elegant components and not buying a box with a lot of air).</comment>				</item>

Occasional inevitable problematic ambiguities about whether a ship hit another arise.

Light Speed inspired the Looney pyramid game Torpedo which nicely has simpler scoring.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Tried it out at Essen. The basic movement system with momentum on a hex grid, and orbiting planets to visit, works fine (though there are some odd simplifications for playability&#039;s sake, e.g. that you automatically halt at a planet regardless of how fast you were going). The secret goals and event cards introduce a bit more randomness that I&#039;d prefer, and by necessity (given the solar system setting) the large map takes up a lot of table space, so we decided not to buy it, but it was fun and I&#039;d be happy to play it again sometime. Meanwhile it makes me want to go old school and play [gameid=18481] again. :)</comment>				</item>

The rules were too long and complex for what should be a fast simple family game.  The English rules published with it were unclear in places and simply badly translated with bad English, surprisingly so for such a professional looking game with nice looking art and bits.

Some dubious production/design decisions, e.g. triangular prism blocks that are hard to pick up unless you balance them on their triangle sides, and gratuitous black silhouettes of the characters on one side of their stand-up cardstock figures (which were too thick to fit easily into the tight plastic bases, causing tearing of the bases of the figures), making them hard to tell apart if you&#039;re seeing that side of them.</comment>				</item>

The central mechanism of trading cards between your hand and the central queue, which loses its head card and gains a new card at the tail each turn, introduces some interesting tactics. There is definite luck of the draw in what order the cards come out, but still plenty of room for intelligent planning and tactics. I also like that there is not a huge number of various special action cards, but rather a small easy-to-teach set of card types.</comment>	<conditiontext>Received as 2nd place prize in Qwirkle tournament at [[Gratislavia]] on 2012-04-01, yay! :)</conditiontext>			</item>

Area control (most marbles on a board claims points equal to number of holes on the board).

Each move determines the row or column in which the following move must be made. Neat elegant little game. Didn&#039;t read the rules, but looks like it has various variants.

If it had been cheaper, we&#039;d have probably bought it at Essen 2011.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>We enjoyed it at Essen 2011.</wishlistcomment></item>

The pieces have nonstandard promotion values, and every time you move a piece, you flip it over! Fun weird change of pace.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Master Labyrinth is more strategic and better, since you have more knowledge of other people&#039;s goals.  In Amazing Labyrinth it seems hit or miss whether you accidentally thwart or help your opponents, so I feel like why play this instead of Master Labyrinth?  But the basic mechanism of both games (shift the maze, then move) is cool.  As a long-time fan of Master Labyrinth (the good 1991 version), it was interesting and fun to play this earlier version, 2007-10-11.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Alas, not 2-player! Only for 3-5 players.

Very nice art, good simple Clue-like game. We played 4-player (which seems the ideal number since the mystery has 4 aspects to discover) at Essen and enjoyed it.

There is more psychology / bluffing than Mr. Jack (obvious comparison of mystery game from same publisher) as you &quot;invest&quot; in possible clue solutions based partly on what other players seem to invest in.

Also it is a symmetrical game, unlike Mr. Jack.

But it&#039;s not simultaneous (mostly) solitaire like P.I. (other obvious comparison of another Essen 2012 mystery game). You definitely pay attention to what the other players are doing.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Nice short game with unusual historical theme!

I was a translator. (Note that a clarification was added to the Polish rules afterward which isn&#039;t in the English: passengers who were not invited by a player will stay in their train wagons, and might be claimed (along with future passengers) in a later turn.)

Tangential note: I highly approve of Letnisko&#039;s shelf-friendly and environment-friendly small square box; too many publishers put similar games in much larger boxes mostly full of air.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Much more clear elegant system than some Wallace games. Seems it would be very easy to remember and play again after a long time of not playing, e.g. if you get a chance at a convention. But a bunch of cards with unique descriptions to keep track of, and a little bit longer than we normally prefer - in that sense, it reminded me of a somewhat quicker/lighter Le Havre. Very nice components! Played 4-player and 2-player and enjoyed it fine.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Played twice at local con, 4-player and 2-player. A bit longer and fiddlier than we normally like, although possibly quicker with more experience?</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Pros: Good solid chunky square plastic pieces, well-made and indistinguishable from the opponent&#039;s side (which is important in a Columbia block type game).  Interesting tactical game play and bluffing.  I like Columbia block wargames, and this gives a bit of that feel in a much shorter more elegant abstract game.

Cons: Garish lens-flare sci-fi graphics on the board.  Over-sized box: if the board had folded into quarters instead of halves, I&#039;d have bought this game.  But the box that&#039;s twice as long was a turn-off for me with my limited shelf-space and desire to carry games to club meetings.

Played at Essen 2008.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Played and enjoyed, but too-large box annoyed us so we didn&#039;t buy it.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>I read the good reviews and was looking forward to this one for a while.  Finally got a chance to play it twice at [[Pionek]] in September 2008, and I like it.  My only complaints are:
1. The rules have a few too many unclear fiddly bits that require errata to be sure what is meant.
2. It took longer than I expected.  I hope it will become faster with experience.
It seems in a way like a historical equivalent to Neuroshima Hex: a &quot;wargame&quot; that&#039;s really more of a eurogame with a thin theme.  Quite enjoyable.  I want to play more.

2008-11-04: played with a2na, but sadly it&#039;s not her cup of tea.  Too explicitly about real historical war, and too much randomness (dice + cards).</comment>				<wishlistcomment>The initial excitement wore off, and a2na doesn&#039;t like it.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>A little bit more complexity and chrome than its 4-player predecessor Friedrich, but just as playable and interesting, with the same fascinating characteristic look and feel. The rules are odd &amp; subtle (e.g. one must pay careful attention to distinctions of major and minor powers, allied and cooperating and enemy and neutral, etc.), yet pretty carefully/precisely written and not too complex.

The card-based combat system is odd but fun with beautiful stylish components.

I suppose if you like one, you&#039;ll like the other! I like both. Maria seems easier for me to get to the table just because it needs only 3 players instead of 4.

====

But 2 complaints about sub-standard markers:

The 132 square markers are very lamely die-cut: They have white side nubs sticking out where they were attached to the sprues, which are very hard to try trimming off, and make the markers look cheap and ugly. :( Most modern game companies know to have the markers attached at their corners, not in the middles of their sides.

Also why do most fortress markers have fortress on front and question mark on back, but some of them annoyingly have question mark on front and fortress on back? Pointless confusing inconsistency.

A beautiful game designed with such care deserves better markers than these, which are not congruent with the rest of the game&#039;s otherwise excellent physical design.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>17</numplays>			<comment>Fun filler game.  A stark mix of pure strategy (in the decisions of which way to face Assam and where to lay one&#039;s carpets) and die-rolling luck (in how far Assam moves).

The carpet-laying mechanic is nice, and the little carpets made of actual cloth are cute, as well as being a good clever solution to the mechanical problem of stacking carpets partially covering other carpets, so that the two halves of carpets are often at various heights.  (The game would not work well physically with traditional rigid tiles instead of soft flexible cloth.)

Thumbs down for them doing the penny-wise pound-foolish thing of giving 15 carpets in 3 colors and only 12 in the 4th color, so that when playing with 3 colors, no player can choose that 4th color.

After 4 plays, with 2 players and 4 players, it seems the luck factor is too high for me to really take the game seriously, but it is a fun filler game.  First played a couple times 2008-06-05, then twice more at Pionek 2008-06-08.</comment>				</item>

Forget what you think you know about chess-like games! Fun stuff. The strategy seems more interesting than I expected. Need to try more multiplayer.</comment>				</item>

I was sad and hoping for the classic elegant 1991 edition when we sat down to play this at Essen.  We had the rules partially explained to us, and it was not pleasing compared to the classic original.  They should not have added all the plastic chrome, and they should especially not have done so while keeping the same title, which just causes confusion.  This is quite different from the excellent 1991 Master Labyrinth.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m talking about the original 1991 edition here, not the 2007 version.  It&#039;s an elegant clever strategy game of moving through a shifting maze to collect numbered tokens in order.  Serious gamers/adults and casual gamers/kids can both enjoy it.

There is a separate BGG entry for the highly revamped 2007 edition which is gussied up with dragons and dice and craziness that we couldn&#039;t understand from the German rules, but it was too much chrome, and they should have changed the title if they were going to change the game so much.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Note this is the OLDER version, NOT the recent cheesier one with big plastic dragon and other silly chrome and extra rules. See http://boardgamegeek.com/image/94616/master-labyrinth

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Placement game, earning points (tracked by pawns along the edge of the square grid board, which somehow felt slightly odd).

Enjoyable, but felt more tactical/opportunistic; not sure what long term strategizing exists in it. On average, score similar numbers of points per turn; it didn&#039;t seem likely a grand dramatic upset would happen.

Elaborate pricey wooden production.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I learned of this game since my mom has an old copy she used to play with her dad in the 1950s.  It&#039;s a direct representation of classical game theory with simultaneous selection of options from a payoff matrix, but better than I&#039;d expect, and a complete game is playable in less than 10 minutes.  The second phase could be played optimally if one cared to solve the payoff matrix, but I suppose in practice people just pick an option based on intuition and trying to psyche out the opponent.  The first phase (interactively creating the payoff matrix) is more interesting than I thought it would be, and arguably the core of the game, as you both want to make the matrix more favorable for your side - the first part is essentially a pure combinatorial strategy game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>47</numplays>			<comment>Interesting pure strategy game with the clever gimmick that you physically turn the gears to verify that the board state conforms to the rules (e.g. a triangle of adjacent occupied points is illegal).  Try to get a chain of gears from your home corner to the goal corner to win, or force your opponent to lose by not being able to turn their home gear.

More experience gives an aha-experience: the goal is not really to reach the yellow gear (despite the emphasis on that in the rules), but to jam the opponent&#039;s home gear before they jam yours. See [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/350546/gold-kog-unreachable]this forum thread[/url] for more discussion, especially if you (erroneously) think the game is broken and draw-ish.</comment>				</item>

Nice short abstract strategy game where your move restricts where the opponent&#039;s next move must be, in the vein of Synapse Ice and Coffee. Nice hand-made wooden bits. The ability to arrange the 4 board quadrants arbitrarily, not just as a big square, during setup gives good variety.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>123</numplays>			<comment>Seems a fun little &quot;gentle introduction&quot; to Shogi, using only 6 piece types, so easier to learn the kanji symbols and get used to some of the tactics.

After playing about 20 times: yes, it is a good fun way to learn the kanji and get basic Shogi tactics. Some comments complain about draws, but we&#039;ve never had one; most of our games last 10-15 minutes, it seems, but occasionally longer.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s also quite playable with ordinary graph paper and pens, which is nice, or online at superdupergames.org (I&#039;ve been enjoying it both ways). </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>OK tile placement game. Scoring with each placement, a bit like Ingenious. I wanted to like it more than I did. It seemed to lack a certain mysterious spark, as I found it OK but not great, and both my opponents were less impressed than I and didn&#039;t want to play again, though I would have.

The tiles are unnecessarily inconveniently large, which made it awkward to play - we had to shift the arrangement several times each game.

Tried at Essen 2011.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>156</numplays>			<comment>Very clever 2-player puzzle/detective game full of &quot;aha&quot; moments!

Beginners think it&#039;s terribly hard to win with Jack, but that&#039;s false.  The game is pretty balanced once you know what you&#039;re doing.  (See the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/261489]strategy article[/url] by FerrumEtBombyx.)  Newbies make mistakes like trying too hard to escape with Jack instead of keeping all the suspects together and visible.

The only real downside is that often the detective must guess between the remaining suspects in the end, so all the cleverness by both players can come down to a matter of a lucky/unlucky guess.

But sometimes Jack can arrange things so that in the final turn the Detective knows for sure who Jack is, but can&#039;t reach him to accuse him - leading to delightful wails of anguish from the Detective player!</comment>				</item>

But I got it as a birthday gift, and now we&#039;re quite happy to have it!  If you buy it, be sure you ask about the cards since the original printing screwed up and made square-cornered cards.

	<numplays>39</numplays>			<comment>Very interesting!  A truly tiny little game which has a theme and interesting tactics analogous to the original, yet quite different in the specifics, with simpler rules and seems to play in a shorter time. I am impressed. Feels less deep, but it&#039;s nonetheless fun and clever and enjoyable.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A quite random and silly &quot;take that&quot; game that drags on too long.  I kind of wish I liked it more than I do, since the idea amuses me.  Its positive points are:
1. The rules seem fairly clear and unambiguous (impressive for such a card game with zillions of special effects).
2. Often stupidly humorous text and art on the zillions of cards.
I played it once before years ago in Austin, then again at Gumowa Róża 2008-07-01.  Possibly once every few years is about right.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Interesting weird idea of navigating through the 3-dimensioal (number, color, suit) space from one corner to the far corner by a series of 1-step moves (it takes 9 steps: 4 to move from 1 to 5, 3 to move from suns to arms, 2 to move from yellow to blue). The taxicab/Manhattan geometry is tricky to visualize in 3 dimensions!

Seemingly the strategy is to hope to get a midpoint card (e.g. red 3 of moons or crowns) to maximize your later options before and after it. In some sense it seems to come down to luck of the draw, but it&#039;s an interesting mind-twisting experience. If I get more experienced, I&#039;ll pay more attention to what the opponent seems to be going for... as a newbie, the main challenge seems to be maximizing one&#039;s own options and keeping things straight without trying to much to worry about what card to discard without helping the opponent too much. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Fairly simple wargame. I&#039;m not a fan of miniatures, which are somewhat cumbersome to manipulate and require the map hexes to be larger than they&#039;d be with counters.

There are also too many annoying minor vague points in the rules, although overall the important points are mostly clear.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>A bit reminiscent of the (much later) game Mirador: a connection game where lines of sight between placed pieces form the connection from one side to the other.

But the 8x8 board of Network seems small and thus seems to give a notable first player advantage, at least in our games so far...

And it doesn&#039;t seem to be as interesting/deep as Mirador: the board seems too small. At this point, I don&#039;t expect this will be a game I&#039;ll want to play a lot. There are other games with disks on an 8x8 board that are more fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>381</numplays>			<comment>Interesting abstract placement game in the guise of a postapocalyptic wargame.  The only chance and hidden information is the order you draw your tiles (like Cave Troll).  Plus you can set up, play, and put it away in less than a half hour.

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>This 5th army seems weaker and its rules have some unfortunately unclear places, but there is a new ability for a unit to receive friendly fire as an input and redirect it out another direction (or directions!) which is cool, and there is a Grab action that seems neat, sort of the opposite of Push.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Such individual army packs seem a very good idea! No wasteful boxes of mostly air.

The tiles are a nice matte finish, but thinner than the tiles of past NH armies.

The army itself seems interesting. The new gimmick is some units have a reflecting shield which not only stops damage but reflects it back in the direction it came from. And the HQ can lose a hit point to put a special net on any enemy unit. Need to play more to evaluate balance, but so far it won its first 2 games, with each of us playing them once. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Unusual Neuroshima Hex army due to having only 3 units (&quot;objects&quot;) on the board instead of a single HQ! New type of action tile lets one of the objects perform one of its actions (a shot or hit... or a new healing action). Each object has 10 hit points, and if any of them die, Dancer loses. This introduces some different strategic thinking.

Unfortunately it required some new rules on how its weird 3-object-no-HQ paradigm interacts with various other armies, but on the whole it&#039;s straightforward. We only felt significant uncertainty with respect to how it interacts with Steel Police&#039;s steel net.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Fun new expansion army with pretty good clear straightforward rules. The main new concept here is that many units need to be connected to power (from HQ or a few other special power supplying pieces) to work. Easy to grok and clear &quot;plug and socket&quot; iconography for that. A few new special units/actions, too.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played at Essen 2008.  At its core, it&#039;s a rail network building game.  The track laying and money systems are elegant and pleasing.  There&#039;s a clever nice mechanic about buying track from other players that works well.  We enjoyed the game.

But: There are some cards and special effects that add random flavor with some overt environmentalist preaching which I agree with, and some amusing gamer geek in-jokes about Essen being special, but I would have preferred a more &quot;pure&quot; elegant rail game.  The cards have rather busy art, and are dominated by cryptic tables of data only used in the setup, so I&#039;d rather have seen the setup info handled differently.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Fun game, good physical quality, with lower unit count and thus shorter turns than East Front (my main game to compare with No Retreat). So that&#039;s good.

But it has some interesting-but-weird mechanisms which take some getting used to (e.g. the confusing counterblow stuff; the whole initiative thing of &quot;we&#039;re tracking only German VPs until the middle of the game, then we&#039;re tracking only Soviet VPs&quot;; the confusing business about Soviet units being 1-step but upgradable to their 2nd side, then becoming 2-step later in the game; different types of &quot;white strength&quot; units which are immobile fortifications or sometimes not; the needlessly complex explanation about tracking victory points and separate event victory points; etc) and lots of special case chrome to worry about (e.g. the myriad of special abilities for the two sides which become enabled and disabled in various circumstances depending on calendar time and weather, the difference between sea hexsides &amp; lake hexsides matters but is never actually mentioned, etc). (EF has special case chrome as well, probably like all WW2 East front games, but it feels like more confusing weird details in NR to me.)

And as a fan of Combat Commander&#039;s excellent rules quality, I&#039;m rather frustrated and disappointed by the much lower quality of NR&#039;s rulebook. Lots of different vagueness and unexplained things and blatant editing/proofreading errors. Basic stuff which should be covered isn&#039;t like about timing issues when cards are played in reaction to other cards and the usual ambiguities about &quot;play anytime&quot; type cards. So NR simply feels underdeveloped compared to CC. And there seem to be continual tweaks and changes to the system for various game balance and/or historical accuracy reasons, as well as to correct errors (in rules and in scenario info) or unclear rules.

Be sure to download and read GMT&#039;s &quot;living rules&quot; and not just play based on the paper rulebook. At least NR&#039;s Carl Paradis is fairly active in the forum here to answer questions, so that helps. I wish Chad Jensen had been hired to write/edit the rules, though... as it stands, it seems a good game trapped in a mediocre-at-best &quot;work in progress&quot; rulebook. I&#039;d rate it higher if it had a good clear stable rulebook. Probably some wargamers are used to dealing with these issues and don&#039;t mind as much as I do.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Classic quick fun science fiction asymmetrical wargame. (Also a good introductory wargame.) Long ago I played it a lot. It was the first and arguably most influential of the Metagaming MicroGames.

The recent over-produced Designer&#039;s Edition did not appeal to me, but I am happy to own and enjoy the simple classic $2.95 edition again! Thanks for the memories and for the chance to play the classic edition again, SJG!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Nostalgia. In summer 2014 the reprint of the original $2.95 finally goes on sale!

The over-produced behemoth designer&#039;s edition with weird shaped counters and 3-D figures is definitely NOT for me. :)</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>47</numplays>			<comment>Good game, gorgeous Japanese-themed art on the cardstock tiles.

The multiple victory conditions work nicely.

The &quot;lose if you can&#039;t move&quot; makes it feel perhaps like one of those where the opening is somewhat opaque but near the end you can read ahead with certainty to see &quot;Player X will win&quot;. But there is actually some clear strategy as well early on due to the 4x4 grid spatial positioning with threats to make a square or line!

Short gameplay, simple easy rules.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Not a game in the normal BGG sense, it&#039;s a shared storytelling experience that is better if played with people who aren&#039;t focused on winning it as a game.  With people who are in the right spirit it can be a fun activity.  With people who aren&#039;t in the right spirit, it&#039;s boring and annoying.  The cards are useful as a language learning game also.  I can also say from experience that it&#039;s very hard playing with a group of people playing in their native language that you don&#039;t understand very well. :)</comment>				</item>

Unusual theme/art in this nice solo game. Fun, but has drawback of needing to shuffle many times, theoretically you might need to shuffle after every turn, and in practice it feels like you do shuffle after about half the turns, more or less.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Not normally into coop games, but this looks different and surreal and cool. Plus it works solitaire.

And I bought the solo card game Friday in Essen 2011 and enjoyed it.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>48</numplays>			<comment>You must collect the doors in a specific order randomly determined at setup, so that&#039;s harder.

You can permanently spend discarded spells to activate several different spells (e.g. spend 10 discarded cards to deal with a revealed nightmare with no further penalty), so that&#039;s easier.

The 2 changes don&#039;t seem particularly thematically linked, but it&#039;s a fine little expansion. I&#039;ve not played enough yet to know if it makes it harder or easier to win...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>48</numplays>			<comment>A new type of labyrinth card in your deck: 12 towers. They are a second required victory condition in addition to the 8 doors: you also need to have 4 towers in play. If you&#039;re not careful, you may find yourself with too many discarded towers as the game&#039;s end approaches! Especially since you can discard a tower to look at and re-order the top cards of the deck.

Seems a fine little expansion. Mildly inconvenient that the cards are mixed into the main deck, making it harder to play later without the expansion if you are so inclined. Also I found the red towers look confusingly similar to the red doors if I&#039;m not paying close attention...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>39</numplays>			<comment>Playing online and enjoying it. The pieces can move arbitrarily far, but the restriction that your entire set must stay contiguous keeps it manageable and not &quot;chess-like&quot; for me. I find a good strategy seems to be not trying to reach the goal soon, but rather forcing the enemy to capture my stones - eventually I&#039;m reduced to a tiny group (e.g. 1 stone) that is highly mobile and easily runs to the goal.

2010-12-16: Noticed I&#039;d still not rated it, so rated it (hesitated between 7 &amp; 8, went with 7 till I play more). Starts gradually, often leads to intense midgame if one player makes a rush to the goal, otherwise a careful game of maneuvering and careful reduction. Still only played standard version, not Ordo X (which sounds less appealing to me, but who knows.)</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Been playing this abstract a bit on superdupergames.org and enjoying it.</wishlistcomment></item>

2010-01-07: Played several times with a2na during the new year&#039;s event JES and enjoyed it a little more, so I hesitantly increase its rating from 4 to 5. But I still suck frustratingly at it.

2010-12-20: It&#039;s finally grown on me. I played against AI and read about it off and on during 2010. a2na just got it from her Secret Santa and we enjoyed playing a game immediately afterward. I&#039;m looking forward to playing it more with her, so realized my 5 should be a 7. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played 2-player at Essen. It&#039;s enjoyably clever as a simultaneous [gameid=2392] sort of game (disks and cubes as clues function analogously to black pegs and white pegs in Mastermind). Nice &quot;hard boiled detective&quot; style illustrations.

But:

* Seemingly very little interaction (other than indirect interaction of me maybe taking the card you want).

* Unhelpful graphic design. (Suspects, locations, crimes all printed with same color/font makes the cards annoyingly similar looking. The board is rather chaotic/garish/confusing looking.)

* Perhaps inevitably in a hidden info / mystery solving game, there can be a lot of luck in the guessing.

Because of it being simultaneous independent puzzle solving, we would hesitate to play it with many players and have to wait that much longer to get back to your turn.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>52</numplays>			<comment>Played and bought at Essen 2007-10-18.  Very simple elegant pure strategy game with cute theme.  At first we forgot penguins can move more than one space, and it felt like the endgame of Fjordes, and seems fine as a variant!  Then playing it with full mobility made it like Yinsh or Terra Nova.  (I later learned it is similar to the game Amazons, studied by combinatorial game theorists.)  Quite good and plays very quickly.</comment>	<conditiontext>Have the German &quot;Packeis am Pol&quot;... but the tiles &amp; penguins have gone AWOL, leaving only the box! :(</conditiontext>			</item>

Playing online and getting more and more addicted. If you like Trax, it&#039;s well worth checking out Palago; they feel very similar in spirit.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>The rules are fairly clearly written, and the game works OK, so I&#039;m glad I tried it... but compared to some other tactical WW2 games, e.g. Combat Commander or Band of Brothers, it&#039;s slower, and for me there wasn&#039;t extra benefit for paying that price of slower play.

After playing 4 times, I paused; I don&#039;t rule out playing it again, but I personally prefer the gameplay of CC and BoB. Fighting Formations is a bit more comparable to PG (in terms of game length which I wish was shorter), but I also prefer FF&#039;s system.

I can see why some players enjoy Panzer Grenadier. E.g. the leadership system (with random leaders at the start of scenario), and the huge number of scenarios and games available in the PG system.

If you&#039;re interested in the system, check out the impressive fan site http://pg-hq.com

Finally played again in Poland.

	<numplays>44</numplays>			<comment>Like Yavalath, it&#039;s got very simple rules and goal. The strategy is utterly different. Easy to get too distracted by capturing (in &quot;Go mode&quot;) and then - whoops! - the opponent can&#039;t be stopped from making 5 in a row!

The small board (size 5 hexhex) makes us wonder if it might get repetitive but a dozen games in, we&#039;re still exploring and seeing lots of variety in how it plays out.

Try the pie rule since starting on the center seems powerful.

2012-06-05: UPDATE: Playing on the trapezoidal board instead of the hexhex board is an interesting change!
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/811876/published-with-its-original-board

Also there&#039;s more subtlety to the timing issues of capturing than meets the eye. It can take nontrivial time to capture and remove &quot;dead&quot; stones, and that time can be important! That aspect reminds me of the frequent race situations in Havannah.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>32</numplays>			<comment>This classic icehouse pyramid game is much more classically chess-like than Martian chess. Its non-chess-like twist is that you can only move a piece in the direction it&#039;s pointing. And such a prone piece is vulnerable to being attacked, unlike a standing piece (which can only be attacked by a larger piece). Nice classic-feeling game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>At least with 5 players, it seemed way too random.  The lucky players who don&#039;t pick the same destination as other players get a nice advantage.  Once a couple players get damaged in combat, it is hard for them to reequip.  We had several with damaged cannons, so they always lost in combat to the stronger opponents, and could never get their cannons high again.

If you want a pirate game, I recommend [gameid=22287] or (less explicitly about pirates) [gameid=826].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The basic concept of using low-resolution pixel art to give clues is fun.

But it suffers from the problems of all such &quot;Password&quot; style games:

1. You need to guess the exact word. This can sometimes get annoying (e.g. distinction between singular and plural or other variations). It also raises practical problems if not all players are equally fluent in the language of the printed cards. (E.g. me playing with a set of cards translated to Polish.)

2. Someone who knows the clue cards (e.g. the game&#039;s owner) will have an obvious advantage in guessing.

The original edition&#039;s box is an inconvenient cube shape. Apparently later editions come in a more standard portable flat box.

For me, it&#039;s an OK filler to play at a game conventions, but nothing I&#039;d actively seek out.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>78</numplays>			<comment>VERY minimalist clever Shogi variant! Surprisingly interesting and diverse ways it can play out, given the tiny board (3x4) and tiny number of pieces (4 per player). Ultimately a sort of &quot;shogi filler&quot;, but fun.

If you like it, I also recommend checking out [gameid=28389] (5x5) and [gameid=141467] (5x6) which are also small but more open and strategic and varied than this 3x4 variant.</comment>				</item>

The Northern Europe scenario has new power plant cards to replace some existing ones in the deck, which changed the flavor of play a bit but also caused annoying tedious setup time.

Maybe if someone else in our group traditionally set up the deck, I wouldn&#039;t mind it as much. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>After playing a half dozen 2-player games plus a robot, I definitely recommend the robots expansion to make 2-player games [i]much[/i] better, for those times when you don&#039;t have multiple human opponents. There is quite a lot of cool interesting variety in the various robot powers. Good fun! One time the robot even won. :)

You can also play with more than one robot player, but that can get confusing and bog things down.

It is also fun to add a robot to a &quot;normal&quot; game with e.g. 4 human players.

And even possible (unofficially) to enjoy playing solitaire: one human vs several robots.

====

A disappointing problem with this expansion is that some of the robot rules are too unclear/ambiguous (e.g. does &quot;cheapest resource&quot; refer to the cost of a single such resource or the cost for as many of them as a given plant needs; etc) and there are various ambiguous or unspecified situations which arise. And unlike some Power Grid expansion, the publisher/author don&#039;t seem as actively answering questions in this expansion&#039;s forum. :(

So players will need to apply &quot;common sense&quot; and check the rules forum and agree how to interpret some things. :/

This prompted me to create the BGG wiki page [[Power Grid: The Robots FAQ]] which should contain all the collected wisdom from the rules forum.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Nicely done racing game with clever acceleration 3-sided dice system.  Nicely done modular maps and flexible race course design, plastic boats, cheesy cardstock buoys that fall apart and fall over.  We all enjoyed it but also all felt like it&#039;s not the kind of game that makes you want to play it again right away.

After my 2nd game 3 months later, I think I want to like it more than I do. The system is too catastrophic in the sense that a random difference of one die point often has huge consequences. I wonder if I&#039;d like it more if it was a pure strategy game, in which you choose your dice rolls.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>Portal makes an economic worker placement game about the fashion industry, with art of women in pretty dresses instead of zombies and mutants shooting each other?! :)

Played once at Pionek 2010-12-04, and we enjoyed it a lot. Good serious game, well worth checking out. We hope to play more, even though the Polish card text slowed me down a lot. But I think with more experience I will know the cards pretty easily anyway. As usual in a game with lots of cards with special actions (especially from Portal) there are various murky rule ambiguities...

Played several more times and continued to enjoy, although it&#039;s longer and more complex than my preferred type these days (and has that element of &quot;everyone has various special cards that do special stuff in their tableau and you should keep it all in mind if you want to play well&quot; which I find I&#039;m not so fond of, e.g. in extreme cases like La Havre). But the core system works fine and is enjoyable.

The 2011 Essen release version apparently improves the rules, definitely improves the board layout problems, and supposedly makes the cards non-text-dependent with icons which clearly represent what they do. I&#039;ve not tried this version yet but heard positive comments from some who have.

2012-01-09: Gave 2nd edition to Anna for Xmas (delivery delays).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>160</numplays>			<comment>After seeing it and for some reason not being interested for many years, I finally played it in the logical games tournament at [[Pionek]] 2008-11-29 and was impressed.  Interesting elegant game!

Now we own it (as of Christmas 2008) and play it a lot.  It&#039;s short enough that we want to play &quot;just one more&quot;.  It  [i]seems[/i] so simple, yet often surprises.  The strategy remains subtle and nonobvious as I keep losing more than my fair share. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>81</numplays>			<comment>Got to play once at Pionek 2008-06-07.  Surprisingly interesting (the fancy packaging and components made me wonder if it was going to be more flash than substance).  Now I read it&#039;s an early Kris Burm design.  No wonder the gameplay was interesting! :)

The gameplay is different from Burm&#039;s more well-known Gipf series, which mostly have a small number of types of pieces.  In Quads, every piece is unique.  In a sense that feels less elegant to me, but I still like the game!

A placement game - in a loose sense analogous to Blokus (each player has their own set of diverse unique pieces to place).

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Enjoyable game of &quot;keep moving (jumping onto enemy pieces to replace them) until you lose by not having a move&quot;, where the number of spaces a piece moves is equal to the number of friendly neighbors (so an isolated piece is immobile, at least temporarily).

The movement rule feels very natural and elegant, yet not used much in other games that I&#039;m aware of. Feels sort of like TZAAR meets Lines of Action, but not really. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>50</numplays>			<comment>Some criticize it for being a sequence of mysterious moves until suddenly you can read ahead and see how to win (or that you&#039;re doomed to lose), but I find that entertaining. Plus it&#039;s quick to play.

It is fun to play with the advanced rule that a 2x2 square also wins, not just 4-in-a-row.  And then to play that ANY square wins.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>32</numplays>			<comment>Similar to Pentago in terms of goal and rules (tic-tac-toe for 5 in a row with moving board squares) but more complex strategy.  I liked it more than I thought I would, and found myself wanting &quot;just one more play&quot;.

However there is a practical problem about the covered-up spaces - is Quinamid meant to be a memory game (in which case you can accidentally see hidden information when rotating levels) or not (in which case it&#039;s a pain in the ass to see what&#039;s hidden under the levels)?  I was surprised that the rules are silent on this, and the designer/manufacturer hadn&#039;t thought about this issue.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Neat wooden abstract strategy game. It just bugs me about the rules ambiguity whether you can see spaces hidden under the levels or not. :)</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Enjoyable short game to get 5 in a row, and very fast to learn the rules. It&#039;s sufficiently interesting that we played 8 times in a row the first time, but it doesn&#039;t seem as interesting or unique as some other Gigamic games, e.g. lacking the 3-dimensionality of Pylos and Inside.

I did notice that our early games ended quickly, with plenty of blank cubes still in play, then we got better and entered a sort of next phase of play with all the blank cubes gone, or only in the interior, and the feel of the game shifts then. That was cool.

But it feels like just waiting for the opponent to make a blunder. Maybe my rating will change with more plays and experience and insight.</comment>				</item>

It is best as a pure 2-player strategy game.

I&#039;ve played it 4-player and found it more amusing than I recalled from long ago, despite it being less strategic and more diplomatic.  But 2-player is still best.

	<numplays>32</numplays>			<comment>Very short small fun filler game of simultaneously deciding which card to play until someone has won 4 card pairs, thus it&#039;s a game of psychology + luck + calculation. It gets an admirably clever high amount of mileage from 2 identical decks of only 8 cards!

A game can be over in 2 minutes, so it seems like one often might want to play a series of games, not just one.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Fun little maze/race game. The setup phase is a bit long and (perhaps not obvious at first) very important strategically. (Perhaps like the game 9tka in that regard.)

It&#039;s easy to achieve or even start with multiple clear routes connecting opposite sides, so blocking is a crucial tactic! I.e. it&#039;s not &quot;just&quot; a race, but includes a lot of jockeying for position and deciding when is the right time to exit a dwarf, because once you&#039;ve exited a dwarf, you become weaker on the board (you have less ability to block)! In that sense, it reminds me of YINSH, where you have to remove 3 rings to win, but each ring you remove makes you weaker on the board.

Several steps of &quot;aha&quot;-experience in our first few games. :)

The 3-player game of course, like many such games e.g. Quoridor, has the anomaly that 2 players face each other while the 3rd faces a neutral side.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>102</numplays>			<comment>Short fun abstract strategy tile placement. Works for 2 or 3 players, easy to teach, thus a good filler with new players, yet remains interesting for more experienced players.

New players may have trouble visualizing the overlapping regions of same-colored circles and same-colored squares. Multiply the sizes of your 2 largest circle and square regions, so overall strategy is clear, another plus for impromptu games with newbies: you want to increase both your circles and squares roughly equally rather than increasing one a lot. E.g. 8*8=64 is better than 4*12=48. It&#039;s not highly deep, but for a nice 10 or 15 minute game it presents sufficiently interesting tactics and strategy.

As we gained experience, ties became more common in 2-player games.

The tiles are not quite as nice as in most nestorgames: different colors have slightly different thicknesses, the circles are not always centered correctly, but that doesn&#039;t really affect play.</comment>				</item>

...but now I&#039;ve invented Ricochet Pyramids, which we enjoy just as much. :)</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>41</numplays>			<comment>Sort of Dominion with combat... Fun, and nice that it has 4 different scenarios (defeat a tough enemy to win, kill opponents to win, get rich enough to build a monument to win, and even a coop scenario where you must all survive until the event deck runs out to win). 4 different factions with their own units with special actions. So plenty of diverse gameplay. Quick game, rarely more than a half hour.

The rulebook is sometimes sloppily written, so I was motivated to create [[Rune Age FAQ]].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>It is ultimately a fancy version of Yahtzee. Fun in a solitaire kind of way, but too long (and complex!) for what it is, and it dragged on way too long with 5 players. The only apparent interaction is in the choice of whether to accelerate or decelerate the arrival of pirates.

Dry erase markers on the board seemed weird to me, like they were just saving costs by not giving you the various physical bits which would normally come in a game like this.

Very good art though! Everyone I played with seemed sincerely pleased with the art.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>41</numplays>			<comment>A Knizia classic.  We used to play this a bunch in Austin years ago.  Nice abstract strategy (with a few euro-ish special effect tiles thrown in) with strangely cool appealing shiny black pieces made of some mysterious alien carapace.  Place your tiles to gain control of the pieces of alien carapace in Japanese cities.  The final scoring is wonky and weird in an interesting Knizia way. (Watch out for different rules versions about what happens if nobody has the most of a figure type: no winner, or most total pieces wins.)</comment>	<conditiontext>Won at Pionek, June 2008 by a2na for winning the logical games tournament.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>First played 2007-04-09.  Vaguely reminds me of Web of Power.  Gorgeous map. The core cardplay mechanism of splitting into groups which other players pick from is cool and makes for some very interesting tough decisions.  Annoying misdesign on corners of score track.  The expel action seems too wildly random compared to all the other actions, which are completely deterministic, but I still like the game.</comment>				</item>

Random draw makes it less appealing to me than similar pure abstract strategy games. But the pieces are delicious looking. :)</comment>				</item>

Tactical maneuvering to roll the blocks into pits was initially opaque until we got the hang of it, and then it was just a race. I can imagine there being deeper strategy to it, but it didn&#039;t grab us enough to try a second game, alas.</comment>				</item>

We thought it would be a trivial game (analogous to 3x3x3 Tic-tac-toe), but the need for 4 in a row combined with the gravity of dropping the disks to the lower level in a column seems to make it sufficiently interesting.</comment>				</item>

Elegant rule system.  Pure strategy except for the player-induced chaos/randomness of hidden movement.  One can and should think carefully.

I&#039;m not so into the team-vs-one aspect.  For the detectives to win, they really need to cooperate and plan carefully as if they were one player running a set of detectives, while I tend to think of team games as a bit lighter and more social.  It&#039;s also more abstract/dry than Mr. Jack (another chase-themed game).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>427</numplays>			<comment>Truly excellent classic centuries-old strategy game. Similar to familiar International Chess, yet also very different.

Being able to drop captured pieces back onto the board [i]really[/i] changes things in an interesting good way. And most pieces can be promoted, not just pawns.

After years of thinking about Shogi from afar, procrastinating due to the initial kanji learning hurdle, I finally bought a set in late 2011 and was pleasantly surprised how quickly we got used to the kanji. We started with [gameid=28389] to get used to the kanji and basic tactics, and then soon started enjoying full Shogi. For learning, there are in fact multiple small board variants using subsets of the pieces, all worth trying out.

Of possible interest: [geeklist=196102][/geeklist]

===

There are various variations of the pieces (e.g. with 1 or 2 kanji symbols; with red or black symbols on the promoted side; with neat regular &quot;printed&quot; kanji or less legible sloppy &quot;hand-written&quot; kanji; slightly different symbols in printed diagrams in problems and strategy articles)... This is an annoying barrier to entry for people who don&#039;t know kanji already. (Imagine if International Chess pieces were all just tiles with the English words &quot;pawn&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, &quot;rook&quot;, &quot;knight&quot; etc printed on them, and different sets used different typefaces and handwriting styles, and sometimes printed &quot;tower&quot; and &quot;horse&quot; instead of &quot;rook&quot; and &quot;knight&quot;, and you were someone who didn&#039;t already know the Latin alphabet...)

Too bad, because Shogi is great and deserves more attention! Instead, it remains less well-known than Chess (outside of Japan), in contrast with Go (which does not have this technical barrier to entry, its pieces being simply black and white stones). And so you usually need to mail-order shogi books &amp; equipment instead of seeing them in most local bookstores and game stores.

But it&#039;s worth it. Great game. :)</comment>				</item>

Lots of rules subsystems are more fiddly than I prefer, and the art is love-it-or-hate-it garish. But if you like medium to heavy economic games with a good strong sense of theme, well worth checking out.

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Played a few times during IJF. Quick and clever idea, nice attractive bits. But the game play was ultimately not so exciting to us. At least it does indeed seem to work fine with 2-4 players, though of course (as in all such games) it&#039;s more purely strategic with 2.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>42</numplays>			<comment>Simple Shogi is extremely small, 3x5 and 4 pieces per player like Dobutsu = Let&#039;s Catch the Lion, but Simple Shogi uses standard Shogi pieces and rules, so is arguably better for learning the basics of Shogi.

It&#039;s unusual among Shogi variants for having players start with 2 of their pieces in hand, instead of all pieces on the board.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Neat! Skurðir is an abstract Age of Steam, similar to how Homeworlds is an abstract Twilight Imperium. :)

Like in Age of Steam, you want long convoluted routes, and most of the goods/passengers start on the map so you can imagine long-term strategy and route-planning from the beginning. Unlike those games, Skurðir is playable in a half hour or so.

One minor drawback is that it can be a pain computing the payout costs on long routes with lots of colors on the way.</comment>				</item>

Bummer. Usually Gigamic rules are clearer. Based on the rules supplied, we&#039;re not impressed. Possibly there&#039;s a good game here if we learn how it&#039;s intended to be played.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Playing this, I thought &quot;This seems like [gameid=7553]&quot;, then I come to BGG and see that it is a reimplementation indeed. :)

The varied random setups are nice. Pretty wooden pieces.

It&#039;s another of those games where the beginning feels opaque, but near the end you can read ahead with certainty and see &quot;Player X wins&quot;. (But I have read that there is some known algorithm which solves Babylon.)

Nice quick filler. Seemed pricey for what it is, though.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>58</numplays>			<comment>The &quot;State of Siege&quot; system never quite appealed to me as it seemed too random sounding, but I got the C3i magazine with this game (nice production quality, by the way) and darned if the game isn&#039;t addictive &quot;just one more&quot; fun! It can be over quite quickly if luck goes against you (e.g. in just a few minutes), but it&#039;s so easy to set up and just play &quot;one more&quot;. 

I&#039;m interested in the Russian Revolution, so this was the State of Siege game that sounded most appealing to me. The game has lots of historical flavor on the cards, and a good accompanying historical article if you have the C3i issue edition. Pretty clear well-written short rules. (I created [[Soviet Dawn FAQ]] to cover a few common questions.)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Only played once 2007-09-11.  I don&#039;t generally like real-time games, and in a game with various fiddly rules, the real-time pressure makes it especially chaotic for first-time players.  It seemed OK for that sort of thing, and it was fun to try once to see what the hype was all about, but I feel no urge to play it again.

A practical problem is that the sand timers didn&#039;t all run for the same amount of time, which seems an inherent problem with any game that depends on multiple sand timers owned by players, like this or Tamsk.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>22</numplays>			<comment>Similar style &quot;place tiles in an unbounded grid to achieve a pattern&quot; to David Smith&#039;s Andantino and his more famous Trax. This one is distilled down to a really minimalistic ruleset, both the placement rule and the goal!

Interesting how we find it harder to see patterns on a triangle grid; we are so used to playing games on square grids and hex grids, but triangle grids are quite uncommon.

The nestorgames edition has pleasing laser-cut tiles which have amusingly sharp corners and edges, like 50 little weapons. I&#039;d almost be afraid to fly with the game in the US for fear the insane TSA would confiscate the sharp-cornered pieces. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>Odd go variant with square pyramid stacking. The rules seem an elegant natural extension of go to this environment, yet they are a bit hard to wrap one&#039;s head around somehow, and the strategic/tactical implications of the stacking are surprising! Add to that the weirdness of playing on the tiny 4x4 grid instead of a larger grid (as the original Margo proposes).

Like go on drugs. :)</comment>				</item>

The PDF rules v1.1 doesn&#039;t clarify that you can remove a red ball that supports one other ball, but the BGG wiki description does.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>It has fewer cards and fewer symbols (which are all animals) on cards, to make it easier for kids. But several animals look too similar (e.g. dolphin and shark and whale all have a very similar shape and blue color), which seems counter to the goal of making it easier for kids.

Still, I guess kids would enjoy it OK. For me (an adult), it&#039;s OK for a change of pace, but I liked it less than regular/original Dobble / Spot It.

Maybe I&#039;m just used to the original art? But I liked Loonacy (similar game) fine, despite it having different art from Dobble / Spot It.</comment>				</item>

The laser cut counters and mounted boards of this 2nd edition are nicer than the 1st edition. The rules have more chrome, e.g. cloaking ships, flagships, planetary fortifications and assault, etc.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Wow, we liked it more than we thought we would, after hearing how it was some devolved version of Age of Steam. We played with the full AoS style auction system. The chance-free production system seems better! The tile-laying costs do seem more elegant, once Petr pointed out the unifying logic behind them.

However we found the hieroglyphic role tiles to be annoying and hard to get used to, and the map&#039;s naturalistic art is prettier but provably less functional (as Macike got confused over whether a certain hex was mountain or not). Nice that it comes with 2 standard maps instead of 1. Need to play some more.

I have read various of the criticisms, and some seem valid:

1. Steam is more tactical and has less long-term planning because of the new production rules.
2. Steam&#039;s urbanization may be too powerful.
3. Issuing shares seems less costly, and possibly creates a runaway leader problem as a result of the ability to keep raising cash by issue shares once you&#039;re out of the hole and always win the auction while other players struggle to have cash.
4. The split VP/income tracks means whoever starts earning VPs first will probably win the game, and that ultimately only the final runs matter for victory. In AoS all of your runs have some direct effect on your score in the end.
5. Points for links instead of track removes minor tactics of building more track for points, using engineer, and urbanizing to cost someone track points. It seems done only to save time in scoring.

Maybe the best option is simply to play AoS with insta-production like from the London map?</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Played against the AI at http://www.zoo.co.uk/~z8001271/stlts/stltshome.html and it seems interesting. Vaguely reminds me of TZAAR, where you stack to be more powerful or move to capture; in Stlts you add pins to move farther or move to capture. But in Stlts a very fast piece is still capturable by any piece in range, so that&#039;s a big difference.

Unsure how much I like it. Adding a pin is normally much stronger than moving.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Basic game play is similar to standard Fluxx, which we seem to play more in practice. (This one has a fair amount of atmospheric stoner slang that&#039;s more of a stumbling block for non-native English speakers.) One interesting difference is that one particular keeper has many instances.

There are several cards about doing real-world actions, which is less pleasing to me in a game.

I applaud the real-world political agenda of the game and part of its proceeds.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>Nice clacky L-shaped tiles with various color combinations on the 3 squares of each tile. (which don&#039;t stack quite as perfectly as they look like they should) with a Taluva-ish rule that you can cover existing tiles, if you cover at least 2, not just 1. The restriction that you can&#039;t cover one player&#039;s color with the other player&#039;s color is good and works. (There is a 3rd neutral color.)

Score = size of connected group * maximum height of the group, for your single best group.

The standard game has you play tiles in a random order. There are several variants. We were surprised there was no pure strategy variant, i.e. simply choose which piece you want (like Blokus, Quads, Zaic, etc). We tried playing with choice (no randomness) and it seems to work as well!

NOTE!!! There IS a luckless variant! It&#039;s just mistranslated into a random variant in the English [i]and[/i] Polish rules! See [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/873602/inconsistent-rules-translations-there-is-a-luckles]my thread about the mistranslated variant[/url].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Programmed movement of RoboRally combined with role selection each turn (e.g. Puerto Rico, Citadels, etc).  Chaotic, fun, not too long, not too deep.  (Played 3-player version twice.)  Certain roles are much more useful/important than others.  Nice art and physically high quality components, especially for a self-published limited edition game, but a graphic design problem in card design forces you to spread your hand of cards to see their values.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Cool pieces, cool idea; not sure how well it comes together in practice. Also the rules are noticeably more complex and less clear than other nestorgames. The idea of having a basic version and an advanced/full version is fine in principle, but in practice it means a lot of stuff you learned must be unlearned and it was cumbersome to look up questions.

Chess skill seems useful here, as my chess-playing friend demolished me multiple times. :)</comment>				<wishlistcomment>An interesting looking abstract strategy game with vaguely Magic The Gathering war theme.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Addictive tile placement track-building game.  Played a lot years ago in Austin with first white-tile edition.  At Essen 2007 played with new edition with cheaper-feeling plastic red tiles and new plastic board with different layout of the bonus exit points.  Doesn&#039;t look as nice to me, but they improved it by having you draw from a sack, since the original rules were annoyingly unworkable with pulling tiles from a prebuilt block, since you could see the edges of the tiles and know what you were pulling.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>The original set with the ivory colored Bakelite tiles is cool and definitely more desirable... :)</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Looks nice at first, but didn&#039;t quite grab us in the end. Ultimately a crossing game with a small number of pieces on each board; not sure how much staying power it would have. We tried 2-player at Essen and found it felt a bit contrived playing on 3 boards.

Also (nitpick alert!) I was annoyed that the pieces looked so great on the outside, but looking down at them during play I could constantly see the big ugly molding seam inside the hollow part of each piece. If I would pay for a game with classy looking GIPF-project-like plastic pieces, I would want them to really look good everywhere I can see them...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>73</numplays>			<comment>Once upon a time several years ago we were turned off by this game after an incompetent explanation by someone at Essen.

But I was curious since people praised it, so finally we played it again at Brzeski Festiwal 2010-01-31 and liked it enough to impulse purchase it that very day. Nice simple clear elegant rules - I don&#039;t know why the explainer had such trouble explaining it to us at Essen. :)

It&#039;s one of those games where the strategy seems quite nonobvious the first time you play. That gives us a fun sense of aha-discovery. And it seems to work fine with 2, 3, and 4 players (with different feel for different number of players).

Plus the tiles are really thick and chunky and sturdy and nice feeling.

Finally, the game is very quick to set up and put away, and doesn&#039;t take too long to play. A big plus for us!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>143</numplays>			<comment>Placing tiles to form as long a line as possible in your color, earning double points if you close it into a loop.  The loop scoring sometimes creates a very interesting tough decision (Is my line big enough to close and probably win with its points?  Is my opponent&#039;s line small enough that I should close it and double its score?)  Very pleasing bakelite tiles, and it works well with 2, 3, or 4.  The extensive rulebook with solitaire and puzzles is a nice bonus.</comment>	<conditiontext>Bakelite tiles in a pouch = pleasing.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>50</numplays>			<comment>Played a couple times at Essen 2006 and enjoyed it.  And again in Essen 2007.  No chance or hidden information, but it didn&#039;t feel that way, interestingly.  Interesting endgame tactical subtleties can cause big swings.  I like playing green in games, so I&#039;m annoyed that they do the pseudo-clever cheap thing of giving fewer number of player pieces of some colors, so that green is only usable in a 4-player game, and not in 2-player which is how I usually play games. But a guy at Essen gave me the necessary extra green dudes, hurray.</comment>				</item>

After a long hiatus from Columbia block games, this is the first one I&#039;ve played in years. EastFront&#039;s still the best and classic. But I give Texas Glory bonus points for being about Texas history, since I&#039;m from Texas. :)

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I like the core mechanism of moving and spending time on various tasks. This felt like it fit the theme well and leads to genuine strategizing and non-obvious decisions.

But the random draws for digging are ridiculously too variable. This also fits the theme, but in a different incompatible &quot;light fluffy&quot; way that clashes with the weightier strategizing of the map movement.</comment>				</item>

I don&#039;t know if it will have a lot of staying power (given that it&#039;s a 3x3 grid, after all), but it&#039;s surprisingly nice and interesting as a short combinatorial game mini-brain-burn filler. Depending on how many trees (creating many possible 3-in-a-rows) vs nests (not as many) there are, it can play out interestingly different!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Very fast to explain and play. Simpler scoring than Light Speed, plus the fact that it can be played simply with a pyramid stash for each player instead of needing a dedicated set of cards, makes me think I&#039;ll prefer this to Light Speed.

Because of the continuous space instead of a grid, occasional inevitable problematic ambiguities about whether a ship hit another arise.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A checkers variant with attractive &quot;native art&quot; style turtles.  A jumped piece is flipped onto its back and temporarily neutralized, then the next time someone jumps it, it joins their side.  A practical problem is that the turtle backs are round, so they rock inconveniently when on their back, and the turtles are a bit too large for the hexes, so crowded areas of the board become cumbersome.  Possibly a good checkers variant, but the practical issues turned us off.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>26</numplays>			<comment>Pretty Tuscany-inspired art on the tiles.  Quick playing enjoyable strategic placement game with randomly drawn tiles, sort of a mix of Cathedral and Tantrix.

The thin cheap plastic white scoring disks for the sort of cumbersome scoring are a pain to pick up off the tiles, and not up to the same aesthetic standard as the tiles and board.

2010-10-18: We have started playing it with no luck: simply choose what piece you want to play each turn from your entire set. We prefer this way! This caused me to change my rating from 6 to 7.</comment>				</item>

Perhaps a bit too boiled down, since everyone shares the same track and it sometimes feels like it&#039;s rather arbitrary who ends up getting all their cities connected first, but it&#039;s a nice occasional filler.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>229</numplays>			<comment>Played some online and decided to buy it 2007-06-30.  2-player pure strategy game of tile placement to close a loop or make a long line meeting certain conditions, with very simple rules and pieces, but non-obvious strategy.  When I first encountered Trax, I thought its rules and components were so simple that it couldn&#039;t offer much diversity, but it seems to.  I&#039;ve seen plays of it develop in quite different interesting ways.  It also makes a huge difference whether you play with unlimited tiles and grid or restricted to an 8x8 grid; both are interesting, in different ways.

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>Enjoyed playing with the designer at Essen 2007!  Cool concept of the continents drifting apart, nice clean clever system with some aha-tactics.  I&#039;d played a couple times years ago in Austin and was eager to try again at Essen, and was not disappointed.

The 2-player version is OK but less interesting than multiplayer, which adds additional tactics as intermediate scoring happens when islands are formed.</comment>	<conditiontext>Signed by Ralf Lehmkuhl.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>98</numplays>			<comment>Played a lot in Essen 2007, and bought it.  My first reaction is that it&#039;s my new favorite of the Gipf project, and many plays later, that&#039;s still true.

I like pure strategy games with a random setup, which Tzaar has.  (There are 2 variants included for people who hate random setup.)

It seems to have a higher variety of qualitatively different possible higher level strategies than the other Gipf games.  I have played in games ending by each of the various possible victory conditions (opponent runs out of any of the 3 kinds of pieces, or can&#039;t move).

Some people dis the Essen prototype for looking bland, but I actually like the board a lot.</comment>	<conditiontext>Signed Essen copy 736/1000.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>The core of the game is real-time competition at fitting irregular pieces onto an irregularly shaped rectangular grid.  When you get into the zone and are doing well, it&#039;s fun and satisfying and an adrenalin rush.  But there are silly intricate scoring rules that break that energy flow.  Better to ignore their scoring system and just give a point to the person who fit their pieces first (we do that by letting them keep their tile while everyone else tosses their tile aside), and rush through all the tiles in rapid fun.</comment>				</item>

The box is too huge for the components, so there would have been room for bigger tiles.  [gameid=34969] is still our favorite.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>28</numplays>			<comment>Good small portable box.  We like it more than original Ubongo.  This one&#039;s all about solving the puzzles in frantic real-time, with no lame tacked-on weird scoring stuff. Each player solves the exact same puzzle (same map, same pieces) as the other.

And the puzzles are harder (in a good way)!

On the downside, some tiles don&#039;t fit together easily (tab in slot too snug), and the black plastic insert has 2 spaces to hold the 2 bags of pieces but these spaces are a little too small - poorly designed. We&#039;re thinking of just ditching the black plastic insert.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>Enjoyable game of trying to combine your remaining pieces into a single group, analogous to [gameid=3406], but different in detail: hex grid, move in a line to any empty space, and 2 types of pieces which can explode and destroy adjacent pieces or pieces in one direction.

So far, I think self-destructing is a stronger strategy than Nestor wants it to be. But it&#039;s still fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>159</numplays>			<comment>A surprise hit for me.  I&#039;d never heard of it till [[Pionek]] September 2008, where I got roped into a 5-player game and quite enjoyed it.  Sudoku-like map, neat idea for a goal (have as few connected groups as possible), attractive bits.

2009-05-26: played 2-player for the first time, with Maks, and enjoyed it. It uses the common annoying method of having each player take 2 colors, but each turn you can freely choose which of your colors you will play, so that was neat. (Unlike, e.g., 2-player Blokus where I always get confused which of my 2 colors I&#039;m supposed to be playing...)

2009-11: finally purchased. :)</comment>				</item>

There are various ways to avoid its reputed deadlocks, e.g. start with few units on a large map, use the optional 2-point cost to build a new unit, use pre-designed scenarios findable in the web, etc.

	<numplays>146</numplays>			<comment>Tough clever tactical puzzle game. Each turn you want to figure out how to get the best set of pieces, and hopefully deprive the opponents of a good move. The jumping mechanism reminds me a little bit of Army of Frogs somehow! But the eruption mechanism is interesting and different. I suck at it, but I like it. Works fine 2-player or with more.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A pure strategy game that I wanted to like more than I did.  The rules were a little less clear than they should be for such a simple elegant game, the components were a bit clunky and odd, and setting up the fixed-design map from individual tiles at the start was mildly annoying.  Enjoyed enough to play a few times in a row just to see how it goes, but it just doesn&#039;t grab me strongly.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Sort of reminded me of Roma (roll dice and allocate them to various actions).

OK game with some strategic and tactical decisions (e.g. when to stop increasing your number of worker bees=dice and start building honey), but didn&#039;t excite either of us very much, alas. (We played 2 player short game twice and long game once.)

The queen bee cards felt like a bit too much random chaos in what is otherwise a fairly simple clean open-information design; before one knows all the cards, needing to look up card effects (and you can&#039;t just ask your opponent since card draws are secret) felt a bit bogging down (same as in Roma, coincidentally!), compared to the rest of the game which usually flowed smoothly and quickly with no real need to look up rules (although the organization of the rulesheet was odd, and we did have to resolve some questions, e.g. all examples show 1 or 2 bees of same type on a tile: is it legal to but different type bees? Is it legal to put more than 2? Seemingly yes, by rules as written, but we weren&#039;t 100% sure that was the intent. Rules about setting up the queen bee deck were unclear, especially with one card type having only 2 instead of 3 cards due to manufacturing error. Etc.)

Also it suffers from an annoying graphic design / ergonomic problem:

We&#039;re not colorblind, but 3 of the 6 nectar cube colors are WAY too similar (red, orange, pink). I see others commented on this problem in the forum, so it&#039;s not just us.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I played it back when it came out in 1977 or so, and then bought it again for nostalgia in 2009. Finally got it to the table 2010-10-25. It&#039;s got a lot of bookkeeping compared to popular modern games. And info is secret so you can&#039;t assist and check each other. This proved to be more bookkeeping than my 20-something opponent liked. Generation gap. :)

The rules are actually pretty nice and elegant and minimalist. (And explicitly lend themselves to adding new ideas and house rules, if one is so inclined.) There is no randomness except that of simultaneous decisions in combat. There is hidden information. Each ship is individually designed, but without too much bookkeeping.

Also, then and now, I am not sure whether I like the random chaos of simultaneous decisions in the combat system. But if several ships are involved, it starts to become possible to make more educated guesses and rational analysis of the battle - which was pleasing.

And the rules are unclear about the important issue of how much information you reveal to the opponent (e.g. if you fire a beam and miss, do they know what your beam strength was? Do you tell how much damage your shields ignore? Etc.)

I&#039;d enjoy playing it more. It&#039;s dated and kind of minimalist in some ways, and if I&#039;m in the mood for a minimalist space war game, I&#039;d more often prefer [gameid=14634]. (And I&#039;m curious to try the purely deterministic more recent tactical space combat game [gameid=28949].)

But I still have WarpWar nostalgia (which probably makes my rating a point higher than it might be if this were a new game, to be honest). It&#039;s a classic MicroGame certainly worth exploring for anyone who likes &quot;design spaceships and attack each other&quot; type games.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Nostalgia.</wishlistcomment></item>

The headbands are a little awkward/uncomfortable, but it&#039;s a fun clever game when you&#039;re in the mood for a deduction game.  So far I just keep track of what I directly know, but I can imagine playing it at a more serious level and using meta-information about the other players not yet guessing their numbers, and what I can infer from that, given that they are rational...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>Good combinatorial / abstract strategy game of removing pieces from a grid! Very simple elegant rules.

Like Alien City and Synapse-Ice it starts off rather opaque, as you both take 1 point each turn, but then at some point you are able to read ahead and realize &quot;aha, these are the ways it can proceed&quot; with potentially large amounts of points being taken back and forth.

The fact that your own color pieces are worth 0 to you and 2 to your opponent works well for sometimes creating neat asymmetrical situations and forced moves.

The random setup gives variety, like in TZAAR or Hey! That&#039;s My Fish!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>A clever fun but rather chaotic game (possibly too chaotic for its length). The central mechanism is: pick 5 of your 12 role cards to use in a round. Then in sequential order we reveal our cards of a given role if we have them, saying if we want to be that role (risking that a later person with the card will steal the role from us) or say &quot;so be it&quot; and use the secondary power of the card. Nifty. Attractive bits.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>81</numplays>			<comment>I like the mostly non-random nature of it.  The first few times it takes a long time, but experienced players go quickly, and 2-player (we play that way at home, though it&#039;s not as good 2-player, and most people seem to not like it at all 2-player) is often under an hour.

But gameplay is longer than I prefer with a large group, or with newbies.  And newbies can be lose terribly from a single early mistake, then suffer for a long time.  Game length and its not being as good for 2-player is the main reason I don&#039;t rate it even higher.  It&#039;s a very cool interesting game.

	<numplays>88</numplays>			<comment>Simple elegant abstract with nifty gimmick: 4 in a row wins, but exactly 3 in a row loses. Leads to amusing aha-effects as players learn strategy.

2-player games always seem to end decisively.

3-player is a fun less serious twist. So far they usually seem to end fairly soon (but not as fast as 2-player), but sometimes they enter an interesting endgame where you need to try to maximize your number of &quot;safe spaces&quot; where you can play but opponent&#039;s can. We had at least one game where one player lost (due to 3 in a row) and the others tied.

Great filler game for a con or club meeting - portable, very easy to teach, works with 2 or 3 players.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Sort of wacky 4-player variant. Diplomacy/negotiation naturally becomes significant. OK as a light silly variant, it seems, but a bit long; maybe next time we&#039;d play that the first person to mate anyone wins, instead of that the sole survivor wins. (That would also remove some ambiguities about how to handle the pieces/turn of the eliminated player.)

We found that the rules were a bit tricky and have various variants mentioned inline, so a bit of discussion beforehand seems wise to confirm everyone is on the same page.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>52</numplays>			<comment>Surprisingly subtle non-obvious strategy in this placement game of trying to have the largest visible region in your color! A combination of several clever little rules makes it interesting.

Our first 2 games we played by the wrong rules (more obvious/natural rules - entirely my fault from having read the rules months earlier and trying to remember/reconstruct them) and even that was fun. But then with the [i]real[/i] rules we were [i]really[/i] impressed!

I&#039;ve played various games of the type &quot;take turns placing a piece of your color and try to make as big a group as you can of your color&quot; and usually the groups get bigger and bigger and you can see roughly how things will progress and where the big scoring group will be. In Zaic, due to the way the cutting rules work, the ending is often not at all what you might expect, and sometimes the winning group is surprisingly small. 

The pieces look and feel great. Wish they were a little thicker to make it easier to see levels of stacks at a glance.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>155</numplays>			<comment>A very clever enjoyable induction game. Like a game version of doing science, or debugging a program. I play it with colored wooden cubes, and online here with emoticons.

The ability to play with a variety of pieces makes it easy to play in unexpected circumstances.  It&#039;s also useful to play in a foreign language to practice speaking about logical stuff in the language.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A pleasant filler card game.  Try to collect cards so that your hand has as low a value as possible, ideally 0.  Some nice clever mechanisms.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>68</numplays>			<comment>Despite having read [url=http://www.scat.demon.co.uk/zertz/strategy.htm]a good article by Stephen Tavener[/url] about tactics, specifically the use of setting up forced jumps for your opponent from which you benefit more, and getting these techniques demonstrated to me by stronger players, my brain refuses to grok it.  Nonetheless I admire it and enjoy the game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>19</numplays>			<comment>A 2-player card game with zombies advancing toward the barricaded humans, who are doing their best to stop the advancing hordes.  Lots of special effect cards showing typical actions from zombie movies.

Amusing, quick, nice art.  Polish text on the cards, but good icons remind you of what each card does.  It plays well and fast, and seems reasonably balanced.

Mechanically it&#039;s like a weird cross between Neuroshima Hex (draw up to 4 cards, discard one, play or hold the others) and Lord of the Rings: Confrontation (the fellowship of the zombies tries to get past the humans&#039; barricade at Mordor...)

The rules are a bit frustratingly unclear in places, and the English translation leaves out info from the Polish original, but most questions are eventually solvable.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Sequel to Zombiaki, a good thematic 2-player zombie card game. This new version is evolutionary, not revolutionary. The cards are larger and better quality.

We did the English translation.

I think I like the actual gameplay of the original Zombiaki more than the sequel. This one introduces some different zombies/abilities that just feel weirder to me somehow. But it does have the amusing &quot;American Shit&quot; card. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;d read this was a lame game, and it is indeed the most disappointing game I&#039;ve played in a long time.  Vague parts in the rules, ambiguous confusing map tile art (another triumph of cool art over functionality), but worst of all it has very little excitement and doesn&#039;t really capture the feel of a zombie horror film.  It&#039;s more like a tedious repetitive dice fest that drags on forever.  Your randomly rolled movement points each turn are too few, so it takes forever to move around the map.  It dragged on and on, and we eventually got too tired to continue and just went to sleep.  The game box doesn&#039;t tell how long the game takes, and I wonder if it&#039;s because they don&#039;t know because no one ever finished a game.

A hundred plastic zombies are a fun idea, but it feels like that was the core idea of the game, and the rules were just slapped together to have an excuse to sell a hundred plastic zombies in a box.

It was also annoyingly inconvenient that the life and bullet counters are printed only one one side (red life, black bullets) with indistinguishably identical white backs.  They get moved around and accidentally flipped over a lot, so they really should have been printed on both sides.
 
The 2-player card game Zombiaki is playable in less than half an hour and much better captures the feel of a zombie film.

=== 

Meanwhile the game has a bogus misleading high rating with roughly a thousand people &quot;temporarily&quot; rating it &quot;10&quot; due to [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/940650]a campaign in March 2013 to raise its rating as high as possible[/url] (and people like me who had rated it low even received direct geekmails pressuring them to change their rating).

Despite this &quot;10&quot; campaign being &quot;temporary&quot; with people supposed to restore their honest ratings soon thereafter, most of those &quot;10&quot; ratings still remain, years later.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The print-it-yourself hex pieces have murky dark photographs that are too hard to distinguish when printed in black and white.  There&#039;s some ambiguity in the rules about scoring animals.  But hey, it&#039;s the first Polish boardgame I&#039;ve played.  And the basic idea and movement system was pleasing.</comment>				</item>
