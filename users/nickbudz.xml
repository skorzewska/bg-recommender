	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>The first time I played 7 Wonders, I immediately knew it was a keeper.  It&#039;s a lot of fun to see how your little empire builds up over the course of a game, and I love how there is no down time.

I also own the Leaders expansion (highly recommended for when 7 Wonders starts to feel &quot;samey&quot;), the Wonders Pack, and the Catan Island promo.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Fun, fast, silly game.  I love the pictures of the food (my personal favorite: post modern coffee, which is just a puddle of water and a few beans), love the awesome components (recommendation: use super glue to keep the bottoms of the shakers on), and love how much everyone constantly messes up during the game.  If only I was better at flipping crepes...</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Definitely looks like nothing else I&#039;ve got in my collection, and also looks like a fun game to play with the future kids.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Not a bad game at all, but feels very overproduced compared to the gameplay.  I find myself wanting to own the game despite a very lukewarm experience with it so far, and that is pretty much completely due to the artwork and component quality.

Beautiful game, but not worth owning just to look at.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Great, great game.  You never feel like you have enough turns to get everything you need, and the tension that can build up is amazing.  Probably the best designed game I&#039;ve ever played, although not necessarily the most fun.  I highly recommend upgrading your copy with some veggie/resource/animeeples!

I also own the Gamers&#039; Deck expansion.

UPDATE: Unfortunately, it looks like Agricola has been fired from my collection by Caverna.  The tension I love in Agricola is largely absent from Caverna, which is a big plus for my wife and other members of my game group.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Fun, thematic game.  The core set is good for awhile, but after a few games you&#039;ll start picking up on cards that are kind of stinky and wishing you could streamline your strategy a bit more.  

Even if you aren&#039;t interested in expansions or building you own decks, I&#039;d definitely still say this one is worth buying.

I own 2 core sets and all of the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle.  I think my collecting days are over, however.  I only really play this game with one friend, and it&#039;s not worth the constant investment to keep up with the new releases.  I&#039;ve got enough cards to last me forever.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Really, really fun.  Create a team, equip them with gear, and go out and hit things.  Get new gear, go hit things harder.  Awesome!  The only really bad thing about the game is that it takes a while to set up, but it&#039;s no worse than Descent or any other map tile-based game.

Also own the Beyond the Grave expansion.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Barely a game, and there are times when it is barely fun.  With that being said, you really have no idea what will happen when you play this game, and are almost guaranteed to have a memorable experience when the haunt occurs.

It&#039;s like Resident Evil mixed with Scooby Doo, and I really enjoy it.  It&#039;s the type of game that I&#039;ll keep in my collection even though it rarely makes it to the table.  Just playing it once every Halloween would be enough for me!

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Awesome components (I love putting cubes in the little ships) and just a great overall game.  The variable player powers really add a lot, as they allow you to break the game&#039;s rules in some way.  It&#039;s always really fun to see what other players are unlocking, and while the game can get kind of mean when your ships start being sunk, you get them all back the very next turn.  Highly recommend this one.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>I love that this game has a &quot;take-that&quot; feel without hurting anyone&#039;s feelings.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>I hate Apples to Apples, mostly because I feel like there is no way to catch up if you fall behind.  In Cards Against Humanity this never feels like a problem, because so many of your card choices are awful and hilarious, and when you lose it&#039;s usually because someone else played something even funnier.  Fun game if you&#039;ve got the right group for it.

EDIT: Big problem with this game - playing it too much, or letting a session go for too long.  If people stop giggling at the cards, it&#039;s time to play the haiku card and move on!  Fell way down in my rankings due to overplaying, and I&#039;m not really sure I ever need to play it again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>When I play Castles of Burgundy, I can tell it&#039;s a really well-designed game, but it still feels like it&#039;s missing something (fun, perhaps).  It&#039;s really ugly-looking, and by the time I finish a game of it, I just feel...nothing.  I enjoy the gameplay well enough I guess, but I&#039;d just rather play something a little more exciting.  Really surprised that it is rated as highly as it is on BGG.</comment>				</item>

Great game, but...eh.  It just doesn&#039;t have the same magic as Agricola to me, even if it might be a better game overall.</comment>				</item>

As a result, I backed the Kickstarter version that also came with the Reformation expansion.

My verdict?  DISAPPOINTMENT.  The game is fine, but very...bland.  I&#039;d rather play Mascarade or The Resistance every time.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I love Descent as a replacement for traditional pen and paper adventures.  It&#039;s a lot easier to get right into the business of running a campaign for those of us without a lot of spare time.

I&#039;m a terrible Overlord, but that makes me a GREAT Overlord, because I am most concerned in making sure everyone is having fun, myself included.  If you just try to crush the heroes, you might end up winning, but you  might also end up with nobody to play Descent with.

I also own all of the base-game lieutenant packs, as well as the Shadow of Nerekhall, Lair of the Wyrm, Trollfens, and Manor of Ravens expansions.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Easy to learn, fast to play, and I love the hidden roles everyone has.  My favorite part of the game is definitely looking at the actions of the other players and trying to figure out what they are working towards.  Everyone tries to team up on the player who might be winning, while also trying to screw everyone else over and advance their own agendas.  As an added bonus, the artwork in the game really makes me want to read more of the Discworld books!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>I really like Dungeon Petz, but there are a ton of components and the game can feel very fiddly at times.  Despite having a ton of things going on at once, the rules always justify what is happening (and the rulebook is hilarious).  Fun game, which I think might deserve a higher rating if I can get the same group of people to play it a few times.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>I like the theme of Dungeon Lords better, but the reviews of Petz make me think I&#039;d like it more in terms of gameplay.  Some of the reviews make it seem like it&#039;s too complicated for its own good, but I like that it can be played with two players and is apparently pretty awesome once you get the rules down.</wishlistcomment></item>

I don&#039;t think we ever finish the game once we start.  We&#039;ll just play a few rounds and move on to something else.  As a result, I sold this one off.</comment>				</item>

All of this from a small box consisting of some cards, paper maps, and a few pencils.  Awesome.  The only thing keeping me from ranking it higher is that it has player elimination, which I hate.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>We are TERRIBLE at this game!!!  There is a 1 in 6 chance of rolling a black mask, which locks one of your dice up, and we roll them constantly.  It can be rather frustrating.

All the same, Escape is fast and a lot of fun.

I also own the Illusions expansion.  You can fit everything from the base game in the Illusions box with room to spare, which is awesome!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Hearing great things - sounds like a chaotically fun time.</wishlistcomment></item>

Analysis paralysis could make this game AWFUL; you have to be able to quickly find a decent move and then just make it.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>While the game is still fun, the theme has really suffered since it switched to Friday the 13th from Poison.  In Poison, the game made more sense; you were filling cauldrons with ingredients, trying not to get them to boil over, and avoiding poison.  In Friday the 13th, you are just avoiding too many ladders and black cats.  

It&#039;s a minor quibble, but the new theme just doesn&#039;t work as well, and turned me off my plans of purchasing the game.</comment>				</item>

The game is completely worth it for those moments when everyone flips over their order tokens and you find out just how much you are going to be helped/screwed.

EDIT: Fun game, but too long to get played very often. Sold my copy.</comment>				</item>

Great game, and not at all hard to pick up once you figure out the rules.  I prefer RftG for 2-player games, and GtR for everything else.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Love this game.  Thematic, great artwork, and creates memorable moments.

The first time we played, my wife raced to the top of the mountain with me close on her heels, only to get stuck at the summit during bad weather.  By the time her climber finally succumbed to the worsening conditions, my own climber, who had been waiting out the storm right below the summit, was in such bad shape he died the next turn (RIP Sherpa Bob).  Our friend, who had been waiting further down the mountain, then leisurely cruised to victory.  Great first impression for a great game.

I also own the Broad Peak expansion.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I have a blast with King of Tokyo every single time I play it.  The artwork in the game is awesome, it plays quickly, and I&#039;ve never once felt bored.  Great game.  The only knock against it is that it has player elimination, although the game usually doesn&#039;t last much longer once monsters start dying off.

I highly recommend playing with the variant found here:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/821635/thedackers-double-dose-of-energy-variant

I also own the Power Up and Halloween expansions.

EDIT: Definitely fired from my collection by King of New York.  I like that KoNY gives the players more to do if they aren&#039;t in the main point-getting parts of the city (Tokyo/Manhattan).  I&#039;ll of course keep KoT, so I can keep playing as Cyber Bunny!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>I really enjoy this one.  We often find that our families start taking on certain themes as we play (lots of craftsmen, lost of one particular nationality, etc.) due to the goals we are trying to achieve, which adds a nice little layer of storytelling to the game.  It plays a little differently than other worker placement games I own, and I&#039;m happy to have it in my collection.

Unfortunately, the game doesn&#039;t come with one of the necessary components: a huge honking table.  Also unfortunately, the cards used for currency in the game STINK.  There just aren&#039;t enough, and they get messy as the game progresses.  I use the coins from Tuscany as a replacement.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>The Dice Tower review sold me on this one.  I&#039;ve been hearing lots of good things!</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Great hidden movement game, but takes a loooooong time to play (usually over 2 hours for us), and can get pretty frustrating for the investigators if they can&#039;t find any clues.  Still, if you like this style of game, Letters from Whitechapel is a winner.

EDIT: Fired from my collection by Fury of Dracula.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>We loooooove hidden movement games like Nuns on the Run and Escape from the Aliens in Outer Space.  My wife is freaked out by Escape and Nuns on the Run works best with lots of players, so this one looks like a winner.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>19</numplays>			<comment>One of my all-time favorites.  Easy to teach and learn, plays quickly, and always has the potential for big surprises and laughs.  It has player elimination, but you&#039;re never out for that long.

The worst thing about it is that the artwork is super boring, so I ended up picking up the Kanai Factory edition with the original art (although I prefer the new version&#039;s Contessa to the original&#039;s Minister -- the Contessa adds a layer of bluffing to the game, while the Minister adds more risk).</comment>				</item>

The only real issue with the game (despite the fact that it has the UGLIEST board ever) is that it lasts a little too long.</comment>				</item>

One of the best things I can say about it is that when somebody correctly identifies the culprit, almost everyone else at the table was right on the verge of guessing it as well.  Nobody ever feels like they were completely out of the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Awesome, awesome 2 player game.  I love how simple it is, while also presenting a little puzzle to solve.

I replaced the button tokens in the game with real buttons, which makes the game more fiddly but adds a fun tactile experience.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Fun, but a little fiddly for this type of game (which is kind of par for the course as far as a Vlaada game is concerned).  Lots of little chits and cards to keep track of.  All the same, trying to draw some of the harder words is a ton of fun, and the game can be super funny.  Recommended, and I would pretty much always prefer this game to Telestrations.</comment>				</item>

The problem is, well...it&#039;s kind of bland.  I don&#039;t want to sell it, but I don&#039;t really ever play it either, which is a problem because I really feel like this one deserves more plays than I have given it so far.

I also own the Pied Piper expansion.

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Surprisingly blah.  The game can be really fun and funny, but I find that it&#039;s mostly just kind of boring.  Most of the time my group only tries to sneak contraband through once or twice a game, so the sheriff just keeps getting burned over and over again by opening bags.  If the sheriff tries to take their time questioning people, the game bogs down (EDIT: the app helps a lot with timing the sheriff, as well as helping with the tedious scoring!).

Great idea, just not as fun as I was hoping.  A hit with my group, however.

EDIT: Upgraded my rating based off some info I read here at BGG.  It basically said that as a bluffing game, Sheriff is pretty crappy.  As a NEGOTIATION game, however, it shines.  If you play to what the Sheriff is collecting (you see that he has a lot of apples, so you slip a few in your bag and offer him the choice of a card if he lets you through), the game becomes a LOT more fun and the amount of contraband trying to be brought in skyrockets, making all aspects of the game better.</comment>				</item>

I also own the X-Wing, Y-Wing, Milennium Falcon, Tie Bomber, and HWK-290 expansions.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Anyone who compares this game to SimCity is doing it a disservice.  Suburbia is fun, but the only thing it shares with SimCity is a similar theme.  The gameplay is all about finding good combos with tiles and setting yourself up for success later in the game, and while it is certainly fun, a little more player interaction (outside of blocking each other from taking tiles and the occasional bonus from someone else&#039;s suburb) would be welcome.

A solid 7.5.  Good, but not quite great.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Going by appearance alone, this game looks sooooo boring.  Everything I&#039;ve read about it, however, makes it seem incredible.  SimCity in game form?  AMAZING.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Amazing 2-player game.  I love how almost every match ends in some dramatic way.  The different factions all feel really different from one another.  I have considered selling this game and just playing on the app, but it&#039;s definitely a game worth keeping around (even though the box is huge).

I also own all the faction decks and Second Summoner decks.  This is one of the few games I will pretty much blindly buy any expansion for, with the exception of the reinforcement decks (don&#039;t really see the need to change things up with them!).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Not the Trains-killer I was hoping for, but still a really good game.  I love the art style, and the game flows well and quickly.

My biggest issue with the game is that the deck-building aspect is pretty unsatisfying.  Yes, the cards you add to your deck will make big, immediate improvements, but since the artwork on the new cards is the same as the old, it doesn&#039;t feel &quot;special&quot; when you upgrade a pilot.</comment>				</item>

Lots of fun, although watch out for those whose feelings get hurt easily.  For some reason, they will have a hard time getting over the sharks and sea monsters you direct to eat their survivors.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>This game looks soooo boring, and truth be told, it IS boring.  It&#039;s also very well-made, plays fast, and having a board is a definite improvement on the deck-building formula.

Despite being a very good game, however, I have a hard time getting past the boring board, boring card artwork, and boring theme. I&#039;m happy to have it in my collection, and I always enjoy the times I play it, but it&#039;s a hard game to get super excited about playing.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>I like Dominion a lot.  It&#039;s easy to teach, intuitive, and fast.  I have heard Trains described as an improved version of the Dominion-style deck builder, but would the added complexity make the game less accessible?</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>A lot of fun, and the mechanic of only having certain actions available during certain phases of the game helps differentiate it from other worker placements in my collection.  I find myself always wanting to play it, although it&#039;s not the most popular game with everyone in my group.  I also find myself always wanting a glass of wine while playing, and I&#039;m more of a beer guy myself.

I also own the Tuscany expansion, with its sweet sweet metal coins.  The extra modules it adds to the game will make it so you never go back to the base game again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>I can&#039;t see myself ever owning another game quite like this one.  Solving games by playing a variation of telephone sounds INCREDIBLY TERRIBLE, but it is so much fun.  There are times I have laughed so much trying to convey the facts I knew to another player that I started forgetting super important details, which just made me crack up even more.  I am not familiar with the source material, but love the artwork.  Big fan of this one.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>The best part about this game is that it&#039;s a trivia game in which you can know practically nothing about trivia and still win.  It&#039;s been a hit every single time it&#039;s made it to the table.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Love love love love love this game.

I definitely recommend implementing ALL of the rule changes found here:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/803845/why-the-new-version-seems-unfun-and-my-suggestions/page/1

The game becomes much more about running around and casting fun spells, rather than worrying about counter-spells and racing to see who gets the treasures back to their base first.

I also own the Malefic Curses and Bestial Forces expansions.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Perfect expansion.  Inexpensive, everything fits in the original game box, and adds more fun stuff to a game already loaded with fun stuff.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Love Wiz War, and can&#039;t wait to add more to the game.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>On our first play, my wife got stuck with a hand of five cards that had no match on the battlefield.  She then passed for the last half of the game while I proceeded to shoot all my own soldiers, miss hitting her soldiers, and run out of cards to draw, thus losing.

I love the theme and artwork of this game, but man, I feel like our first game could not have been more of a stinker.  It&#039;s a shame when one play makes me already think of house rules that could salvage things.</comment>				</item>
