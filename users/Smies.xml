For instance, I don&#039;t have a TV, so I don&#039;t know many of the people I have to describe. Still, probably good for a few laughs.

	<numplays>73</numplays>			<comment>7 Wonders is a surprisingly rich card drafting game. You play three hands of seven cards and each turn you pick a card from your hand and pass on the rest. The turn structure really is that simple. This way you try to build your own civilization and score the most victory points in various ways. A big part of the game is to set up a resource engine that will last your game plan through all three hands, or ages. The Wonders that give this game its name provide players with special abilities which really affect your play. 
Within the game you only interact with your direct neighbors. Mainly, the player interaction is limited to  passing cards, buying resources and comparing military strenght after each age.
7 Wonders is a highly replayable game that needs a few plays to really grow on you. The virtual resource mechanic needs some time to settle in and specific card knowledge helps a great deal to do well. I first rated it a six, but over time I kept adjusting its rating: now, it&#039;s one of my few 10 rated games. Games are quick, varied and really a lot of fun. The more I play, the more I want to play and that is probably it&#039;s best quality.

The Leaders expansion adds a great deal of strategy while not adding a lot to the complexity. It adds a smaller fourth hand, which you draft at the beginning of the game and which you keep for the entire game. At the start of each age you get to play one of these leader cards. Basically you plot out your strategy at the beginning of the game based on the leaders you&#039;re dealt and draft. Hate drafting now happens less often, but is more meaningful. Also, money becomes more important since leaders have to be paid with money. This is a great improvement from the base game, where money was only used for buying resources.

I&#039;d say the Leaders expansion is a must have expansion, whereas the Cities expansion is a very good expansion, but not a mst-have per se. Instead of three hands of seven cards, you now play three hands of eight. The extra cards are a new type of cards which add some more direct player interaction. The new cards shake up your decision tree quite nicely.

The Wonder Pack is another must have expansion, as you can never have enough wonders for extra replayability. Also, these new wonders are awesome and some of the most fun ones to play with.

	<numplays>31</numplays>			<comment>A great game with constant pressure, both from the game design itself with a plethora of scoring criteria, and from the other players. I particularly like you have to immediatly perform the chosen action, instead of after all placements have been made like most other worker placement games. You are very limited in your number of actions and there really is a lot to do. There are a ton of different resources and a lot of planning is involved when managing these resources and actions. The hand management keeps this game replayable. Everybody basically needs the exact same things; the cards make sure everybody takes a different route to get to meet the scoring criteria.
It&#039;s a very complete game, with a family and an advanced game. Also, there are three different decks of cards making sure this game is even more replayable.
It&#039;s not all perfect though, set up and take down takes quite a while and the game lacks a proper storage tray. I had to buy some plastic boxes myself.
I&#039;ve only played this as a 2-player game. I would love to play with more players, even if it just introduces some new occupations for 3+ games.

I&#039;ve pimped my game with the wooden building resources and the wooden vegetables and grain resources from Lookout Games and the wooden food tokens from Boardgame Extras.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting, mean quasi-cooperative game. Players attempt to escape the infamous Alcatraz prison and in order to do this all six steps have of the escape plan have to be executed. Only the players who can&#039;t be missed for the execution will win the game and successfully escape. All others are left behind. The designers have stated they wanted a game driven by negative emotions and with that they have succeeded I guess, although our first game was still a bit mechanical as we were still learning the rules. Still, there was some evil meta-gaming going on. But, more plays will see if it can truly live up to our expectations of such a game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Wonderful game with different kinds of set collection. You have to collect sets of different buildings to score victory points. In order to buy these buildings you have to collect sets of different currency. There&#039;s also a great tile placement mechanic. The buildings have to be placed in your Alhambra. Some buildings have walls, which score you extra victory points, but can limit your future expansion as well.
I like getting an extra turn by paying exact cash.
It&#039;s best with 3-4 players and usually doesn&#039;t last much longer than an hour, and that&#039;s an hour well spent,

I don&#039;t own this game and I&#039;m quite interested in Granada, which adds a few more interesting aspects. The tiles are two-sided and can be flipped by paying for it. Last but not least: scoring is variable, based on the amount of buildings there are of that colour in each players Alhambra, instead of a fixed number per scoring round.</comment>				</item>

A lot of rules but very little game. It&#039;s probably thematic, but I played with the wrong group of people. It&#039;s not at all a fault of the game, the artwork and production value are amazing.

I do want to try it again, though. Two of my friends are very enthusiastic about this game. Maybe I&#039;ve just not discovered it&#039;s pure brilliance yet...

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Upfront I&#039;ll state that this is my least favorite game of the Big Box games I&#039;ve tried by Uwe Rosenberg, but by no means is it a bad game. For me, a 6 is still above average (although not by much) and I&#039;ll play the game from time to time. 
Like other Uwe Rosenberg games this is a resource management and optimization game, but more so than the others this is a logistical puzzle. You have to manage up to 9 fields where you can harvest up to 6 different types of vegetables, ultimately to satisfy both your regular and your incidental customers. Sell your vegetables with the most profit to buy the most victory points and win the game.
Unlike Agricola there is no worker placement mechanic and unlike Le Havre and Ora et Labora there is no common pool of buildings to buy and use. Because of this, this game lacks most of the indirect interaction the other games have to offer. The player interaction comes in the form of a card drafting round at the start of each turn and cards come in 5 varieties: extra fields, regular customers, incidental costumers, markets (to trade vegetables) and helpers for all kinds of benefits.
My two biggest gripes with the game are not being able to plan your actions more than the current turn which doesn&#039;t relly fit well with a resource management logistical puzzle in my opinion. The second gripe is that in a game lacking most player interaction, some of the helper cards that do let players interact are pretty harmful. As it is, I&#039;d prefer the game to be a strictly multiplayer solitaire engine game. That&#039;s probably better than a game where I can&#039;t interact with you, but you can interact with me because you drew the right cards. As a result of both these gripes and the fact that players can do a lot of stuff on their turn downtime is an issue, even more so as you can&#039;t really plan ahead during other players turns.
Also, I&#039;ve never played with more than two players, but there are some very clunky three and four player rules.

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;ve played the first five scenarios from both sides. We&#039;ve just been introduced to Lore in the last scenario we played and it&#039;s great. It changes the dynamics quite a bit. I can&#039;t wait to form my own war council and diversify in Lore powers!
The next scenario introduces the giant spider and the special races combined with Lore. I can&#039;t wait to play again.
Battles of Westeros is the better medieval tactical wargame, but I still want to play some more fantasy scenario&#039;s though, especially the Dragons, Creatures and Heroes expansions!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I really like BattleLore, but it has to be even better in the A Song of Ice and Fire setting!
My first few plays have not let me down. The commanders truly are an improvement over the left-centre-right gameplay of Battlelore. The 8-sided die with different probability for different ranks has changed the game a lot for the better, as well. I also like the scenario specific victory conditions.

Traded it for Twilight Struggle.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>I don&#039;t like negotiation games, but I do have to make an exception for this one. This is a brilliantly frustrating card game. You&#039;re dealt a hand full of different bean cards and you&#039;re trying to collect sets of them. You only start out with two fields, meaning you can only start selecting sets of two kinds of beans. The game revolves around that players are not allowed to arrange their hand, the cards have to be played the order they&#039;re dealt. This makes it really hard to harvest a large set of the same kind of beans, since your hand is clogged with all kinds of beans. Players have to make deals to get rid of cards not in their favour. Somehow, the way you&#039;re basically forced to negotiate works for me. Another great mechanic is that when harvesting beans, cards are turned over and become money. This way the amount of beans gets lower as well, making it harder to get large sets in the future.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>The game that got me back into boardgaming! I played this so many times and I enjoyed every single one of them. I no longer play it as often as I used to, as my gaming tastes moved on to heavier games, but this is still a lot of fun when I do. I love seeing the board grow differently every time. I love how you can play this more or less agressive.
Nowadays I&#039;d rather play with just the base game and the Inns &amp; Cathedrals expansion. Over time I collected quite a number of expansions, but it quickly gets bloated to a point where t&#039;s no longer a quick, lighter type game.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Interesting Carcassonne variant. It takes some time to get used to the fact that only roads have to match, but then you&#039;ll find a really good game. Whereas regular Carcassonne starts small and grows outwards and always bigger and bigger - giving more and more options to place your tiles - this game grows inwards - giving less options as the game progresses.
Also, the scoring tiles on the track are a great incentive to build both small and large buildings/roads/et cetera.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>Carson City stands out from the majority of worker placement games, as it&#039;s one of the few without yet another resource management mechanic (of which I personally grew a bit tired after Agricola, Caylus, Stone Age et cetera). Instead, this game has a strong spatial element and introduces direct conflict. Players are building the town of Carson City and contest for the best parcels and the best buildings. A role selection mechanic gives players certain benefits, opening a ton of different strategies. The worker placement mechanic feels fresh, since it adds a new kind of turn angst. Because more than one player can select the same action a duel has to be fought to decide who can perform said action. There are ways to migigate this, but this will cost you extra -valueable- actions. The variant where duels are fought with the blind bidding tiles is highly recommended for a more strategic experience.
Carson City is a game with many layered subleties, like the dual turn order mechanics and the cash limits associated with each role. Since the game lasts only four rounds and actions are really scarce, each decision is impotant and meaningful. These two factors make Carson City a very strategic game.

Gold &amp; Guns is a great expansion as it adds more roles, and you now play the game with a random mix of 7 roles. This adds a lot of replayability and strategic depth as new scoring paths open up and change every game.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s not a bad game. It&#039;s just that the replayabily is lacking. After five games, my desire to play again is very low. It does have some great mechanics: the variablity in paying resources is a great feature. But the game as a whole is just too samey after multiple plays.

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>One of the most intense worker placement games I&#039;ve played. The provost adds a nice mean streak to the game, as a costly option to deny players to perform their chosen actions. These actions have to be bought and money is very tight in this game, making it extra frustrating when your actions are cancelled. When players pass the cost of these actions increases and this is another way to screw with the plans of other players. But, players already have a lot to handle: they have to gather a lot of different resources and money to be able to buy these actions and help build the castle. Turn angst is very tense in this game and there is a wonderful turn order mechanic.
A game of Caylus is a great experience. It&#039;s constant pressure and demanding gameplay is both wonderful and exhausting. This alone makes it a great game. I also like the very colourful components.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Chicago Express is a great example of a great game where complexity comes from the deep gameplay and not from overly complex rules. The ruleset is very small, but the gameplay surely packs a punch; and on top of that it plays in about an hour! It&#039;s an auction game with a shareholders mechanic and a route building aspect as well.
Production values are great and the gameplay is a lot of fun, too.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I was underwhelmed by my first play, perhaps because it may not be the best 2-player game.
I haven&#039;t got it to the table, since. I don&#039;t know exactly why not. Perhaps that&#039;s what happens when you have a lot of games and a first underwhelming experience.

A gift from my parents.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Only play this with the full compliment of 5 players.
I would love to play this game more, but I don&#039;t get to play with 5 players a lot. If I do, I would always suggest playing Cyclades.
The simultanous auction is the heart of the game, where players try to get the favor of one of the greek gods. With this favor they try to build metropolises and crush each others armies and fleets.
Turn order is a huge aspect of the auction as well, since there is limited availability of some powerful mythological creatures which can completely throw the game.

It&#039;s an area control game, where players build borders in their favour and protect their lands with knights. When you&#039;re stronger than your neighbour you can steal his land. But, these knights can be bribed and a truce can be made between two neighbouring lands, rendering your knights worthless.
The game also features a nice hand management mechanic. Cards can be played to perform actions, but they&#039;ll have to be paid for and money is tight. Therefore cards can also be sold, as a way to get more money. Players have to be careful which cards they sell, because it might be a card one of your opponents is waiting for. Turns are really simple: play/sell a card and draw a new card, either from the deck or from the pool of sold cards. Victory points are given for the lands players control and scores will go back-and-forth as players are stealing each others land.
Great game with direct conflict and a euro-game feel.

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Dominant Species is a fantastic worker placement and area control game. The area control aspect consists of two layers: the first layer is just a numerical majority and will score you some VP&#039;s. The second layer consists of dominance: the species who is best adapted to a certain area is dominant and doesn&#039;t score VP&#039;s but gets to pick a card with mostly very strong effects that affect the board state. A great aspect of the game is that scoring an area costs an action: you might score an area where you&#039;re both dominant and have the majority but that will not always be the case. The worker placement aspect consists of about twelve different actions that affect the board state: as all placements are made before any actions resolve there is a lot of ambiguity about what the board state will be when you get to resolve your actions. This gives the game a very thematic feel of adaptability and flexibility. This is often perceived as chaotic, but I think that&#039;s overstated; there is definitely room for planning. Although, someone with AP and who has to be in control, will have a really bad time as the gameplay isn&#039;t really suited to their play style.
The game can be very cutthroath, there is an abundunce of both indirect and direct interaction. Especially the card effects can be brutal, to a point where some players are no longer in contention, although there is no player elimination.
The rulebook is one of the best I&#039;ve ever come across. While not the most rules-heavy game, it&#039;s certainly a deep game with a lot of moving parts. The rules are very clear and consise which is quite the feat. A single read-through was enough to get started and we barely had to reference them whilst playing.
The components are wonderful and truly functional. I think it&#039;s great how the information that the game board has to convey is always clear, no matter how complex the board state. The 3rd edition might look a bit better, but I think will not be as clear whilst playing.</comment>				</item>

All the shuffling isn&#039;t worth playing the game, which consists of deciding what cards you want in your deck at the start of the game and then just going through the motions.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Eclipse is the real deal! I was initially intruiged because of its meteoic rise, but I must say, deservedly so!
It has all the best elements of an Ameritrash: the drama, the narrative but combines it with the best elements of a Euro: a clean rule set, victory point based scoring.
Players research technologies, with which they can customize their space ships, with which they explore the galaxy and battle to be the most dominant alien civilization. Meanwhile you have to successfully manage three resouces: money, science and materials.
As a mostly Euro player, my biggest gripe with those overproduced Fantasy Flight Games is their unwieldy ruleset. Yes, there are a lot of exceptions which make thematic sense, but for me, those get in the way of the gameplay. Eclipse has none of that, but still delivers on drama and narrative. 
A big part of the credit has got to go to the graphic design. All the iconography is clear and consise, without need to constantly reference the rulebook. Also, the game does a great job in functionally conveying a complex board state, without compromising on thematic presentation.</comment>				</item>

I would like to play again with the portraits and the extra colours expansions.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Simultaneous action selection and resource management  coupled with a funny turn-order mechanic and a nice theme. 
As most Queen games it looks fantastic, which is a part of the general appeal to play, for me!</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>Nice, quick card game. Lovely theme, beheading royalty during the French revolution. But, more importantly, it plays really well. In a turn you try to manipulate the line of victims, to score the most points yourself and maybe give your opponents some negative points in the process. A bit similar to Sitting Ducks, manipulating the order of a line of cards, but that game is way more agressive since it involves player elimination and lends itself for negotiation, bribing and backstabbing. I can easily see owning both, as they are both great fillers. This is the game to play with 2-3 players. With more I&#039;d rather play Sitting Ducks instead.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>23</numplays>			<comment>Le Havre is easily my favorite Uwe Rosenberg game. It&#039;s a resource management game with no less than 16 resources to manage. Resources can be used to build buildings, as food, as energy or to be sold for money.
Le Havre biggest strenght is it&#039;s simple turn structure: either take some resources or use a building. Downtime is kept to an absolute minimum in this game, which is remarkable as it&#039;s a very deep game.
Interaction is indirect where you can take stuff another player needs or keep blocking a building to mess up someone&#039;s timing.
Like Agricola, there is a need to feed your crew but with Le Havre it&#039;s not as restricted. It doesn&#039;t warp your gameplay decisions too much. Sure, you have to pay attention to it, but you can still mainly focus on your big plan.
Another great feature is that it offers a short and a long game and for the first time the short game feels challenging in it&#039;s own right. Of course, I prefer the long game where there are more building interactions in play, but the short game doesn&#039;t feel stripped down at all. It is a good way to learn the game or to play when you don&#039;t have time or energy to play the long game.
Be warned, the game is very fiddly and you have to come up with a storage solution. The game wants you to put all resources on the board which makes it a giant mess. I use a big plano box instead.
The game feels very thematic and all the resource conversions make sense. Especially in the long game the interactions get a lot of fun. Yes, I&#039;d like to sell sandwiches with smoked fish or build furniture with wood and leather. All of a sudden the tier 2 resources can become a viable strategy.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Hellas stands out from the Kosmos 2-player games as it is not a simple card game, but a very tactical tile-laying area control game with some direct conflict. Gameplay is a careful balancing act of exploring, defense and offense. Gods cards add some randomness in the mix, giving benefits like extra turns or extra actions. The artwork and bits are really nice, as well.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>16</numplays>			<comment>This dice game has a great premise. You get to take the risks, the previous player did not dare to take. You either win big, or lose everything. This is a really fun feature. It also makes me not care about every other player, except the one to my right. This game has no screw you element like Pickomino and Sushizock im Gockelwok and therefore I rate it lower.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>It is a nice enough game, but after repeated plays my interest is fading. It&#039;s too dependent on the card draw. Game play is oppurtunistic instead of tactical. Getting an extra stall early makes the game very unbalanced. I still like to play this game, but I would almost always suggest something else.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Nice variant of Lost Cities. It plays more people, you can decide whether you add cards upwards or downwards and there are other incentives than the betting cards of Lost Cities. So there are similarities, but it is a different game. Then again it requires the same thought process. I like both and can&#039;t imagine someone liking one but not the other.

London is the tableau building card game I was looking for. I had tried both San Juan and Race for the Galaxy before, but neither really clicked with me. London focuses more on hand management than card combinations, which impacts the luck-of-the-draw factor a lot. Also, the card deck is more or less structured so there is a sense of development and it offers some strategic play as well. Both the variable poverty scoring and the card tableau are great indirect forms of player interaction.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>203</numplays>			<comment>Simply the best game I&#039;ve ever played!
It&#039;s highly strategic since you&#039;re the one who decides which cards will be in your deck. Still very tactical, how to play these cards is very important as well.
There is still luck of the draw, but this counts for both players. With the amount of work that goes into building your deck, you&#039;re probably playing with this deck more than a few times and luck will even out a bit over the course of multiple plays.
It&#039;s also very balanced. There are 5 colors that play very different and these can be combined too, but still there is no colour stronger than the other.
It&#039;s got a high sense of achievement when a deck does exactly what you intended it to do. This game gave me some of the most satisfying wins. And losses, too. A mark of a great game! 
This game creates lasting memories; like the times I won a game with just three Goldenglow Moths or when I had over 380 zombies in play or when William had a life total of 272 playing his Vampire deck but still lost to my Felidar Souvereign. Most recently I lost a game when my opponent trampled me for a total of 1294 damage!
Card combinations are truly endless. By now, I&#039;ve gog about twelve totally different playing decks, which is more variety than I need. I don&#039;t get to play each deck as much as I want to! Still, there&#039;s always the itch to keep working on each deck or even try and build something new from scratch.
I started around Zendikar block and Innistrad block is the first block I really invested in. Both the theme, feel and mechanics of both sets are much to my liking. Return to Ravnica is another hit, even while I wasn&#039;t around for the original Ravnica. The guilds truly are a wonderful accomplishment.

Green, Black and White are favorite colors. Red is alright and I don&#039;t really care for blue, but I&#039;m starting to warm up to its play style, playing around with counter spells. Creatures are a better fit with my play style so I do like copy effects and stealing stuff. 
I&#039;m a big fan of creature combat and favor an agressive playstyle over a more controlling approach. Isn&#039;t it fantastic how you can tailor the way you want to play?!
Seeing how much time I spend building decks, reading articles about it and actually playing the game: Magic: the Gathering ia absolutely, without a doubt in my mind, the best game ever!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m still a bit lukewarm towards this game, though the second time I played it, it was better. It&#039;s an auction/gambling game. You bid to be the one who gets to buy extra shares and decides what goods will be shipped. Try to make sure that goods you have shares in make it to the harbour because your shares will rise in value. You can gamble how many boats will and will not make it to the harbour. Or take a risk and become a pirate and get all...or nothing at all.
It&#039;s fun playing, but I don&#039;t feel satisfied when the game ends. It&#039;s too random. The best player is not necessarily the winner. Most likely it&#039;s the last player who seized a ship as a pirate. This gets you a lot of money, unbalancing the auction and the rest of the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>25</numplays>			<comment>Metropolys revolves around a spatial auction and is in fact quite abstract. I&#039;m not a fan of abstract games and auctions are often not my cup of tea. Metropolys is the exception to both rules.
While abstract at its core, the goals and structure do feel very Euro-like, which is probably why I like it. There is pattern recognition but it gets combined with valuation, bluffing and hidden scoring mechanisms.
Gameplay is tense and full of moments of clever gameplay. I especially like how you can put pressure on your opponent by having them make the difficult decisions.
A great game, highly recommended, in spite of the horrible and non-functional artwork.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>25</numplays>			<comment>This co-op - a genre I really wanted to like - fixed all the problems I have with Lord of the Rings, like linearity and the playing time. I like how every game feels differently because of the randomly chosen roles and the way the diseases spread around.
I really feel I have to win. a) I want to save the world. b) I don&#039;t want to be beaten by some cardboard and wooden bits...
Still, after over 20 plays its appeal was fading quite a bit. The expansion solves this, by adding different variants, which increase difficulty not just by adding more epidemic cards to the deck.

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>This is a wonderfully easy game to learn and a hard game to master. Each and every mechanic is subtly tied into all other mechanics. Playing with the turn order and the many ways to stall each others plans is what makes this game stand out for me.
There is still a lot to learn with just the base game and there are already a lot of expansion maps I can&#039;t wait to play, each with their own rule twists. I&#039;m especially interested in the Benelux map, of course because I&#039;m Dutch but also because it&#039;s supposed to shorten the game a fair bit, which would make it get to the table more often!
Brilliant game. Each and every session has been very exciting, so far. Twice it came down on the tie breaker of having the most money.

Owned expansions; Benelux/Central Europa map, Russia/Japan map, New Power Plant deck, Promo card set</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>The Resistance takes the traitor mechanic found in other games, but strips it to its core. What&#039;s left is a great 30-minute blast filled with player interaction and actual deduction. It drops the convoluted relusets and player elimination. It&#039;s portable, which is perfect for this kind of party game. The production values are top notch.
The included, optional expansion is the way to play, though. The added plot cards were our main source of information and deduction in the games I&#039;ve played so far.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>This seems a very cool bluffing/deduction game, with more informed decisions than Werewolf in a short time-frame.
Starting at 5 players it&#039;s probably a little bit easier to get to the table as well.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>Steam is a cut-throat network building game, where players vie to make the best deliveries to make the most profit. The graphical representation is top-notch as cities come in four colours and deliveries are made by taking coloured cubes to a city of the same colour. The length of the route used for a delivery determines how much that delivery is worth in either income or victory points. Take too little income and you might end up bankrupt; take too much income and you can no longer win the game. A turn order mechanism lets players take additional actions, like creating new cities, replenishing the board with extra deliveries, upgrading the range within they can make deliveries etc.

I&#039;ve played both the basic and the standard game, the latter is my favorite. I don&#039;t care much for the turn order auction, but the added upkeep cost for locomotives and the restiction for loans are both great. Both planning and flexibilty become even more crucial.

	<numplays>35</numplays>			<comment>The game looks absolutely fantastic and feels very intuitive. The rules can be explained in just a few minutes, while not lacking any depth. There is lots of (indirect) interaction. Very tactical. And last but not least, everybody - except me - has the chance to win, until the endscore. I always lose.
The production value is amazing!

Owned expansions: The new huts: I really like these new huts, and how they add even more choices. Some huts, especially the ones that give away an extra meeple and food, are always hard fought.</comment>				</item>

Players vie for control over four different groups of immigrants who want to settle in 19th century New York Cith: the Irish, German, English and Italian. Basically, the political favors of these four groups are the four &#039;currencies&#039; players can use to bid. You gain political favors by getting these immigrants into one of the 15 districts. This way, you also have control over which &#039;currency&#039; can be used in each of the 15 battles for control, as you can only bid with political favors of a group who is present in that area.
The game also features a fantastic role selection mechanic, but unlike other games you don&#039;t get to select these roles yourself. The player who won the most battles gets elected mayor and gets to appoint these roles to the other players. The mayor scores a lot of victory points, but you also get a big sign on your back. Unfortunately, the roles you get to hand out as the mayor can come in handy to keep you in check.
Our first play was really tense, a true nailbiter. Where to bid, when to bid, how much to bid. A great game, which even exceeded the already high expectations.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Fantastic game centered around variable player powers. There are 14 races to play, and each race must be played to make the most of their strenghts and weaknesses, making this a very srategic game. This is probably the most fun part of the game, figuring out how each race plays out and interacts with others.
This is a game that rewards planning almost the entirety of the game in advance. Player interaction is completely indirect. The full game highlights this as races will be drafted according the starting set-up. As such, the game is quite AP-prone.
Nevertheless, togethe with Tzolk&#039;in, this is the Essen game of 2012!

Played as the Nomads, Chaos Magicians, Witches and Alchemists.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>143</numplays>			<comment>Truly a great game! Played well over a 100 times on the Europe map alone (probably around 200 plays for the series as a whole) and still a regualar and welcome game to my gaming table.
It&#039;s a racing game disguised as a set collecting and route building game. The ending is always nailbiting. Quite a feat for a game played over a 100 times! Will I finish all my destination tickets in time? Damn, I need just one more yellow card! Oh no, these tickets I drew are no good! Can I make a detour? 
It&#039;s a lighter, family style game, with a luck element in drawing tickets and the coloured cards. Still, timing your moves and positioning yourself on the board well wins you the game more often than not.
As a houserule, we don&#039;t use the stations and we mix in the long routes with the regular ones: the different coloured backs offer more information when drawing tickets and there happers to be a long route on top, but the risk is also greater. Trying to link three long routes and succeeding is the best way to win!

Besides being a great game, as it really is a lot of fun to play, it&#039;s also the best gateway game. Period.

The passengers add a great deal of strategy, which is good. There are also some flaws: the tickets deck is not as well laid out and it&#039;s way more fiddly, compared to Europe.

	<numplays>32</numplays>			<comment>Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries offers an unforgiving map for two/three players. Wildcards are no longer restricted, but they can only be used on ferries and tunnels. Both ferries and tunnels are abundant so there is still a lot of tension, even without the restictions. Also, there are a lot of critical one train routes, so expect a lot of blocking. The ticket distribution allows for some difficult choices.
Ticket to Ride: Europe will always be my favorite of the lot, but Nordic Countries is definitely the second best map out there.

It plays really good, as well. It&#039;s one of the heavier and longer games in my collection and a good choice when I have some hours to spare. Just one slightly annoying remark: Who came up with the red and orange player coulors? Why not four well distinct colours? </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>A great puzzle-like tile laying game. I love that there are lots and lots of ways to score victory points, this makes for a game where you have to pay attention to a lot of different aspects. This is the biggest set-back as well: it&#039;s not the easiest game to teach and the first few plays you&#039;re a bit lost. After the initial bump, though, this is a great tactical game in a very short time frame. A favorite as a 2-player game!
I finally tried the advanced rules, which reallu added more and more layers to an already very layered scoring. Money gets even tighter and there&#039;s more room for specialization. The fact a tile is needed for the effective use of your boatsmen, makes efficient tile-laying an absolute must.

Traded it for Granada.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>This looks like a nice medium weight game with a rondel and tile laying mechanics. </wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>I love the way the dice are used in this game. Throughout the entire game interesting decisions have to be made. A lot of viable strategies make up for interesting play. On top of that, I really like the artwork and playing time.
My only real concerns are that the caravan part of the game feels truly pasted on and the overseer -who we deemed would be the source of a lot of nasty interaction- just doesn&#039;t work that way.</comment>				</item>
