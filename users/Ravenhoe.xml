	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This definitely takes more plays to get your head around, the rules are not that complex, despite a few special rules when it comes to intriciate details such as the canditates location etc., but the strategy, especially long-term is where the crux lies in this game. Knowing where to invest your campaign points and in the media etc. and accepting defeat in some states while going for a surprise attack in another is what makes this game interesting. I know it is based on the actual election mechanism but the fact that some states are worth ten times the votes than others feels really weird. HX</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Again, I like the basic premise of the game and the (attempted) mixture of Carcassonne and run-of-the-mill Euro/Economic game. But why give each player his &#039;own&#039; little country to develop instead of maximizing interaction by (as in Carcassonne) have players build and compete in the same country, helping each other involuntarily, profiting of each other, collaborating in times of need etc., make it less solitaire. The artwork is average but it very well balanced and polished. So, above average Euro which could have been better.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>As a sherlockian, I do enjoy this game for its theme and appeal. The &quot;case&quot; system is nice and makes this game quite replayable (until you solved the cases that is) and works better than Cluedo which relies on the randomizer. The game mechanics are as good as non-existens. You have to roll the dice and walk around the board. There are not a lot of other elements in the game, so what i comes down to is reading clues and solving the case. It can be a bit tedious, because there is only one die, and sometimes a few rounds consist of people rolling for the dice and nothing happens. Some of the clues are a bit difficult for younger people or non-English citizens as they refer to Literature, History, Poetry etc. I found that a bit frustrating, because should you not happen to know the answer, you have no chance of solving the case by means of deduction and logic.

Other than that, a fun game and my girlfriend enjoys it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>30</numplays>			<comment>A nice variant of efficiency engine games with a bit more possible interaction due to trading, military and victory points based on opponents&#039; buildings. I especially like the mechanic of choosing one card from your hand and passing on the remaining cards. It plays very quick and I the only thing that is left for me to find out is whether it plays well with 2 players.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Definitely changes the scope and feel of the original 7 Wonders, if only because the game becomes less random and more reliant on a pre-planned (as in leader choice) strategy. It might repel the family and casual gamers but add some needed depth for strategist. I do like it a lot. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An neat little card with lovely graphics, if you like fish that is. I felt that there is not much strategy too it and almost the whole game depends on card draws, with some level of deciding when to hold back some cards etc. It is definitely not a card game that is as ingenious as others I have played but still fairly enjoyable. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>My dad and his friends play this regulary and I have been playing it with them for quiet some time. It is a very abstract game and I am very much a fan of heavily themed games. The game mechanics are simple but work well. The fact that other people see what &quot;stocks&quot; you buy is the crux of the game, because it is around the stock buying the bluffing and speculation evolves. Think Scrabble with waging. I do prefer the older editions over the new ones. My Dad has the 3M Bookshelf edition and the packaging is fantastic.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Fantastic theme. Although I am sure when this is getting republished (if !) then the theme will probably be changed into something more family friendly. There are many paths to victory and the game is very intuitively designed despite its complexity which is a sign of a great game design.

EDIT: Played it twice now and I do have a sneak suspicion that there might be a bit of a runaway leader problem here. Maybe it were only my plays that turned out that way but I will have to look out for that.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Considering that you are playing in a time of exploration, this game is very linear and dry. I do like the basic flow of the game and the various characters and abilities make for simple, yet nice tactical decisions, but why not make the &#039;new world&#039; more random, luck-based and exciting, sort of mix up the dry Euromechanics with some real discovering. The designers went for the save route but for the sake of more excitement in my opinion. For a Eurogame, this has amazing pieces and that definitely notched up the rating a little bit. 

EDIT: After a few plays, I think the game is not flexible enough despite random buildings and goods, the game plays very similar each time, especially with experienced players who decide on one strategy and keep going for it for the whole game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I have played this only once and with the Ireland expansion, so my insight into Age of Steam is rather limited. I do like the game however. It is a solid game. I must say I would have preferred more theme and artwork, I am not a Eurogamer after all. Furthermore, the leading player has an advantate due to the accumulative success. Once in the lead stays in the lead. We played a three player game and one player was doomed from the 4th turn whence he could not recover, as he was tied up in cost and could not build etc. There should have been some sort of houserule which helps the last player back to his feet (the last player cannot &quot;lose&quot; income&quot; or so). A nice game which is a tad to dry for my taste, but I am happy to play it again.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I am not a big fan, in fact I do not like &quot;efficiency engine&quot; games. Slowly build up a proficient farm and so forth is just not my cup of tea. I prefer limited options (not due the lack of family counters but lack of options in general) and more luck, luck, luck. Random events, dice, and so forth. Without random elements, it is not a game, it is a puzzle, a calculation exercise, pure stress, no fun. If I want to do something that requires a lot of energy and results in something very efficient, I go to work or take a math exam. So, Agricola is not my type of game. No surprise there, seeing that I do not like Dungeon Lords, Dominion and RFTG for the same reason. I have not played with the interactive deck, so I cannot comment on that but Agricola felt like a multi-solitaire game to me, everybody is building his own little farm and there is some interaction (choice of action) but that is it. Not my cuppa.HX</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A very &#039;simple&#039; but not uninteresting game tile / card collection. There is not as much interaction as I would prefer and it is pretty much up to each individual player to make his fortune in this game with the actions of the other players&#039; only indirectly influence your own. It is still nice to see when your opponents gnarl their teeth when you snatch away the card or tile away from them but I would not say that this game is very interactive or competitive in the sense of being confrontational. But it makes it the better family game where everyone can peacefully build and tend to his own city, keeping an eye out for what the others are doing without engaging in any sort of all-out bidding wars. 

EDIT: Does not scale with more players at all. We played a six-player game and it fell really flat.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Very light and random filler game. You can play it safe, but it sure is less fun.

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>One of Kmizia&#039;s heavier games (a la Tigris &amp; Euphrates) and once again, the theme is some random ancient civilization. In this case, it works very well because you are building pyramids and the game even plays in two epochs, the old and new kingdom, Egypt here we come ! The game can be very brainburning, especially for first-timers (like I was) because the scoring only takes place in 2 out of 6 rounds and as such, your actions and strategies build up to those phases instead of going for the quick points all the time. I love the auction mechanic that this game uses (the same as in 20th Century). There could be a tad more interaction in later phases, but what the heck, great stuff.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>You get what you expect in this game. A light theme, quite playful and big plastic pieces which make it look more than a kids&#039; game than it actually is. There is some luck in the game, which can be countered by a good strategy but some people might not like the amount of luck here. The game is pretty much all about having two actions when you need three. I like it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>My favourite Boardgame. I have been playing it solitaire mostly and with others a few times. The theme is amazing (Lovecraft Ho!) and the game mechanics too. There is a lot of random stuff going on, which ties in nicely with the chaotic theme of the Cthulhu mythos, although I know a lot of Eurogamers who would not enjoy this. The expansion packs turn this into a huge game and it can easily compete with Descent in terms of scope. Only drawback, if you play with more than four players it gets a bit too long and confusing. Also, if you are not in the right mood, play with the wrong people or in the wrong place, all the &quot;flavour&quot; of the game might not come through. 

EDIT: I have played this twice with groups who did not enjoy it or found the experience boring, and it dragged my experience and joy down with it and I have to say, this game is a definite 10 for me IN THEORY. When played with the wrong group, this can be one of the worst games ever. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I had a bad feeling about this from the moment I laid eyes on it. Dexterity and Space 4X ? Sadly, I was right, at least in my opinion. The marriage between flicking and building a space empire does not work and the two mechanics don&#039;t create the promised hybrid. I feel that the core game, apart from the flicking is really not that interesting a quite stagnant and dry. The flicking itself is kept at bay when it comes to the welcome insanity of outrageous attempts because usually, you will just go from planet to planet and flick very cautiously. But what the hell is the flicking about if not for shooting your stuff all over the place ? Also, the game takes too long, we played this for almost three hours and did not finish it, mostly because we ran out of time, but I also ran out of fun to be honest. The problem is that this game might be a novelty mix but it is neither a good dexterity game nor a good Euro game and I would rather play a better dexterity game or a better Euro game than attempting to squeeze it all into on play. This game could have been a winner, if only the playing were shorter. The board does not sit flat either, which is real shame, considering you need to flick your way through space. Disappointing. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Boy, was I surprised when I played this the first time. It looks ugly as a troll baby but the game hidden in this gem is delightful, very simple but lots of tactical subtleties and also backstabbing, a bit of randomness and reading your opponent like a book, that is, you should at least try. The artwork on the tiles is much better than the artwork on the box which is horrid, I do not know what went wrong there. The cards are a bit smallish and not nice to handle but it is a transportable 2-player game after all, so I can see why they went for that. A great 2-player game with a nice pace and which also becomes increasingly more complex as you play, due to the scarcity of survivors and the resulting vulnerability of each player.

A very good 2-player game ! </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I never liked DVD games, because the reason I play boardgame is because they are no DVDs or Computers involved. The game is pretty much catered for Children, goofy videos and colourful pieces. The basic game evolves around simple waging and dice rolling. The artwork is not very good. The novelty of the DVD quickly wears of and keep interrupting the play of the game. I do not like the game and would not recommend it.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Bought this game new from Woolworths. All parts are complete and in excellent condition, except for one &#039;coin&#039; which I replaced with an other one.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>To me, Attika is another good example of throwing lots and lots of mechanics into one big pile and making a game out of it that might work in terms of mechanics but is not more than the sum of its parts and I fail to see the overarching concept and ingenious &#039;designer&#039;s handwriting&#039; behind the run-of-the-mill euro mechanics. The basic idea is not bad and almost sounds like a simplified checkers or chess version, a competitive abstract game but it is muddled up some inelegant rules and possible actions which prevents the game to flow and instead every turn feels like a damp squib. I am sure some people will like this game, but it did not hit a nerve with me. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>As much as I like the Back to the Future movies, this card game is not much fun. Yes, it may be based on a great license but the novelty quickly wears off, given that there are only two sides to every &quot;card&quot;. Thus, Emmet Brown is either dead or alive. The idea of changing the course of history in order to make sure you are still alive in the future is a great one and would make for a great game but this is not it. It is very random and that makes fun if not taken seriously, but any form of strategy you might have is redundant.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Maybe I should have played this with more than 4 players, but if the box says 4 players or up, I assume it works with that number and is not &quot;really the same game&quot; (quote). I found this boring and dull, more like a random trick taking game, almost zero strategy and way too much luck for a game that simple. Not my cup of tea. I much prefer the similar Cash N Guns.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>At first sight, the scoring system and rules seem way too fiddly for what this game actually tries to be. A guessing game a la 20 questions (Yes/No answers) and the clues are models made of plasticine. Way before Dixit, this game forces the players to create their models in a way that they give away enough to be guessed but not too early or too late. Some people will be annoyed by the clunky way this game goes about its business and also the roll-and-move portion of the game which can win you the game if you&#039;re lucky. I think this game is okay, but all the mechanics and tweaks don&#039;t change the fact that this game is pretty much a light 20-Questions clone and if that is something you don&#039;t enjoy, this game won&#039;t change your mind. I think there are better and more interesting party games out there, so I will probably trade this away. </comment>				</item>

I am not sure how replayable this is, given that some combos are more lethal than others, but I do like this. A shame it&#039;s only two player, will see less play than it ought to.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A typical Knizia game that reminds me of Lost Cities but this one is much harder and even a tad vicious. Keeping an overview over all the cards that have been played both by yourself and the opponent can be quiet the drill. It takes a few plays to become fluid in this game, but then it is a very dense and focused two-player skirmish. I do like it, not keen on the &#039;theme&#039; or the artwork but it is a Knizia so that is what I had to expect really.</comment>				</item>

Instead of game board there is a game map, which unfolds into a landscape on which the battles take place. By now, I realize Battle Masters is pretty much the most toned down version of miniature wargaming you can find, but it is good for young kids or people who prefer a simpler and more in-your-face approach to war gaming. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>This is the first semi-cooperative game I played and I enjoyed it very much. Great mechanics and lots of variety in possible strategies, both for the good and evil players. There are a few reasons why this is not a 10 to me. 1: The Theme, I am not a Sci-Fi fan and never saw a single BG episode, so it does not add or take anything for me. If anything, it makes the game harder to relate to. 2: The game encourages social gaming, a lot ! So if you are playing with people who are not into that, the game loses lots of its appeal. Also, the is a lot of accusing, nastyness and betrayal going on, which can be fun, but some people may not like that sort of interaction. 3.) Experienced players have an advantage over newbies. Other than that, Amazing game.#

EDIT: I would rathe this a 10 for the game that takes place before the Cylon(s) is revealed, it becomes less exciting and rather anticlimactic afterwards.

EDIT: Played Shadows over Camelot for the first 2 times today and must say that it is the superior &#039;traitor&#039; game, not by much but still. I prefer the theme, playing time and nature of the climax.</comment>				</item>

Many of today&#039;s Eurogames could learn from this, stop looking so terribly dull, the war is over for god&#039;s sake. Anyway, Bazaar is fun and played it loads with my Dad. It is a good gateway game for children because it does not deal with stocks, bonds or war but can be quite hard to master, yet simple to pick up.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Very fiddly game and flimsy pieces which does not really affect the gameplay but it is just something I noticed, especially due to the fact that the game has been published by WOTC, one would expect better production values. 

The game plays very counterintuitive and the board, character discs, cards and tokens are all very hard to make out and most of the game&#039;s downtime is generated by those issues. Furthremore, I am not a big fan of player elimination and in both games I played I ended up sitting around doing nothing for ages, not good. 

Once the haunt starts, the chaos begins. The basic idea is nice but having two times 50 sets of rules each time you play makes it utterly chaotic and nobody really knows (and cares) what is going on anymore. In both games I played, all players were disinterested after a while.

A disappointment.

	<numplays>31</numplays>			<comment>One of the best quiz games out there. Interesting and lots of questions. Nice design and good range of topics. The added spice due to the special ability tokens (change topics, challenge opponenets) make it even more of an interesting game, especially when compard to dust collectors such as Trivial Pursuit and the like. The degree of difficulty varies quite a lot between questions sometimes and that can cause some distress, but then again, there is an equal chance to get an easy question for all teams </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I am big fan of the original Bezzerwizzer and I was excited to finally play this &quot;Deluxe&quot; version, even though it turned out to be a family (i.e. kids) version. This edition has three basic problems:

1. The rules are incredibly complicated. Not the basic flow of the game but what to do when playing the various categories. Takes way too much time to figure it out

2. The game is just way too easy. I did not get a single  question wrong, neither did  the others. No challange for adults. I feel like this is meant to be played with kids only

3. The game tries to be too much at the same time. The idea with the xylophone is neat, but there is remebering words, pictures, stories .... just too much cats in one bag to not cause confusion. Keep it simple. Do a Bezzerwizzer Memory or Bezzerwizzer Music, dont mash it up in one behemoth of a party game.

Shame really </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>An interesting idea, but not much of a game in the finer sense of the word. Anyone who remembers the infamous riddles and ghost stories people would tell in camp or around the campfire, should be familiar with the concept behind this product. Some stories are more interesting than others, let alone believable or credible, so that makes for a slightly unbalanced drop in quality at times. Like so many communication games, the fun you will have depends highly on the group of people around the table. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Like many social games, this one is fun with the right people. Similar to Dixit or Nobody is perfect, this one is about making up answers that people fall for while guessing the right answer. This time, it is about captions for photos. However, not all pictures are as fun as some others, and some rounds will be way more pleasant than others and many &quot;captions&quot; can be guessed as there is only so much room for interpretation in a &quot;real&quot; photograph. I do prefer Nobody is perfect because knowing the right answer is almost impossible and the questions more varied. Also, I am not a big fan of games that involve writing and reading out answers as this usually drags the game down and issues with peoples&#039; handwriting etc. distort the chances of some. Still, played with the right people, this one is an easy and nice way to end a gameday.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Interesting game which could do with a bit more randomness even and diversity in cards and tiles, but I presume the designers tried to keep it simple. I found it odd (not bad mind you) that the game becomes easier in terms of resource abundance and possibilities. Yet, due to the fact that this goes for all players the race for the win becomes really fast towards the end instead of weighing and slowing down in the end like many other eurogames. The theme is terrible, generic semi-fantasy, a bit more effort would have been appreciated. Will definitely play again to see how it holds up.</comment>				</item>

This game can really shine when you have people who take the whole trading shebang to heart and offer, negotiate and cause some sort of general market atmosphere to ignite. In general, i found the game to be quite close in the end, just because the &quot;range&quot; of points never really tilts out of the average. The theme itself is surprisingly cute and works well with the whole growing of plants thing. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>A simple game with enough interaction and ideas to make it slightly better than other efficiency engine games (RFTG / San Juan). The interaction is there, players&#039; income is partially dependent on what other players do, are they building mines in your town, using your bar etc. The theme is plastered on but it works fine, alas, it is a bit too cartoonish for me but that does not matter much. Not a bad filler that is. HX</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting game with a light theme that works really well. There was not much backstabbing and thugging going on in our game but I can see it escalating and await more plays in anticipation of this. The game looks older than it is, like an MB or Parker game from the 90ies or 80ies, maybe that is why it has flown under the radar so far ? Good mechanics, plays quick and lots of interaction going on, deals, threates etc. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The basic idea is not bad, albeit nothing new or innovative. However, I feel that the game is either broken or terribly unpolished, The way players are distributing their cubes amongst the cities just does not feel right. You should not be allowed to pass and just wait for others to move first, unless their is either a benefit in going first or a penalty in going last. As it stands, I do not like this game, because I think they did not playtest and polish it thoroughly. </comment>				</item>

The core mechanic, which is stacking your pirate discs on top of each other and thus making it possible to attack ships and still being able to see who is part of the crew in the first place is really what this game is all about. Good, keen to play more </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Yes, it is a really silly game and good fun to see your gaming friends sticking their tongues out but as a game, there is not much there. It is more or less an exercise in quick computing and visual perception (calculating the the best score based on the visual clues on the cards). What I did not like is the lack of interaction between the players, you could play this with two, or even on your own and it would almost be the same game. 

EDIT: I enjoyed it slightly more this time than the last time I played it, but still, I know that the sole reason why I like to play this at all is to see my friends making funny faces and saying things with their tongue stretched out. All that tells me is that I should play more hands-on party games. Maybe not this one.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>33</numplays>			<comment>I like games with an unique twist and pointing guns at other players can certainly be called as much. A good &quot;social&quot; game which does not really have an intriguing or game-shaping mechanics and I am yet to see players develop a &quot;strategy&quot; out of the mess and raucous. Anyhow, good for what it is and I am sure the advanced game will give it more flavour and edge.

EDIT: Yes, this is &#039;just&#039; a bluffing game and a simple one for that but by measuring the amount of fun and laughter I experience when playing this game, this tops the ranks of my ratings, so there you go, 7.5 to 9.</comment>				</item>

It is more ore less a roll and move and die rolling game and that is what it comes down with a few exceptions thrown in here and there through cards and abilities. Not a clever game and not an innovative game but just plain and simple and worth your while if there is nothing else to do. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The second expansion I bought for the Z-Man game line of collectible card decks (Grave Robbers etc.) I think the Cannibal &amp; Jungle theme does not work as good as the other expansions. It does not feel as B-Movie esque as the others, because there are not many B-Movies concerned with jungle crawling out there. It adds nice touches to the basic game and should definitely be on the radar of Grave Robber fans, but maybe you should think about going for the other themed packs instead.</comment>				</item>

The gameplay elements are nice and the expansion adds goods produced by your cities, pigs for the farms and building masters.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>An interesting rendition of classic Carcassonne which takes what is unique about Carcassonne (the freeform tile laying) and turns it on its head by introducing the spatial restriction which offers new strategic problems and perspectives. I like the scoring system and the random bonuses mix it up a little and break up the traditional non-luck Euro flow of the original game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Definitely the only Carcassonne-spin off I have enjoyed so far, which might come down to the fact that this is designed by the same designer as the original and it shows, not just some random company cashing in on the name. The game is definitely more complex and intricate than Carcassonne but not necessarily better. In fact, I still think the original is superior but this is a welcome spell of fresh air. The game takes a bit too long (with four players at least) for what it is, but never mind. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A nice Carcassonne variant, which feels different enough to warrant a new game I suppose. I feel that is plays quicker and is also more luck-based (or push your luck) than the original and less complicated (no farmers etc.). The artwork is nice as well and I actually prefer it over the original. Good if you want to play something like Carcassonne but burner out on the original. On the other hand, if you are looking for the superior experience, there is no reason not to choose the original, so this is more or less a novelty alternative.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A complex tile-laying, puzzle/efficiency game. The artworka and theme is amazing and what makes the game truly shine, I just wish that there would be a few more thematic things, like events or citizens with specific behaviours that influence the game etc. Still, there are dice and gunfights. It will take a few plays to get your head around the strategy, but that is the case with most games. Solid stuff. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played it once and did not like. I feel that even in the &#039;skill&#039; game there is too much luck and randomness involved. Yes, in theory you might want to look out for what everyone else has when it comes to cards and which cards are available to draw but that is no &#039;fun&#039; and feels like work and so everyone just tries to make the most of his cards and positions and let&#039;s see what happens. Not a bad idea, just too light for my taste. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>I played this game again and for some miraculous reason, I did enjoy it after all. It plays quick and the action choice mechanism is interesting and quite balanced when it comes to the interaction between player and makes things like turnorder very important for your strategy. It takes  a while to grasph all the different possibilities (worker placement for VPs) but once you get it, it&#039;s cakewalk. I can see how some people might feel this game gives you too many options without doing anything to influence or steer your decision through events / phases etc, but there are always the winter cards to mix things up. Gorgeous artwork and a nice theme round this up. Good stuff !</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The game takes a long time to get going, the initial 5 minutes are very dull. The limited action more or less nullify some turns. With four players, this is very underwhelming and I am not sure what to think of a card game that is supposed to work with as few as three but needs at least 6 to shine, it is rarely going to happen. Neat idea but the execution is a bit lacklustre.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Not much about this that interests me. Only limited strategy and interactivity and I really do not like the way the game cannot decide whether it is a cooperative or competitive game and as such and I never feel like I know what I am doing or should be doing, not a good sign when playing a game. The artwork is not nice and almost abstract, the could have put more effort in emulating the theme. Too simple and generic for me. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Just another Yahtzee Clone. Roll the Dice and try to get the right combos in three attempts in order to buy the necessary items (here: roads, cities, etc) to give you the most victory points. With more than one players, people just take turns into playing solitaire and compare points at the end. Why no trading of dice or stealing of dice ? Or limited supplies or locations to build ? Not enough interaction to make it worth your while playing this with others. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Found it for 1 Pound at a Charity Shop in London. A very &quot;simple&quot; game, in terms of rules at least. I do like the game very much, I do have the wooden pieces edition and it the bits look and feel great, like chess pieces. When I played this game I noticed that players will quickly start to create strategies and try out tactics, becoming more involved in the game. The game does not work well with players of different playing strength, because there is no luck involved at all. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>CITOW is definitely a FFG game. You can tell by the mechanics, the bits and the theme. But also because it is a mixture of other FFG games, effectively it borrows a lot from Middle Earth Quest, BSG and War of the Ring. Anyhow, it is a good game and all the Ameritrash laurels are in there, various player powers, flavouring, global effects, specific effects, dice and so forth. I never played Warhammer before but I feel it emulates the gritty world quite well. The strategies are varied and I enjoyed how the outcome could not be predicted by the veteran player. Still, I would have been more impressed by this if it was not for many similar games by FFG I have player before. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A neat cutthroat negotiation game. And when I say negotiation, I pretty much summarised the game already. The whole game hinges on the players&#039; willingness to take part on frantic, fun and feisty negotiations with each other. Imagine Settlers of Catan&#039;s trading phase: The game and you almost know all Chinatown is about. The theme and art is neat but more or less pasted on. Like the game, but I can see how some might fail to actually see the game in here (lack of mechanics) but to me, the interaction is where it&#039;s at anyway, so I enjoy this kind of game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The game is actually less complicated than it looks and despite some fiddly stuff and not very elegant design (not the mechanics but the upkeep of available food, population limit etc.). I like that there are really not a lot of victory conditions like in many other games and even though there are always quite a few choices to be made, the focus never derails and the goal is clear. I wish the game would have more streamlined and you make a lot of mistakes just because there are so many things to keep track of and the game does not help you in doing it. The game is confrontational without being vicious because if you steal people, you have to feed them after all. Maybe it could have done with a bit more card variety and randomness, but that would probably made it much less of a euro.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Me and my friends played this and we spend whole nights with this game. I found the history theme a bit heavy and dry (I was 12 for god&#039;s sake) but enjoyed it more as I got older. A nice game, not for non-gamers though. Simple in mechanics, yet epic in scope.

EDIT: Played it again after almost 15 years. Still enjoy it, good pre-Euro / Euro mechanics although there is a lot of counting and bookkeeping involved which makes the game unnecessary fiddly and number-crunchy. Still, a great game. I will have to play this with more players in order to evaluate its true potential though. 

EDIT2: Played it again for the second time and it dragged on a bit. I feel that there is not enough happening to warrant the prolonged playing time and the calamities felt really unbalanced (flood does nothing sometimes, famine can wipe out an entire civilization). I noticed that the fun factor depends on how you play this game with. With wargamers and heavy euro games, Civ is lots of fun, but for connoisseurs of modern and more streamlined games, Civ can be quite tedious.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The basic idea is not bad but the game does not click with me. You just do some semi-random abstract moves and hope for the best. When we played, the whole concept of keeping you colour hidden, as appealing as it sounds in theory did not matter at all and we just tried to maximize points. The player who tried to hide his colour until closer to the end, came in third. I am sure there is some strategy to it but even if you would figure it out, how many meaningful and complex (satisfying) decisions are there to be made in this game ? Not a lot I reckon. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The game is definitely more flexible than it first looks with only two types of monster miniatures and three types of heroes, not a lot of cards etc. The scenarios make it interesting and it is definitely more interesting both in theme and in execution than the similar Castle Ravenloft but I still think it is a shame this was not produced by FFG who could have beefed it up with content and just more of the same instead of this careful &#039;light&#039; approach which needs more expansions to be the milestone it could be. A bit more flavouring (in the bits and tiles) as well as in the rules and on the cards would have been nice too.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>An interesting spatial puzzler, that is almost more of a toy than a game. I am not sure there is a lot of strategy to it, more a question of tactics, but the winner can pretty much be decided by one or two moves in the end instead of any sort of long-term performance throughout the game. Maybe this is a good thing and the game would be too harsh if people would be eliminated too early but this means it also feels like you have less control. Still, the way it breaks the mold of your usual boardgame experience is definitely worth the time. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Enjoyed playing this with my dad. It is a good variant of the hidden movement game (such as Scotland Yard or Fury of Dracula). The artwork and playing pieces are very nice and the mechanics work well. I also enjoyed being subject to motion alarms and cameras. A nice way to track the bad guys movement was to actually nick the paintings from the gameboard, which added greatly to the rage of the detective and the fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>51</numplays>			<comment>A neat little cardgame which takes up more place than your usual cardgame. Basically a trick taking game with two severe differences. A. There is more than one active pile of cards in on the table B. You can &quot;choose&quot; which colours give you a bonus and which ones a minus.

Two little elements which make the Coloretto experience unique. There is enough tactics and strategy to make it engaging but not too much to undermine the basic idea of a swift card game. Colours work better than numbers anyhow and Coloretto does that right. 

Nice Filler.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I like this game although there are some points of criticism I have. The game does not change as you get further into the game and repeating the five steps over and over again is a bit dull at time. Also, and that might have been due to the group I played with, the auctioning and trading was not that exciting and most of the time there was none of either. So, it more or less came down to the inital tile draw and a bit of luck. 

Lovely components though I just do not see more than the sum of its parts.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>An interesting &quot;game&quot;, even though I consider it more of a collaborative creative activity, like Charades. The &quot;rules&quot; are not actual rules at all and as soon as you get going, you toss the &quot;rules&quot; and scoring system overboard anyway and start having fun with the board and cubes. Still, it might be a tad too free-for-all for actual gamers and I would suggest playing this with a good mixture of gamers and non-gamers, maybe even the latter exclusively. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>A card game that pretends to be an area control game. The board does not add a whole lot to the game but I suppose it is slightly more interesting than just adding up some scores on a sheet or moving a cube up a point scale. The game is good and more tactical than it would seem at first glance. I still think that some of the cards are overpowered and can win the game too soon and too easily and that can be frustrating. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Very well produced and gorgeous Stratego clone with a big chunk of deduction thrown it. Might not appeal to lighter games because it is a bit of a brain burner despite its very simple rules but then again it feels like and old/classic game, so friends of Stratego or Chess might like it. The theme is okay, but the production value makes up for it. Great idea to make the assignment of movement capabilities with the pieces random ! </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I was lucky enough to play this little gem with the designer during a protoype session, when he brought along the game to Cologne on Board. Given that this game is still in development, I wont write a full review but a lengthy comment instead.

The theme is captured very nicely, both in terms of the visual style (reminiscient of GTA) and mechanics, with lots of potential screwage, careful planning that can go wrong, some risk taking, some limited luck and of course negotiations and fragile alliances. Some people on the other table said, overhearing us play sounds like an episode of Breaking Bad and that is not far off ... 

Every round (a total of four) you associate an action / order card with one of your gangsters of varyiing strength. Once the whole planning is done, you have to choose the order in which you execute the former, which can work out as perfectly as you planned it but can go horribly wrong as well, either out of bad luck (rarely) or because someone double-crosses you or sabotages you in some way (more often than one would wish for). Then again, doing the same to other Dons is a hella lot of fun. 

Despite a tangible lack of in-game controlled balance mechanics (leader bashing and trailing off is both very well possible), the players I played with restored the balanced and the finish was very close, for a game featuring such an liberal degree of player-guided targeting. 

I found the negotiations particularly delightful, because only a very (!) limited number are binding and many other deals a based on pure trust - but are actually based on some evil plan, revenge, vendetta or sheer meaningness more often than not. 

All in all, I found this to a very exciting mixture of action planning, negotiation (interaction) and some luck. It might be a bit too harsh and confrontational for some family/Euro-Gamers, but then again, this game might not be for them. 

My only drawback (after one play mind you, maybe it is just a wrong initial impression) is the lack of a catch-up mechanism. 

Kudso to the game designer for demoing his game at a local game group with such patience, passion and - most of all - fun. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>My My, how expectations can be wrong, at least so it appears. This has been on my must-have list for quiet some time, despite the fact that I never played it. Now, I had the pleasure of trying it for the first time and was royally flabbergasted by it. It is a very simple game, which is not a bad thing, but it is so random and yet at the same time limited in its possible strategic decisions that I never really experienced the sensation of playing a &#039;game&#039; in the true sense of the word but experiencing a cascade of random events unfolding before my eyes. The destiny cards are the first thing that I found bizarre, if you cannot choose who to attack, the winner of the game can solely be determined by card draw. Yes, yes, you might form alliances, but who would ally with you unless necessary anyway and then, where is the strategical decision ? Same goes for defending. The abilities are a good idea, but I found that too far in the game-breaker instead of tactic enhancer field. All in all, I am still astonished by the mediocrity of this game and will most definitely have to play it again and make sure whether it was just a one-off bad experience.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Quite an interesting &quot;Alternative&quot; to The Resistance or other &quot;hidden identity&quot; games in the same vain. Yet, I found this to be quite hard to get into. Maybe because it takes quite a few plays to learn all the roles by heart, but remembering who claimed to be what and when the players swapped their (alleged) roles through the ambassador is not as easy at it sounds. Still, I am curious to see how the experience might change once I play it a few more times, but for now, I would prefer The Resistance or Werewolf. Also, I found that more than once, there was only one choice left ( and one possible winner left) in the game, something I dont really like in games. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Cranium is one of the best family/friends/party games, using the usual charades, trivia questions, drawing challenges and the forth. Of course, the game walks and falls with the players you surround yourself with. If they are resistent to singing, acting or whistling, you will have no fun at all. I am not saying this is not a good party game, but I am not a fan of the genre in general.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A pretty heavy euro-game, not because the mechanics or concepts are much deeper or more complex than other euro-games but the designers clearly had no intention of keeping it focused and simple and added lots of different things that go on at the same time. The game could have worked with 2 out of 4 of the present core mechanics/engines but then it might have been whole different and much lighter game. I do like it, although I think there could have been more variety when it comes to the buildings (random order) and events, but what gives. A good game and gorgeous to look at. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I did enjoy it to a certain degree. I like the &#039;theme&#039;. although it is more or less an euro resource gathering game. One of the players dubbed it as &#039;maybe-cooperative&#039; and that nails it. Indians or Cowboys can decide to work together in order to prevent the other faction from getting the edge when it comes to acquiring resources. However, in our game, the players just kept screwing each other randomly and it kind of took the fun out for me. As much as I like to win a game, I cannot back-stab people, so any game that requires me to do so is not really my cup of tea. I would definitely play this again, but only with the right people.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played this at my local game club and enjoyed it very much. It reminded me of HeroQuest. In my opinion, a few game mechanics too many and not enough random element triggers too make the game more non-tactic dependent. But still, I am looking forward to playing this more and maybe owning at some point.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Much better than I expected after hearing so many horror stories, but I can see how this might go awfully wrong. Our group was fantastic, many of my close friends and easy going newcomers. But, the game itself is not really what makes or breaks the experience but the players and my rating incorporates the assumption that you play with the right group, because the game itself, in terms of design and intrinsic value is not necessarily that great (the basic idea is good). Still, a fantastic experience.</comment>	<conditiontext>Avalon Hill Edition</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>25</numplays>			<comment>Your Dixit experience really depends on who you are playing it. Playing it with hardcore gamers will result in consecutive moaning about how this is not a game. Playing it with geeks will result in myriads of LOTR and Dr. Who references being thrown around the table. If you play it with a healthy mix of open minded people it is great fun. Lots of laughs and great insights into peoples&#039; personalities. The scoring system is incredibly confusing though and nobody, inlcluding the owner did not get it. Lovely game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The game is not as complex at people have you think, at least the rules are not. The most complex issue with this game is the fact that all actions are available from the very beginning. Of course, some of them do not make a whole of sense at first and chosing them as your action might be quite foolish, but it is a long and winding road until you figure that out for yourself. The game is quite abstract and so are the &#039;depictions&#039; of the species, dominance and so forth (cubes, cones), but the flow of the game and the dynamic of conflicting species is very on theme and has been a surprisingly involving experience even if compared with games which are actually trying to be thematic (and are not). The final scoring is kind of overpowered in my opinion but that is not too bad. The game takes a long time and really melts your brain, I wonder if you could play it with less cards (12 and the Ice Age card) ? Anyhow, a good game and if it was not for the time and effort it takes to play this, I would have rated it much higher.

EDIT: Played again and the same thing happened AGAIN. Rush for empty tiles at the end and too much chaos that really unbalanced the game. Rating slipped down. For a game that takes this long and feels so intricate, there are too many things and special abilities that throw the balance. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>Finally got around to play it and am a bit disappointed. For a boardgame, it is not very interactive and every player is kind of brewing his own soup and you can pretty much play the game while ignoring the other players. Especially with experienced players / seasoned players, the game plays very fast and more like a quick game of cards (without any bluffing/betting etc), rendering the in-game communication to a minimum. The theme is quite generic and I would have prefered a more gritty setting, dark ages instead of medieval. I quite like the idea of a new and random set up of cards each time you play, but overall. the player-player interactivity is way too limited for a boardgame.

EDIT: I had the chance to play it again with three out of four players (including me) being newbies and inexperienced and I had more fun this time. I actually noticed what was going on and at least attempted to think of something which remotely resembled a strategy. I reckon if I would play this game with a bunch of new players who play this game SLOWLY (what is it with some geeks, going for the speed record, how fast can I play the game?), I would enjoy it more. I think Dominion can be played fast, but I would rather play it with people that take longer to make their move and give me more time doing mine. Anyway, I like it better than the first time and I will play it again, but I am still not convinced it is such a great game. HX

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Not as good as I though it might turn out to be. The basic idea is great and the asymmetrical game design is pretty neat, but I still found that there was never much strategy to my decision. On the other hand, maybe that is why I did not win and I should play again to see if the strategy is not hidden under some rocks ? A good game, but not fantastic. I will have to play it again and the rating can go either way. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I am impressed by game designers that are courageous enough to rely on pure and solid communication to solve in-game issues, especially if the core principle on the game is built upon that very aspect. A cutthroat negotiation game. If the time runs out, nobody gets the loot. This game can really go awkward when played with the wrong people but I do like my games dangerous now and then and it can really spice up and evening of dusty euros. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A simple and chaotic racing game. Good for kids and for adults that really like their dragons. The minitatures and artwork are great (except the board though). Still, for kids who are into the Dragonology books, this is fun. As a game, it is oddly underwhelming, and 80 % of the game is luck, rolling the dice, drawing cards and so forth, to put it plainly, the game is an eccentric form of waiting. HX</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>A pretty and simple confrontational, almost abstract 2-player game. Not sure who repetitive it can get because I think there are only a handful, if not less, good tactics for either side and the rest comes down to lucky draws. But still, lovely board and miniatures and quick playing time make this a keeper for me. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>As an avid fan of Ameritrash, randomness and dice rolling, this game is supposably right up my alley. I played in a bit of rush and withouth indulging in the flavour texts and really enjoying what makes this game unique, the bizarre mixture of characters, weapons etc. from all ages and the odd combinations and &#039;stories&#039; it creates. So my rating is more or less for the mechanics and the basic idea but I must play this again, with more time and dedication to the flavouring in order to really evalaute what it could do for me. I think the multitude of availbale skills makes it unnecessary fiddly. Why not stick with Strenght, Intellgence, Speed and leave it at that ? Still, a great game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Way too fiddly for my taste. I dont like the idea of each player having his own little boards. It might work for Puerto Rico but it does not for Dungeon Lords, it feels like playing a solitaire game with some people sticking around. The only fun elements are those in which players &quot;sort of&quot; interact, but that element is orphaned within the rest of the overloaded rulesfest. Not my kind of thing.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Played this game for the first times(s) today and fairly enjoyed it. However, the game is a bit too simple for me and the theme (I loathe the &quot;world&quot; of Dungeons &amp; Dragons) is too generic. The game features your usual random mix of supersimplified post-Tolkien wash outs, ranger,cleric, fighter, skeletons, ghoul etc., nothing new but old ideas recycled into something worse. The game itself is rather repetitive and I am not sure whether this will change with later scenarios (played the 1st and 6th). Furthermore, it looks like WOTC supplied the minimum amount of monsters, scenarios and heroes only to make this heavily expendable and cash in. If you compare the amount of bits and bobs in this game with the similar Descent or Arkham Horror, it looks pathetic. All in all, a nice dungeon romp and probably and nice fantasy-gateway game but unless I get in in a trade, I cannot see myself purchasing it at any point in the future.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A very basic HeroQuest clone. I still prefer HeroQuest over this game though as I was never fond of the D&amp;D world. The miniatures and pieces are much nicer and the variety of items makes looting much more fun. But I found the scenarios included, apart from being not many, rather uninteresting and not maximizing what you could have gotten out of this game system.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played this Essen 2011 hype monster only once. It is a neat game but all in all, it is not as good as people make it out to be, at least, not for me. The theme does not interest me at all. Whenever people moan about the same old generic fantasy mumbo jumbo, like orcs, elves and dwarfs, I get excited, I am a post-Tolkien man through and through. But talk to me about wormholes, plasma guns and planets and I start snoring sooner than you can say &#039;Bones McCoy&#039;. 

Apart from that, I found that the game lacks interaction, where is the trading, diplomacy, sweat-inducing negotiations, alliances, laws that bind you you to do certain things, interactive victory conditions (apart from wars. Most of the time, I found that people just build and dwell on their little separate boards in Agricola style and I general don&#039;t like games where people have their own boards, that spells multi-solitaire like nothing else. 

Also, just like many &#039;old&#039; wargames (Game of Thrones / Risk), this game has no catch-up or balancing mechanism in place for players who get left behind. Unlucky tile draw in the first few rounds ? Tough cookies, you are probably out of the winner&#039;s race for good. Two players decide to crush the last player and eliminate him from the game ? Call your grandma, your coming home, but the game does not help you at all. How about bonus chips for whoever has the lowest in science, resources and money each turn ? Something like that would cut it, so the design, while elegant and polished is outdated in my opinion.

On the upside, I do like the playing time, rules are clear and the design feels polished so that the flow of the game is very good, when compared to similar games such as Twilight Imperium.

If you love space games that are a tad dry and Euro, this is for you. To me, it feels more like space tax return than space opera, too much work, not enough fun.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A rather light Euro game disguised as a fantasy-themed light wargame without the (direct) confrontation and bloated rules. Most of the crux in this game lies in positioning and moving your cubes to gain dominance and majority in specific areas, depending on your VP conditions and cards. The variable leaders add more layers to the tactics without breaking the game, because we are talking about 1, maybe 2 points here. Yet, I found the limited interaction a bit dissapointing. Of course, you can keep your eyes peeled and observe what cards the others are picking and which winning course they are going for but most of the time your are concerned with complimenting your deck with new cards. Also, I found this a tad too light to fill the slot of the main dish in a game night but too complex to be a filler, let alone the fact that it does not bring anything new to the table (the alleged playing time of 8 minutes comes to 8 minutes per person for sure). </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>A lighter version of Struggle of Empires. Less direct conflict and no alliances. Still, a neat efficiency machine game with enough interaction to make it worthwhile. The rules are simple but there are many strategies to go for and many options you have, especially in the early stage of the game. A bit more randomness would have please my chaotic nature but it does not feel incomplete without. Neat and tranquil artwork etc. rounds the experience up. Good one.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>As a kid, I found the prospect of the gameboard being a sinking island amazing and I reckon I still would. Although I tweaked the rules heavily to turn it into a sort of Survival/Disaster game, the base game is quite good as well and a nice way for kids to be introduced in fantasy boardgaming. 

EDIT: I played this again and found it really fun. Nice components and screwage without being too serious.

EDIT2: Played it once more and found it a bit longish and too random</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A very fun and interesting &#039;get to know each other&#039; variant which is all about people guessing about values, traits etc. and how they relate to the other players and the group in general. A good game and with the right group, social and funny people, this is a big hit. Still, the game in here lies in enjoying the company, there are not a lot of mechanics here, although there are still more than it all other games of this kind I played so far. 

EDIT: Played it again and I found it a bit too complicated to drawn people in for what it is. Not enough game to engage people but too much to explain to interest people in the first place. Also, many of the concepts in the games are just too abstract to be interesting unless people are willing to talk and discuss them during gameplay which most of the won&#039;t be ready to do. I do like the idea of this, but the execution is just to naive and will not work as a game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I think the game itself is not bad, even quite interesting, the boats moving around the board is a neat idea and makes for some hard decisions. The randomness is fine and there is some interaction, although screwing other people ultimately hurts yourself so I felt like there was a tendency to leave each other alone. Anyhow, the reason while I will never play this game again and while I rate it so low is the horrible theme.

Players kidnapping animals from an island and selling them to Zoos ? What is this ? The insane prisoner design company ? That is the most awful theme I have seen in ages, no way this will go down well with families, kids or people who like animals, so almost all gamers. Rubbish, whoever came up with it should be smacked around. So many themes would have done the same if not a better job, treasure hunters in the jungle for example ! Anyhow, average game, terrible theme, stay away.</comment>				</item>

Some of the answers and questions are a bit odd due to their age, but in my opinion this adds to its playbility because the game is not as knowledge dependent as it probably used to be and relies more on the memory aspect. The theme should appeal to Nostalgia and Americana Fans.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I have played this only once. While it seems very simple at first glance, there is more room for tactics / strategy than one might expect. Although this is what what makes this game a bit bland and unexciting as well. From the set-up to the conquering phase, there is no single element of luck or randomness, so it is all skill and strategy. A experienced player will wipe out a new player every time, not a bonus for me. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>I enjoyed this more than I thought I would because I am not a big fan of Friedmann Friese, mainly due to this themes. This game is very simple but good. The core mechanics are bluffing and bidding as well as reading the other players. Well balanced. 

EDIT: Played it a few times and found it can be a tad too random an unpredictable what to do and some of the guesswork is more luck than anything else (although it is of course another player&#039;s decision)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>A very simple game, inspired by Knizia&#039;s &quot;En Garde&quot; (it actually says that in the rulebook). A 2 player duel game with two characters moving across a bidirectonial board, attacking, pushing and dashing towards each other. Whoever hits wins the round (Best of 3). The game is very simple, cards are number 1 to 5 with 5 cards of each in the deck. Players use those cards to move spaces or attack (with the number being the distance). You can either block or retreat with the right cards, but if cannot do either, you lost. There are 10 characters in the game which have clearly been inspired by old-school beat-em up&#039;s (think Street Figher etc.) which makes sense as a theme considering the game depicts the &quot;duel&quot; between two characters. The characters come with three special abilities which add a bit more strategy although I found that they come into play rarely. All in all, a good filler game but there are tons of games out there I&#039;d rather buy, better 2-player games or games with more visual appeal. HX</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>I prefer this over Pandemic.  I like the theme and also the core mechanics which are essentially the same as Pandemic without all the bookkeeping and fiddlyness of the orginal game. We only played the normal difficulty and barely made it so there is plenty of challenge still to come. Hardcore gamers and strategist will probably find this underwhelming but I think it is a good light/family game to have in the collection. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The flavouring on this is really amazing. Although the theme (politics /  debate) is not really &quot;implemented&quot; because debates cannot really implemented into a boardgame (or can they, anyone fancy a challenge ?). Anyhow, it comes down to some middleweight euro brain teaser puzzling, figuring out how to score the most points. The cards and the respective events on them spice up the game and make it a tad more dynamic although some or way too overpowering and that does really not go well with theme (I would not mind anarchic and chaotic gameplay in a game other than debating founding fathers but it feels misplace in this one and kind of imbalances the game quite a bit). I love the flavour texts, the information about the delegates and articles and am looking forward to playing this with history buffs. 

Great one. HX</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>How this game could be considered to be awarded Spiel des Jahres is beyond me. The mechanics are recycled from a dozen other games and there is nothing unique, new, let alone interesting about them. Auction off turn order, secret action allocation and some area control and that&#039;s it. Another thing I do not like about this game is that wit and cleverness will not get you as far as analytical strategy, which is something that I don&#039;t want in my games. I want negotiation, assumptions, uncertainty, luck, randomness. Anyhow, Fresco is a mediocre (at best) euro.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I see what they did here. A collection of little games that emulate the feeling of being at a funfair. Sadly, it is more of a novelty item and all games are more or less just mini-games, that is, simple games with one or two mechanics that resemble other games. It is fun seeing your fellow players getting silly for once but as a game, this is an epic fail. My buddy bought this because he is a fan of the Brand design team, but I did not see their magic working in this game at all! Not my cup of tea. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Unlike many of my other gaming friends, I do not think this game is hilarious at all. So you&#039;re all having sex and taking drugs (you wish!) - What is so funny about that ? It&#039;s like being stuck in a loop of Southpark reruns, not funny once you think about it. The game is not bad but very luck based, what cards come up and what cards are in your hand. There is some planning etc. but not enough to make this worthwhile in my opinion. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Love this game. Finally got around playing it. Only downside is that it does not work to well with 2 players or 4 (downtime), so you really need to have 3 players or 5. You cannot solo it as well. Other than that. Amazing.

EDIT: The combat system is interesting on first sight but not varied enough to make it truly exciting with only a handful of cards available in the game at all. The same system would be great within a framework of mabye a hundred cards. Also, make sure to play this with Ameritrasher, all others will find the game boring. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>A rather clever game design and deceiptively simple because all you have to do in this game is create a spaceship out of tiles, more or less, a puzzle game, nothing more. But it is still fun, because the idea of competing against the other players who are also trying to create the perfect spaceship is great. I do not second the opinion that the exploration phase is no fun, I think it is  but I can see how some might find it too random and non-decision based. A good game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting update on the simultaenous action idea of Diplomacy with a spiced up setting that does a lot for A Game of Thrones fans and not much for people who have not read the book (like me), the game mechanisms are easier and more streamlined when compared to Diplomacy but it would be a stretch to call them elegant. The game is balanced not by in-game mechanisms (catch-up) but by the players itself and that is something I don&#039;t really like about wargames, and Game of Thrones for that matter. Once a player is behind, he is dependent on the mercy of others if he ever wants to catch up again and even if he does, he will be hard pressed to play a role in the outcome of the game as a whole. Apart from that, an okay game but boiling down a fantasy saga into nothing but a sophisticated risk variant does not really appeal to me. Like all games of this type, I enjoy the company more than the game itself.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>An euro-puzzler disguised as light Ameritrash game. While I do like cooperative games with a theme, I feel like this theme is spread too thin on the game, with the drawings looking like the come from the back of a cereal box and if compared to other theme-driven games (AH and FOD) this looks really generic and bland. Furthermore, it is a puzzler and brainburner and due to the lack of flavour texts, theme implementation and randomness, the theme is soon forgotten and people will concentrate on solving the game. The random setup is nice, although I do not like the colourcoding of monsters which gives the game less flexibility.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>A deceptively simple game, Jekyll &amp; Hyde (or Ghosts) is like Stratego Super-lite. Both players move their pawns across the board, both movement and &quot;combat&quot; is resolved by the same rules, just move sideways, fore- or backwards. Both players have to take out the four &quot;correct&quot; pawns of the enemy, while preventing from having your own takes. The crucial thing is however, that the other players cannot tell which of your eight pawns are the one he is supposed to catch. Thus, there is a lot of bluffing going on, luring the opponent into attacking the wrong pawns etc. A great and quick game. HX</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>A solid cardgame with a fantastic theme and artwork which really is what makes the game fun to play. Reading out the flavour text on the cards is tremendously entertaining if played with the right folks with a gloomy disposition. The game is good as well and the translucent cards and the ability to stack one on the other with some still being visible etc. is an unique mechanic and the most interesting aspect of the game.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Rather light family/Euro game. The artwork and presentation is nice, although the victory point papers are awful. I feel that the game is imbalanced in parts (the bonus 2 points / some of the bonus cards), but I reckon this is just the underlying family nature of the Euro game, making it less cutthroat and more luck-based in parts OR maybe I need to play it more to see how close the scores are and whether there are multiple paths to victory. Not as much interaction/confrontation as I though there would be, but still a neat game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Another recent card game that takes inspiration from the recent deck-building post-Magic trend. The theme does not do much for me, I have never been a fan of the &#039;Silly Greenskins&#039; approach that has been made popular by GW and this is no exception. I am more of a Tolkien-Orc kind of guy. Anyhow, theme aside (the artwork is not that bad), the game is pretty decent, but just like many cardgames of this type, it feels a tad solitaire. Most of the time, people are just pondering over their own card display and figuring out what to do next, occasionally influencing the other players&#039; game to a limited degree. It is this lack of interactivity that my biggest complain would be, I can see how you might almost be able to play this solitaire as the majority of the rules are concerned with the efficiency of your army structure than playing off your opponents&#039; game. Also, the game just takes too long, I would have been happy to play this game for half the length I had to when I sat down and played it for the first time and that is not a good sign. So, shorten it and maybe add some Interaction and I am up for it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The game started out quite interesting, I liked the way the three dice create a random set of available trains for each turn, but the map really breaks the game. The endgame is definitely broken and whoever managed to go up to Wales wins the game, hands down and that kind of neutralizes the rest of the gameplay as a whole. It is probably what you would expect and good enough for a game that came with a magazine but I cannot see myself getting more than 2 or 3 plays out of it ever. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting competitive puzzle game that does not show all it has to offer on a first play. The two boards make for an interesting mixture of &#039;game modes&#039;. Selecting the best possible move on the available resource matrix and then placing the factories/workers/roads is quite challenging. I found that the game has a tad too many options in the beginning and a and not enough things you can do towards the end of the game. 

I assume it was a first-play mishap but I won more or less through luck, that is, due to which specific bag of beans was still up for grabs to ship.

A second play could increase the rating.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>I am pretty sure everyone says that but this is essentially Tichu for 2-3 players. Why they did not make it 2-4 players is a mystery to me, but hey, so be it. An intelligent and intricate card game that is just complex enough to be challenging without being overwhelming. And it works as well with 2 as it does with more players. I know the &#039;theme&#039; is pretty much plastered on but I still prefer it over Tichu&#039;s. The lovely Scottish celtic artwork on the back of the cards and the earthy colours, all good.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s that one clever mechanic that makes this whole game stand out and be more entertaining that other variants of patience. However, I found the &#039;rules&#039; of giving tips and helping your fellow players just too vague to prevent players from cheating (unwillingly) and therefore breaking the game. What if you accidentally say something that is a tip or cannot help but making a face before someone throws off a card etc. Good for families and non-gamers and therefore, a good choice for the SdJ, but I am afraid hardcore gamers will solve this way too quickly. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Used to play this with my Dad and brother. Pretty much a game in the style of &#039;identity disguise&#039;, such as Mr.Jack or 13 Dead End Drive. While the playing pieces are not very nice to look at, the board and cards are quite neat. A simple game which nicely balances random elements (dice) and bluffing.

EDIT I: The game can really become surprisingly tense during the last stretch on the score track, when it is all about preventing others from winning while making sure your guy stays close enough for the snipe victory </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>The game that turned me into a geek. I used to play games such as Risk, Monopoly or Trivia games before. I found this in a department store and was blown away. I played this with myself for hours and hours. I never got around playing all of the extensions and sadly, the game was destroyed in a flood (no joke). I will try and pick it up again and play it again. Compared to all those heavy games which are available today, such as Descent, HeroQuest is very simple, but this might appeal to younger people, casual gamers or gamer girlfriends. There is still a nice HeroQuest online community, with new quests, spells, monsters etc. available for download.

EDIT: Played the first three quests last night and the game is still enjoyable more due to nostalgia and novelty than gameplay. It is just too easy for the heroes to win, there is no real challenge in the quests. I think I will have to tweak this and introduce campaign rules to make this interesting again. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The game is pretty much based on one clever game play mechanic and that is simultaenous choice of action(s). Yet, I feel that something is missing from the game and the odd extra mechanic would have been nice. Sometimes, especially at the very early and the late stage of the game, the choics just seem too limited and the information regarding the other players&#039; strategies and motives simply too easy to obtain. It also plays a tad too long for being so simplisitc. Then again, it might speed up and smoothen out with more plays </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Game design as simple and effective as it gets, relying purely on negotiation and communication. It reminds a bit of Dragon&#039;s Gold (which has been released later I know). The only criticism I have is that I think the colour coding, the different cards and the board could have been more efficient and less confusing when it comes to supplying the necessary information. 

EDIT (5 Plays): The more I play it the less I enjoy it. I still think the premise is good and with the right people, it can be a good laugh but sometimes I feel that there is next to no control over what happens and it all depends on random card draws. I would not mind that if it was not for the possibility to eliminate players by recruiting their investors, which is always a sure fire premature loss and that is utterly frustrating for the players. 

Also, I do not like the idea that you are able to divide the money (instead of shares) too, because it makes the game less cutthroat.

Had high hopes for this one but is just has not been properly thought through by Sackson.

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Ice flow does not play well with two players, there is not a lot going on and an abundance of resources everywhere for. Also, while I think you can play this game with a lot of planning ahead and cunning moves you do not have to and while this makes it a nice family game, it is the more underwhelming as a game for eurogamers. I like the bits and bobs and when reading the instructions, the game sounds somewhat exciting but it does not really come together well, at least not in a 2 player game.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I played this only once so I am not the best of judges but this did not really appeal to me. It is basically a mixture of acquire and risk, buying into countries while using the units to conquer territories. I found the game a bit dry and the rondell mechanic not very elegant, I would have rather had a classic turn order in which all players/countries resolve the same actions. This way, the game would be more tactical and less strategic. Also, it can be quite unbalanced and take too long and there is a lot of downtime should you be so unlucky and end up being Switzerland. Not a bad game but there are many similar games out there which are much better</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I only played this once so cannot really comment on replayability or how it holds up after multiple plays. I think it is a tad fiddly and I mean literally, the little road pieces and very small tokens but let&#039;s put those things aside, they do not really affect the game, albeit the gameplay. 

The game is a network (rail) building system about making sure to connect to other players&#039; networks and keeping them away from your. The road building in itself is not that exciting and only gets more tactical once the board is crowdd enough, which does not happen until the last two turns, so a missed opportunity to make something that is necessary, fun. 

I like the sun card mechanic and this is what makes the game worth playing in my opinion, it is a bit strange that not all combinations are available but what the heck, just take it into consideration. 

The theme is okay, a good idea and reflected in all aspects, from the artwork to the card art, but it is lacking a bit of additional flavouring. 

A good game if you are into rail-games. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A tile-lying game with a twist. A lot more interaction than the spiritual predecessor Carcassone, swapping tiles, swapping possession etc. The theme does not do much for me, generic sci-fi, rather bland but it works fine and kind of goes well with the idea of building a network/city. Some of the other players complained about the visuals, really small writing on the cards, no symbols to tell the buildings apart etc. No problem for me but I can see how it might turn other people off. I think a hand limit of five is too much (three would have done it) but better than drawing only one (as in Carcassonne). Great variation of the classic tile-laying game and I am looking forward to more plays. Not sure whether the high rating will hold up but we will just have to wait and see.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>It is hard to judge this from one play. It is definitely more complex and involved that LNOE, with an emphasis on ranged combat (death rays, ray guns, cannons etc.) which makes movement much more tactical. The theme is great, but maybe a bit too far out in order to evoke the same genre familiarity as LNOE, because the are rarely any alien movies around anymore, let alone alien movies set on a circus ground. Anyhow, the production value, balance and tongue in cheek humour is very good, like all Flying Frog games. This needs more plays with better knowledge of the rules to be fully appreciated. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Ouch, my heads hurts. This is an uber-complex puzzle game, about players constructing buildings (cards) from their hands and making sure that they can build them in a constellation and combination that guarantees the most points. Unfortunately, there are so many factors, concepts, abilities and last but not least combinations that this game turned out to be an exercise in AP and downtime. There are literally hundreds if not thousands of possible things to do and working out the perfect move within the given set of cards already on the table is very complicated. I think this game may appeal to a very small demographic of gamers and if the thought of pondering over a grid of numbers and symbols sounds like fun to you, this might be up your alley, alas, it is not for me. The interaction is too limited too, I would go as far as saying there is almost no interaction in the game, and that makes it even worse for me. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>A very light two player game that sounds utterly confusing if someone explains it but is really simple to pick up and play, it takes a few minutes to get your head around the underlying mechanisms and strategic implications of your possible actions but once your get going, this is great fun. A tad random and I feel that sometimes you can lose even if you did not make any mistakes, but that applies to many games. I like it, but it needs more plays. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I am yet to &#039;play&#039; the classic Junta and I heard many good (and some bad) things about it. So when I heard they were coming out with a new version I was quite keen to try it, expecting a tweaked and improved experience of an inelegant, older game. But from what I gather (reading reviews of the old game) and my experience with the new Junta, this is way too watered down and simplified and does not got anywhere near where the old Junta ventured. I found it underwhelming but I only played it with three players so that might have been the issue. But why print it on the box if it does not play well with three ? Anyway, did not impress me at all and I have no desire to play again.</comment>				</item>

There is not enough content that keeps me going, as the game plays too similar each time. The artwork etc. is a bit generic, the usual fantasy stuff. The board was quite interesting as it folded out later in the game, but that neat trick enough does not balance out the weak gameplay.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A neat little resource management game in the vain of Bazaar and Fresco. The way the resources are distributed (through player choice instead of die roll as in Catan) makes it much more balanced than many other games. On the other hand, the asymmetrical nature of the game can result in serious disadvantages if you screw up in the beginning. Also, I found that turn order becomes more important towards the later stage of the game, so going first in the last turn is a huge advantage and there should be a downside to it, or a catch-up mechanism of some kind. The artwork is horrible though. All in all, a solid Euro that is better than Catan (albeit similar) but nothing out of the ordinary.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>An unusual card game that takes only the most basic idea behind chess (the grid system, set movement rules, check/checkmate) and turns it into an abstract game played with cards. The game comes with many different little games in once and all resemble other games, like chess or poker etc. The game is not easy to learn and the iconography and rules don&#039;t help that much. Some people might want to put themselves through that to get to the core of the gameplay in this game but most will probably just play the proper games instead. I am kind of on the fence, the general idea of making a flexible card-based game like this is okay, but I would not rush to play it. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The simple mechanic of rolling the dice and &quot;deploying&quot; any subset of your dice to the board is really what this game is made of. The rest of the game is slightly below average and your run of the mill resource gathering, building and so forth. The artwork and theme are good but this game is a heavy Euro disguised as light Ameritrash. Player Interaction is limited, which would be my biggest complaint. Maybe allow players to trade, steal, switch resources / dice or else. Apart from the dice roll, no luck is involved which works fine in the game but I do prefer some luck in my games. At least, the success is not accumulative and the tide can change rather quickly, unlike in so many similar games.</comment>				</item>

As a game, it works quite well, although I never played it with actual gamers. It is a great game for kids and I wonder when someone will take the game concept and turn into an heavy game. Catan meets Heroquest maybe. It could be called Dungeon Escape and the players would have to escape the dungeon, being subjects to shifting tunnels/traps/monsters etc.

	<numplays>46</numplays>			<comment>Plays fast and the card system is fun. Immediate effects, countereffects and so forth. Feels like a good game of CCG sometimes.

EDIT: Played this many times with the right gruoup and the game turned out be the most balanced game I have come across since going back into boardgaming. Most games come down to the last turn(s) and it is always incredibly exciting. Especially considering this is a dicefest, that is an impressive deed. Love the theme and scenarios &amp; flavour. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Another card-drafting/engine builder/solitaire game. The theme and artwork (especially the artwork) are very nice but the game does not do it for me at all. There is almost no interaction in this game and everyone is just trying to create an (negative) engine to loose all his money first. Take cards, create combos with your actions, don&#039;t mind what the others are doing and whoever gets there first is the winner. Not my cup of tea, but I don&#039;t like games without interaction in general and this is one of the best examples of a game that I would not consider a boardgame in the first place (no board, no game). </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>A nice &quot;racing&quot; game, although it works quite different than other racing games. For starters, all players&#039; lemmings move the same amount of places, so there crux lies in the tactics, pushing your luck or hiding in the bushes (which costs more movement points), always keep in mind that eagles are hovering over the lemmings heads and while players take turns in controlling them, there is always a chance of guessing which way the eagles might fly and whose lemmings they eat. The special powers (cards that are dealt our at random) add some variety to the game. Luck is limited and Leaping Lemmings is really a game of strategy and pushing your luck. The theme works great (the farther the lemmings leap over the cliff, the more VP you get). Great game, too long for a filler but excellent to start off a game day/night.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I am not sure whether this is a children&#039;s game or not. One cannot tell by the artwork I&#039;d say. Yet the rules are so simple, I reckon it must be. Furthermore, the mechanics of the game simply do not work, period. Starting with the board (a depiction of Sherwood Forest and its surrounding areas), a third of it is useless and will never be frequented by the players, what does that tell you about the game design. Right, not playtested and polished. On top of that, the random cards players are dealt are way too random (d&#039;oh) too make the game balance and the only strategy players can engage in is damage reduction and finding the best thing to do with a crap hand which really should not be the case. With only six cards in your hands a very limited total options in the game, there is usually only one way to go about your turn, so there is pretty much no decision making in this game whatsoever. I am not even going to start talking about the game not being true to the lore (Robin Hood is fighting against his merry men). Yuks, what a stinker !</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I did not expect this to be quite so &#039;heavy&#039;, for a game based on a children&#039;s classic novel. Then again, why not challenge the brood here and then eh ? A good competitive puzzler with some limited interaction but a lovely theme and quick playing time. I am sure that some of the variants (2 player / bluffing etc.) add more spice to the stew. Kind of a galaxy trucker type puzzler without the real-time constraint. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I quite enjoyed it, it was better than I expected, some player interaction in the cards and the ability to pick up the discards of other players. The element of luck involved in drawing cards makes it more enjoyable than Agricola &amp; Puerto Rico. Still, 70 % solitaire, 30 % boardgame. Will definitely play again. The theme pushes its rating up for me, I am rather fond of London and the lovely art on the board and the cards is a bonus.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>My own vision of Tolkien&#039;s opus is way more gritty and darker than this game. That being said, I also dislike the game in here, it kind of plays itself, there is minimum strategy and too much luck, as compared to the similar competitive Beowulf. 

EDIT: Played it again with a nice group and more than 2 players and enjoyed it much more. Still a bit too luck based and limited in terms of control for me. Nice theme though.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A very interesting mix of luck (seems appropriate in a game like this) and solid Euro mechanics. The basic ideas are area control and a little bit of planning ahead, as well as pissing off your competitors. But when it gets down to the dirty stuff, it is all about dice rolling. I can see how some aficionados of balanced gaming and non-random Euro games will get a heart attack playing this but I think this is great fun and usually, the risk pays off, especially when you are playing favourable odds, but as well know, sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don&#039;t and that makes this game more fun than it should be. It looks gorgeous as well and all those many dice and paper money give you a bit of a Vegas feel as well. I enjoyed it a lot !</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>What a fantastic and elegant little game. My play partner told me it plays pretty much like Bridge, but I would not know, so this is probably why I am so impressed by this game. A reductionist approach to interaction but it is enough to make the decision you are taking turn by turn very important. It takes a few hands to get the hang of the right balance and I am not sure how this will hold up after dozens of plays, but for now, I am thoroughly impressed by this gem.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This game does have a handful of brilliant mechanics but unfortunately it adds a handful of more to the mix and bloats and otherwise great experience. The placement rules and trouble of getting your little cylinders back is lots of fun, simple to learn but hard to master. Yet, all the other things, the double sided tiles and especially (!) the abilities of the mission and various power tiles you need just make the game unnecessary complex and add more fiddlyness without making the game more compelling. I think this could have been a lighter but better game and as it stands it does not strike the right balance between playability and weight, because it carries a lot of excess baggage that just weighs it down. </comment>	<conditiontext>German Edition, some text on the cards but also symbols so it is language independent.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A pretty simple dice rolling game that is almost too simple for my taste, apart from a very limited things you can do, there is not much decision making involved in the game and the interactivity is limited too. I will have to play this some more but it might end up on the trade pile.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I have played it only once but found it to be a very good game. The theme is not for everyone and I have seen many people waving it off in sheer fear due to its &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;dry&quot; theme. As usual, if you look behind the theme, the game is a good one, which is not as hard to learn as the legend has it but very hard to master and definitely not for those players who do not like to think ahead. In fact, the crux of the game is that you are pretty much playing four game rounds at the same time, while the first one will be resolved next and so forth. Although I am German, the theme does nothing for me (Elections ? Yawn), but it does not deduce from the fun either and I suppose it is the only theme that works with all the mechanics, knotting them together in context. The theme and lack of randomness makes this a 9 for me and the fact that it rarely sees play pushes it down to 8.5. Nevertheless, a great game indeed ! </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>As good as it gets when it comes to card game design which pushed the boundaries of card games. The core is the role selection and a winning condition which makes the endgame rather frenzy and tactical (who will get there first). Rounded up by a nice light fantasy theme, which is not too silly or high fantasy to put any games from the extreme spectrums off.

EDIT: I found that my sweet spot for this game is three players (just like 7 Wonders). More than four makes this less enjoyable for me</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Holy Vlaada ! What an Ameritrash beast, pre-painted miniatures, modular hex-board, scenario based, spells, artefacts, advanced skills. Great Ameritrash game with some Euro mechanics thrown in. It feels and plays great and I cannot wait to try it again, let&#039;s hope further plays prove to be even more exciting than the intro scenario. 

2nd Play: Slightly underwhelmed. The game felt more or less the same and I think there is not enough randomness and excitement in here for a proper Ameritrash game. The game is balanced and Euro-like that it never feels awesome or thrilling but drags along in a stale and calculating pace. Not bad at all, but I am less impressed than I was the first time I tried it. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The game is far from being as vicious as I thought and it is not as much about the voting but anticipating your opponents moves and making sure the Zombies do not get you. Most of the voting in game could only go only so many ways and as such the strategic / alliance options were limited anyway. As such, I did not enjoy the game as much as I though I would and I am not very keen on the artwork which seemed a bit random and generic, would have prepared something darker and more stylized. I think the theme does not work very well, I never felt the creeping onslaught of undead like I do in Last Night on Earth for example. Not a bad game, but at its core, it is a simple placement game and more about calculation than anything else.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Pretty decent family game. Some people will complain about the randomness but it makes the game more animated and fun, instead of being a stale and calculated Euro. This is essentially a betting game (like a horse race) with more betting options, ships that make it to the goal, ships that don&#039;t make it, in which order etc. I did enjoy it but I felt that I had limited control about what was going on most of the time. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The number one game on my must-play (and have) list. Finally I got around to play. I say finally, yet it has only been released for a couple of weeks, but it felt like ages.

I think it is a great experience but like many other themed games, especially the similar Arkham Horror and Betrayal, I found that it depends heavily on who your are playing the game with when it comes to the question of having fun or not.

Luckily, my group was a blast and we managed to steal the victory from poor Mark who had a hard time once we discovered the sinister plan brooding in the mansion filled with maniac hairdressers.

Still, a few things that did not convince me at first play:

A. The puzzles are neat and definitely a nice detour from the common flow of Ameritrash games but I think they generate too much downtime and feel disconnected from the other part of the game.

B. The customization options are too limited

C. In general, the number of available cards in one scenario (as in equipment, events, monsters) is too limited

D. I doubt that this game is highly replayable. I think the designer managed to make it as replayabe as possible considering the storytelling nature of the game but I cannot see this holding up after more than 10 plays (without expansions), which is not my money&#039;s worth

E. The scenario felt a little bit scripted and the choices were limited, especially once the victory conditions had been discovered

Apart from that, awesome stuff

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Light fun game with a great theme, even though it is an abstract puzzler. A tad random with four or more players but that can be part of the fun and make it even more accesible for kids. Some tactics and short term strategy pay off as well as a knack for visual thinking. All in all, a great filler but might frustrate Euro veterans due to the chaos. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Despite the hype, I never found this game amazing, because the player interaction is not very intense. Once the &quot;mastermind&quot; put down the code, all you do is find out by trial and error, which could pretty much be done by a computer as well. No strategy, tactic, bluffing and so forth.

	<numplays>31</numplays>			<comment>Memoir &#039;44 might as well be the best gateway game for wargaming out there. Command cards (unit activation), terrain, scenarios, line of sight etc. many elements of classic wargaming are in there. And yet, the game is just as simple as most Days of Wonder games, if not simpler and it is still tremendous fun. Being a 2-player game, the basic gameplay is very much like an extended (in variety, not in complexity of course) version of chess, take turns in moving your units, fire away and hope for the best. I think the game can appeal to a wide range of gamers (excluding the unnecessarily serious) because of the luck element. To me, it makes the game more dynamic and fun, will I be going to draw the right cards, roll the symbols I need etc. All this and the fact that there are myriads of expansions out there make this an absolute winner.

EDIT: Having played this a few times in a row recently, I still love but sometimes long for something similar of slightly higher complexity (i.e C&amp;C Ancients or Combat Commander) - Maybe I just need an expansion ?

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played it only once and got smashed by the experience player. I am not a big fan of games that have a handful of make n break strategies that will instantly kill everyone else. This feels good but looks atrocious, I have a hard time telling the districts apart etc. Also, the goals are too varied in difficulty, some are just much harder too achieve while not being worth the extra VP at the same time. I found this too be a tad too brainburny but maybe more plays will loosen this up a bit </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Middle Earth Quest really felt like a mixture of Arkham Horror and Fury of Dracula. Take the clue system and call them favours, the encounters and permanent &quot;plots&quot; in play and you have the same race against time and roam around the board feeling as in Arkham Horror. The combat system and hidden monsters popping up all over the board work just like in Fury of Dracula. The game still works and I must admit that despite a weenie lack of innovation it is probably the best that could have been done with a adventure / Ameritrash game set in Middle-Earth. The played cooperation is limited and we rarely discussed tactics as there was usually an obvious choice. While the game is far less random than other adventure games, it feels a bit more non-dynamic and stale. The events and encounters are never crucially intervening, so aren&#039;t the counselors or minions. The endgame in a draw is also oddly anticlimactic, which may very well be most crucial points of my criticism. Of course, as you might expect by a FFG Lord of the Rings game, the artwork, theme, flavour text and so forth is amazing and very enjoyable.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Another game that tries to finally make a deduction game that simulates a murder mystery properly. Did it succeed? Well, it does away with the note taking and adds much more game to the game, but it it will probably still appeal only to people who are inclined to play deduction games in the first place, others (especially lighter gamers) might be put off by the complexity, playing time and difficulty to formulate a strategy. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>To me, the best thing about this game is the theme. I adore the Name of the Rose and this is probalaby as close as you can get to playing a mystery game set in an abbey (apart from the game The Name of the Rose itself of course). But I still think it is only medicore and although it is refreshingly different from your average Euro game (not much different from Cluedo though), there is not enough to it too make it deeply engaging for me. Yes, the way you ask questions and take notes makes a big difference but it is not something I derive joy from while playing. The event cards are interesting and prevent the game from becoming stale, especially with multiple plays. I will have to play it a few more times to see where the rating might go.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Not very keen on the &#039;theme&#039; but the map looks gorgeous. Our game apparently was very unusual and it refused to end, although the excitemnt had been long (long!) gone already. One thing I don&#039;t like about the game is that there is not set limit of turns in the game, so that decision become more meanigful. Sometimes, people just keep going on and on and on, not ending the game and doing the same stuff over and over, hoping to catch up and that is just dull as I don&#039;t feel any progress or dynamic process is still going on in the game once everything is explored and players have settled for a tactic. So, to me, this is a failed design, but that is just me and I can see how some might like it. I am astonished about the lack of chance and randomness in the &#039;game&#039; and people who know me are aware of the fact that a game without chance, is not in game in my definiton.

Not my cup of tea. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I am not a big fan of sci-fi settings in general, be it in movies, books or games. There are no many sci-fi films I like and those I do like are masterpieces and there cannot be an argument regarding their quality really (Alien, 2001, Star Wars etc.). When it comes to games, the same applies. Neuroshima Hex bears a post-apocalyptic sci-fi / mad max earth setting and despite the good execution and love for detail in creating the theme kit does not do anything for me. The game however is great and I like the mixture of puzzling and drawing luck, because a game without random mechanics usually does not appeal. The different &quot;races&quot; or &quot;factions&quot; are diverse enough to make the game interesting over a long course of time, however, I found that those differences, while they are definitely in place, are not that evident and apparent during gameplay which is a shame because it would have been nice for those subtle difference to have a bigger, observable impact on the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>An interesting take on the &#039;Risk&#039; genre. It&#039;s not about defending but clever timing of attacks and managing your troops and money at the same time. The game almost feels like boardgame with some take-that gameplay. However, despite the fact that it looks very tactical and intricate, it does sport a very high degree of randomness, many die rolls and random card powers. The game is short and light-hearted enough that I don&#039;t mind, but it is definitely more at home in the Ameritrash-division than Euro and I might not always be up for so much randomness in my games as the lack of control is really more apparent than in many other games that are similar. The bits and pieces are very nice, it&#039;s a shame that the cards and tiles are ugly, kind of cancels the nice miniatures to a degree. A good game, not for everyone. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Neat bluffing/backstabbing game about mobsters trying to bail out their boss while fighting for survival and the upper hand in the ranks. Played with people in the right mind set, this can be a hilarious blast, negotiations and threats. The game itself is okay and well balanced, considering the randomness. Not sure how replayable the game actually is, but apart from that, a neat game with a good theme. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>It may not look like much, especially if you happen to play with the 3M version ( not sure if there is any other version anyway) but there is a neat game in here. Trick taking with some bluffing and risk involved. Basically, it is a trick taking game with all cards held known by the other players at any point during the game, the question is however, when to play which card, anticipating and your opponents&#039; moves. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Only played it once an we (not we but the rules explainer) got half the rules wrong or forget about them, so playing this felt like holding on to water with your bare hands. Anyhow, I liked the overall structure but I felt that there is not much there but the sum of its parts. Neat Euro mechanics with resource collection, a bit of area control, but again, not enough interaction to make it interesting. Taking over enemy territory is just as expensive for you as it is for the victim (most of the time) so it feels more or less like a bargain than warfare. The endgame feels a bit obscure, is it triggered, is it not triggeres. But hey, there is BOOBS in the game, amazing. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Had the pleasure of being taught by the designer himself. I really did not like Twilight Imperium that much and was worried because some are in the habit of comparing these two games. But I was pleasantly surprised and can now say that I prefer this one by a mile. It is dense and very easy to learn but hard to master (we only played the Introduction game) and there are many decisions to be made. Some of which might be too obvious in the beginning but that may be just the case in the beginner game. You usually have on less action than you need and that is the hallmark of a nice design. I like the multiple paths to victory (points) and I managed to do fine just by building so many monuments early in the game and refrain from a warfaring strategy (also because I stood no chance against Nigel anyway).

I would love to try to advanced game because of the various alien races, the secret action selection and new sector types.

I can only second Paul&#039;s outrage, why is this not getting published ? </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Is this similar to Ticket to Ride ? I don&#039;t know, but this one is fun, way simpler than it looks, although it takes a good hour to figure out the distances between the stations and other finer details of the gameboard (/w pieces). A basic track-laying game it is refreshingly unlayered. No player hands or event cards etc. Personally, I would prefer a bit more random elements, some events, the chance to be nasty with your fellow players (track breakdowns, power failures etc.), but I suppose that wuld throw the Euro-Appeal. London is always a nice theme (Hometown, Baby!), so that is a plus for me.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A nice strategy/economy game with an unsual theme. Instead of goods or stocks, people buy pieces of music and raise or lower the worth (fame) of composers. The best thing about Opera is the budget system which determines the turn order and thus the roles played by each player. While this might look like a small part of the game it is essentially the heart of the game and what makes it stand out from the crowd. For my taste, the game requires too much planning ahead and once you are behind there is a slim chance you can catch up. It is purely skill/strategy based. A few more luck/random factors could have done the game good. Still, the theme and interesting turn order resolution make this a one worth checking out. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I do much prefer &#039;case&#039; based games in deduction games than games where you pretty much have to hunt down a random bit of information that is missing from the game by finding all the others (Clue, Mystery of the Abbey, Mystery Express etc.). One of my favourites is 221b Baker Street and Orient Express definitely looks like a step up from that. I have played two cases and I found the cases to be a bit tedious and dull and more about numbers than creative thinking. I prefer cases in which the mystery lies behind a seemingly inexplicable crime scene instead of who sat for dinner with whom for who long. I have always been more fond of Conan Doyle than Christie so that is probably why. Anyhow, the game is okay, but I cannot say I enjoyed it a lot when I played it due to the nature of the cases. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A simple version of the basic Civilization premise. Players will populate, move around and fight within Europe in order to score points for establishing countries and having the majorities in the regions, on sea and in general. The game is an area-control game at its core, slightly spiced up by the (slighlty rough) combat mechanics and card system. The theme is not bad, although it does only hold up for about 20 minutes. The game is a tad underwhelming with three players and people who played it before will usually annihilate others. Once you are behind, there is little you can do to go for the top spot again which is something I never like in games. The endstage of the game might be a bit too confusing for some, I know it was for me, with the overloaded board too many countries and tokens to keep track of. Still, I would play this game again, especially with the right people.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>A decent card game with one interesting and unusual mechanic and that is that the colour of the card you play determines who takes the next turn, which has an unique but quite tactical feel to it. The special powers of the characters remind of of Citadels, which is not a bad thing. It is a bit unfortunate that the game is in German and despite featuring English writings on the reference sheets, it takes a while to get used to it. Furthermore, I a have yet to find out how strategic or luck based this game actually is, but for now, it is a solid filler and I suspect there is potential for the rating to increase with more plays.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Bought the game at Leisure Games. The mechanics and flow of the game are well thought out.Unfortunately, I had to rate this down because after playing it with different groups, I must admit that this heavily relies on the right people. Pandemic is very cooperative and there are not many mechanic-related interactions available, so all the discussing, negotiation, planning etc. is voluntary and if people don&#039;t go for it, the game feels pointless. I had players sitting around not &quot;getting&quot; the game because they refused to interact with other players, which renders your own options useless. Still, with the right people, good game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>God knows I do love my traitor games and while this is not the innovative and revolutionary game some people thought it might be, it is a solid entry in the genre. The rules are terrible, counter-intuitive and have not been proofread, but the gameplay is still good and fun so don&#039;t let that deter you and look our for some good reference sheets and rules on the geek. Only played this once so cannot really say how much is strategy and how much is just randomness and luck, I felt there was a lack of control over some elements but maybe that is just because I never played it before. Good one. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A very good, medium-heavy Euro. I do like the theme, although it is not implemented to a degree I would have prepared it to be. The idea that the players are not playing one civilization each, but rather control the same civilization together, trying to score VPs is intriguing and reminds me of Britannia. Unfortunately, apart from different starting positions and one unique event, all the cultures are the same and I would have wished for more variety, different gods and more historical tie-ins. 

I found that there are a lot of things you can do wrong in this game. Things that can effectively cripple you. When you build too many columns too soon, run out of cards or end up with a bad god combo, you are out of luck.

The column scoring does not make sense to me either, why give someone who is already reeking in more points due to having the most columns give the multiplier too ? This created a runaway leader in our game and I am not sure why that is necessary

That being said, all those games do not change the fact that the game is good fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>More of the same but very well executed civilization building game. Build tiles, lay them onto your playing field, gather resources, continue from step 1 for 9 nine rounds. Works very nice and the bidding mechanic is neat because once you bid you cannot increase the bid, only change where it goes, quite ingenious I might say. Good balance and the disasters add more flavour, so do the sea tiles from the expansion. I found the building rules (you can use them even if unbuild) very confusing and I think they should have changed that during playtesting. One of my favourite Euros (after 1 play that is)</comment>				</item>

It is interesting for trivia buffs, but it does lack the communication to make it a really good game and it also works only with 2 or 4 players IMHO, more is just too much. Getting closer to the answers sometimes just ends up in a long run of trial and error which is not really what this game is (or should be) about but what can you do. Still, should be high on the list for couples that happen to be fans of trivia games. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I do prefer RA over Phoenicia. I found the game a bit too fiddly and the theme way too inconsistent, the player interaction is not as tight as in other auction games I have player. Furthermore, the advantage of the leading player(s) is heavily unbalanced and however goes first controls the auction, has the most money and so forth. Also, I found the game tends to become interesting only in the last two rounds. I would play it again, but it is just more of the same with a weak theme and not enough polish.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I do like this game and the card-grid action selection system but I am terribly annoyed by the starting player mechanic, not only because I was on the receiving end of the crapstick, but I just made a game that should be all about subtle and fine decisions way to imbalanced. The contested cards should be decided by a Euro-mechanic, such as secret bidding and not through sheer chance and luck. That can be very frustrating for both players because even If I would win the game, I&#039;d rather not win it by chance and disadvantages on the side of my opponent. The theme is neat, but more or less just an excuse for sophisticated artwork which is fair and square in my book and If you like World Without End (or Pillars of the Earth) you will enjoy this game. Not as deep and engaging as its namesakes but then again, it plays quicker and is easy to carry. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A neat party game that uses the classic formula of draw-to-guess but limits your creativity by forcing you to use pixels on a magnetic board instead of pens or clay etc. While this may sound as same-old same-old, it actually works quite well because coming up with pixelated representations of thinks like &quot;Wolf&quot; ain&#039;t as easy as it sounds. The idea of rewarding the players that use less pixels than others is also quite clever. Good laugh ! </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Planet Steam
This game: All plays | User plays
It is ironic how I have been known to complain about the lack of theme and fancy schmonsens in eurogames and here comes a game that sports a wagon car full of bits, a board the size of a small country and so much theme and artwork, it feels almost like an Ameritrash game.

But the core game mechanic is the market and the placement rules and the co-relation between production and selling of goods.

That being said, in this case, I am not sure all the bling and theme add much too the came and make the more interesting than it actually is. Sure, farming steam on a remote planet is exciting but most of it comes down to number crunching after all, no matter how creepy that worker looks or how futuristic the &#039;tank&#039; might have been designed.

I feel like the designers went all out on making this a lavish production but this reminds me of the idiom that more is not necessarily better and in this case, I would have prefered a slimmed down and minimalist version of the same game.

The market is an interesting idea and remindes me of an old 3M game, Executive decision but it comes with a lot of baggage of which 70 % is just that.

Not a bad game but I feel it does not live up to its reputation of being an holy grail game and I have played much shorter and simpler games that still have a better flow and more rewarding gameplay. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>From a glimpse of the board, one can tell that Portobello Market&#039;s prototype used to be a traingame. It looks exactly like the Ticket to Ride board. That being said, I never played Ticket to Ride and as such, Portobello Road has a lot to offer to me. A solid Euro and light brain teaser, with only very limited luck. The theme is lovely and so are the pieces. The two player game is more of a brain teaser, more focused and tight while playing with more players, especially four becomes more frantic and chaotic, in a good way. Still, the game is missing the big WOW factor and while being a solid and entertaining game, it will probably not see much play to many better games being around.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An okay game, I found it way too long, especially towards the end when it comes down to number crunching and you pretty much loose touch with what is going on around you, at least I did. I does not help that the theme ins painfully dull and boring. Still, one of the better Euros out there. I cannot help but think that the game will play pretty similar every time as the natural balance of progression in this game is pretty linear and you will never have many tactical options and usually one obvious strategy to go for in each round and that is something I find rather uninteresting. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Many people despise me for that philosophy but happily state it again. I like my euros simple and my ameritrash complex. This falls right into the wrong puddle of mud. Way too complex and dry for my taste. There is also not enough interaction. I am not saying there is none, but the game did not facilitate the kind of discussions and planning or banter I would expect from game that attempts to emulate the ongoings in a company like this. Id rather struggle with decisions because the strategic implications are hard to figure out instead of the mechanics itself. Not my cup of tea.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I am not a big fan of Dominion, because it is really a solitaire game played by multiple players at once. Puzzle Strike tries to cash in on the hype and create a hybrid of a flash-game (think Puzzle Quest / Tetris) and Dominion. It might appeal to you if you are into Dominion and are looking for something new and slightly (only slightly) different, but if you, like, loath Dominion then this is not for you.</comment>				</item>

The theme (like in all Knizia games) is very generic and does not add or take anything to the experience. Played it with a particular nice group who were very into it, must try it with other groups as well and see how it plays.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The prospect of yet another &quot;deck&quot;-builder game had me grinding my teeth. I hate Dominion with a passion and the similarities seemed rather obvious, but here I am, admitting that I did enjoy RFTG after all. Of course, like Dominion, it lacks the player interaction of so many games which came out recently (Dominion, Dungeon Lords) and is more or less a mulit-solitaire game. In a 2-player game, it is quite fun to see what your opponent is up to, but am really doubtful whether I will be able and willing to follow the respective progresses of four players at all. The artwork is great so is the flexibility of the deck.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>An intriguing game which has quite a lot of visual appeal despite the thin theme. The game play is a tad dry unpolished (The reference sheet has an &quot;Action 8&quot; which is &quot;not to take an action&quot;), but becomes more intriguing as you go along. I found a bit too much going on for my taste and it is real feat of concentration to keep track of all the factors that are playing into the final score, lots of mental bookkeeping, which is not a bad thing if that is what you are into, but it is easy to loose track and trail behind if you do not pay attention all the time. I understand that this is the whole point of the game but my point is that it might not be for everyone and it feels like a competitive puzzle/sandbox game with all of the dynamics being the other players (mostly). Still, a good game and if played within a group of balanced playing strength it is quiet satisfying. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>17</numplays>			<comment>Just to get it out of the way, while this shares the same basic premise as the core game of BSG, I think there is no way this delivers the same experience as BSG. The decisions in The Resistance are not as intricate and delicate and sometimes, even though you are a human, you will still struggle to make the &#039;right&#039; decision, which adds nicely to the overall atmosphere of paranoia. The Resistance resembles the bare-bone calculation of BSG&#039;s skill checks and the traitor discussions which result thereof but in terms of depth, atmosphere and intensity, this cannot compete with the grand daddy of all traitor games. Still, a neat little game. 

EDIT: Only good without the plot cards and with 5 or 6 players, not more.

EDIT2: I still like this game because of the meta-game but I feel that it is just too hard (too random) to spot the spies, unlike BSG where you have lots (lots!) of time and occurrences that promote the exposure of the traitors. Most of the time, the spies won the game just out of pure chance (4 people on a mission with 6 players, how can you exclude the two spies unless you know exactly who they are ? Not gonna happen)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting area control game. It could do with a longer playing time as we just started to get going with all the mergers of Duchies and such but maybe they tried to keep the confrontational level down. Now that I played it once I want to try it again and improve my strategy which is the hallmark of a good game, makes me want to come back. The board is not the easiest to make out but then again, at least they did not make it too abstract. Like the &#039;theme&#039;, that is, the setting (I used to live next to the Rhine). Another solid Knizia. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>What I like about this game is that the randomness and luck factor is immense, yet it is still caused by tangible elements which are the other players. So whatever happens and no matter how much chaos is caused, it is not down to that untouchable mechanic but what the other programmers do. Thus, the randomness does not feel frustrating but rewarding if anything. On the other hand, I did struggle with the complex map a bit and while I do not mind being annihilated and outsmarted by oppenents, I found it a bit annoying that I had so many oversights and lapses. Of course, I see how this is the point of being a good gamer, but it feels to brainy and puzzle-like for me. Still a nice one.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>It sure looks pretty but for that price, all you get is a very sophisticated Yahtzee clone (albeit better than King of Tokyo). The interaction is limited and there is not much you can do to hinder, let alone attack opponents. Sure, some of you dice rolls might result in minus points for your opponents, but the problem is that you would never make a strategic decision to do so but rather accept that fact if you should happen to roll the dice that cause minus points for you enemies and as such, it is as random as the rest of the game. At least, there are two levels of strategy, push-your-luck when rolling the dice and some decision make as to where to allocate the workers/money. An okay Yahtzee clone that is not interactive enough to make it shine. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Cannot say I liked this one. A very try and bland worker placement game and pretty much a blend of Louis XIV and Fresco, two great contenders for the JASE-Award of the year. The game is not broken or horrible, it is just uninspired and boring, not enough interaction and the theme does not work for me (whatever there is left of it). </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A super-light but surprisingly fun little filler game that is not as superficial as it looks (and sounds) on first glance. Great if you have 5 minutes to fill and want to play something that is both chaotic and random but gives players choices to make still. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Designer Denys Lonshakov brought the prototype of his game Ruthenia. Although it is not my type of game, I though it was not bad, alas not innovative enough to stand out from similar games. Factions in Eastern Europe battle it out for territories and the respective victory points. The flow of the game is pretty traditional, move units, buy units, build improvements (markets, forts, ships etc.) and go to war. The battles are resolved via cards representing units, with actual formations and extra event cards played on top of it. Unfortunately, I found that the &quot;fighting&quot; is not as much fun as it is time consuming and I&#039;d rather play a game which emulates the tension of a battle instead of simulating the process. Still, with a 90 minute playing time, some randomness (rebel uprisings, free factions etc.) and the ability to backstab a bit will probably appeal to genre enthusiasts. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I admit, I am a bit spoiled when it comes to games involving a traitor, as I had the pleasure of being introduced to the mechanic through the brillian BSG. However, the prospect of a light filler/opener game including a traitor (Saboteur) intrigued me. The game plays simple and fast, as expected but the traitor mechanic is not very slick. Being the traitor and staying undetected is almost impossible and the &quot;suspence&quot; and &quot;accusing&quot; usually stops after a few turns, once it is settled who the traitor is, what follows is just a game of luck, because however holds the right cards, wins, all tactics and strategy is pretty much thrown overboard ( not that there was awfully much in the first place, but at least the traitor is thinking about how to remain undiscovered). We had fun, but it must be said that my gamegroup us very lively and as such we threw around quite a few accusations, but with the &quot;wrong&quot; kind of people, the gameplay can be rather stale. Again, a nice filler which is good in the face of a lacking alternative, but other than that, the novelty wears flat rather quickly.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Now I see where 7 Wonders took half of its inspiration from. A very basic and streamlined Card-Euro / Efficiency engine game with a terrible theme and artwork. It does not play very elegant and will probably be solved after half a dozen plays, there is just not enough variety in the cards to make this epic or engaging enough. And being a simple game like that, there is just not enough excitement, speed or luck in the game. 

EDIT: Played it again, and it&#039;s not all that bad just outdated and ugly as hell. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Like I said on a hundred other occasions before, I am not a fan, that is, I dislike efficiency engine games, especially if they lack any or much player interaction (I like Kingsburg!). San Juan is another example of everybody doing his own things, just like in Dominion or RFTG. Very limited interaction and usually, at one point, players lose track and interest in what the others are building. Another multi-solitaire game, unninovative and bland. HX</comment>				</item>

This is the perfect example why I prefer uni-board games to multi-solitaire games. Despite being galaxies simpler than Agricola or Puerto Rico, this game is much more interactive and clever, forcing the players to consider their opponents moves and eventually bribing them to help them out. Very simple, very clever. HX</comment>				</item>

Not much of a game in here in terms of mechanic but a simple idea that brings people together around a table and makes them laugh with each other. </comment>				</item>

The mechanics are deceptively simple, but the game does faciliate a lot of communication between the players and that is what makes the game fun, that is, only if you play with the right people of course.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An unusual little game, that is actually more of a brain exercise. It is quite interesting but I would not go as far as calling it fun really and there is not a lot of game in there neither. I would have preferred some more hands-on mechanics, turns, time limits, etc., instead of a free-for-all shouting out kind of thing, which might excite some people but it just stresses me out. Also, being good as this game is mostly a question of repetition and pattern recognition and if you cannot afford to have lot of the former and suck at the latter, you are doomed.</comment>				</item>

This game is lots of fun, has interesting decisions for you to make without ever feeling to fiddly or AP-prone. The theme is brilliant and generates lots of laughs. Another plus is the playing time,you can fit in 2 or 3 games in 90 minutes which is great. Also like the advanced rules, random teams or team auctions. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Quite an intriguing premise (although the artwork is horrible) but I feel that most of the game is just too random and there are not a lot of decisions to be made. The dice rolling dictates where you have to go most of the time and depending on what you get (or don&#039;t), you can try to find out who is on your side (or not). Once that is done, the rest is just dice rolling and hoping for the best. The theme is okay, but like so many Japanese/Asian-flavoured fantasy games, just a butchered copy of Western mythology paired with cutie pies. There are much better traitor games out there, and much better games in general. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>Awesome cooperative/traitor game. I love the theme and I think it works well with the game. There is no downtime, considering this plays with up t 8 players. I am yet to play the expansion and reckon this might climb up to a 10. One thing I am not sure of is to what extent the traitor can do stuff to influence the game apart from remaining hidden, as compared to BSG for example. There is always one more thing to do than you can and the game is both exciting and tense. I like it.

EDIT: Played it four times in a short time now and while I still think this does not deserve to sit in the back of gamers&#039; shelves just because of BSG, it does not hold up all too well after multiple plays within a short period of time. The traitor&#039;s options are too limited and so are the knights, in my opinion. Also, the game is too easy to win (Yes, I would like to try the expansion). </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>This adds some interesting stuff without changing the game completely or making it too heavy and complex for newbies. The Merlin/Travel mechanic is neat and so are the extra white cards. I will probably never (or rarely) play it with seven or eight players of I am not sure the 2nd traitor card will ever see the light of day, unless you play the hard variant with 2 (possible) traitors in a 5/6 player game. More of the same, solid, if not ingenious, expansion. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A very interesting &#039;game&#039; concept to which the word game can only be applied on a very loose basis. It is more of a collaborative narrative whodunnit experience with lots of clues and deducing. I think it is the most fun if played cooperatively and pondering about who the culprit might be. Sometimes the clue matrix does not really work and there are no clues where there should be clues (in my opinion) and i would not have minded a few more red herrings for good measure, just to make the city of London feel more dynamic and alive with people bustling all over the place. Anyway, interesting game and one of the rare occasions where the theme is perfectly captured in a game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>There is just too much randomness in this game to make it interesting, it is more or less an awareness game than about planning ahead and strategy. You might call it slightly tactical at best, but due to the constant change of your pieces movement range, you have to adapt your plan each turn. It is like chess on speed but not as much fun as it sounds because people will quickly just go from planning and pondering to hoping for the best. Not my cup of tea.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Interesting game which I played for the first time recently as many non-casual gamers fear it like the vampire fears the cross, I am not sure why. The game and the fun you have while playing it depends on who you are playing it with, some people enjoy the fierce competition and trying to blockade each other, refuse trading etc., others may find it too vicious. The random element is a nice idea, also experienced players have a big advantage. Another flaw in my opinion is the accumulative nature of successes, the more resources you have, the more you can build and the more you build the more resources you have, which can be a pain in the ass should the starting conditions be unbalanced because that will be hard to flatten out later in the game. Still, a neat little game which could have done with some better artwork and theme instead of the plaster-on. I reckon that the expansions add a lot to it but I am not sure whether Ill ever be able to give those a go, considering the general reluctance of geeks to play it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>A simple card game which is more luck-driven than anything else. The best thing to do is to avoid mistakes but apart from that there is not much strategy involved, maybe blocking other players to some extent but that is about it. Not bad for ten minutes but becomes boring and stale very quickly.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I think the basic idea behind this is good. The drafting and then the card game, but some mechanics make this too random and less strategic as it could have been. There should be more team building and less random swapping and then the game would be really interesting. Great artwork and geek references though.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>45</numplays>			<comment>The perfect mix of randomness and strategy/skill. Simple rules but very flexible and thus extremely tweakable and expendable, a thing I like about games. The idea of having different boards for different player numbers is a bit odd but works quite well. The theme is funny and quirky and although I do prefer high-fantasy settings, Smallworld&#039;s theme fits the concept far better.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>The expansion makes the definitely more enjoyable and finally an expansion (the third one!) which actually alters some gameplay, i.e. adds something new to it, not just more of the same. Like the other expansions, the packaging etc. is a tad underwhelming and one asks himself how anything exciting can be hidden within that deck of cards. Well there is, lots of random events, cute artwork and lots of new variety injected into the game. However, I would have preferred some more madness and randomness. Many of the cards are very straightforward and only slight alterations, Woods score and extra point, mountains can not be conquered etc. While others really cause some mayhem (like adding a second skill to your races, cool). Of course you can adjust the game (rules included) to emphasis on the more critical events, but why not make the expansion have more impact in the first place. I would also have preferred a few new tokes with the events, but it looks like Smallworld is only the fosterchild of Days of Wonder (unlike Ticket to Ride). Still, for fans and friends of Smallworld, this is a must. 

EDIT: The only way I can play small world and still enjoy it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A chaotic card game, similar to Small World in terms of combinable player powers (i.e. shuffle to types of creatures together and go for it), but features more direct conflict and lots (!) more exceptions to the relaitvely simple rules. All the possible combinations of races make for great replayability but it might take some time for players to learn the races&#039; advantages by heart and play towards their respective strength. On the other hand, the thematic aspect of the game is a great laugh and I for one love the idea of Dinosaur-Ninjas facing off against Undead-Russians (riding bears). Not sure how balanced all the race combinations are and a lot depends on card draws, then again, the game I played felt very balanced. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>If you are used to the ingenious simplicity of Ave Caesar, all other racing games have to stand up to the test of the Roman chariot racing game. Snow Tails is one of the few racing games that I enjoyed. It takes a few turns to get your head around the rules but once things begin to slide, it is all in good fun. However, I am not sure how much long-term strategy there is to the game as you can only really see your next two or three hands but I suppose that is what you want in a racing game, more feverish thrill than dull planning ahead. The board and general artwork look amazing, a shame the sleighs look a bit dull. Good racing game, will probably go up in my estimation after more plays. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Apart from the superfrenzy created by the real-time aspect of the game, the core game is still a basic coopeative puzzler. I did enjoy it but was both underwhelmed by the strategic possibilites and the non-thematic experience and overwhelmed by the diffictulty of communicating with your fellow players. I have only played a basic (training) version of the game and maybe I will need to explore it more and play with right people as well, but for now, this is a mixed bag for me and I would rather play a similar game (puzzler like Ghost Stories or Space disaster like BSG) but indulge in what the game generates in atmosphere and tension instead of rushing though it like that.

EDIT: Played this with the &#039;right&#039; group of people, finally, a few of my close friends and really enjoyed it this time. I think this is a great game if you have good group and are interested in playing though all the missions.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>In the aftermath of my HeroQuest addiction, I bought many &quot;Dungeon&quot; crawler games a la Space Crusade. The game appealed to my friends more than hero quest, because of the gritty sci-fi theme. Although I do prefer HeroQuest, Space Crusade is a nice game and can be quite thrilling when you play it with the right people.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>What a treat for an Ameritrash-gamer. Amazing tiles and minaiture, plus exciting and thrilling scenarios that pit the crazy marines against the feverish genestealers coming from all corners. Played with the right people and atmosphere, this game would creep the shingles out of me. The rules are simple enough with a few exceptions and fiddly rules you need to remember but the flow of the game is great. The timed turn for the marines both prevents AP and makes the game more exciting. Love it, it is a shame it is so hard to track down. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Not keen on the W40K Universe in the first place. I found the game too fiddly and all the setting up throughout the game takes longer than the actual playing time. The game is deceiptively simple, despite all the different actions on the cards and comes down to two die rolls. Not my cup of tea. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Quite an abstract game and I think it might be quite rewarding to become better and better (preferably with the same opponent) to really enjoy the ingeniuty of subtleties such as starting set-up and moving your ships around. Then again, at this point, it just feels a tad random and uninspired, due to the fact that the game mechanics itself are rather dull. The theme is non-existent (this is an abstract, no less) but the board and bits still look good so that is a plus and it might even attract the attention of young gamers and families due to its presentation. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I am not sure if we played this right but I found this game a bit too chaotic and all-over-the-place. The theme is interesting but I did not like it. It is a train game after all and why not stick to the train theme and make it all goofy and crazy, unless you really make it a game that is considerably different from all other train games.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>This game is more or less carried by one single, albeit clever mechanic. And what is wrong with making that one special mechanic the axis and focal point of the game ? I actually like Speicherstadt&#039;s minimalist and purist approach and apart from the odd &#039;fire&#039; concept that might have been a leftover from a previously more sophisticated design, the game relies solely one a few nitty-gritty rules and mechanics. The theme is almost non-existent but the bits are nice, the money and the artwork on the cards. A solid variation of the bidding/collection genre. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting 2-player light-wargame. The core of the game is capturing planets, moving your ships around, combat and maybe repairing or replacing the odd ship. However, what makes the game interesting are the special power cards that grant you abilities that can make the whole game experience different. It might be the ability to beam ships around the board, blow ships up in suicide missions, repair ships for free etc. This makes for some great replayability, let alone the four scenarios that come with the game. I liked this game a lot. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played this only once and was both disappointed and slightly overwhelmed by all the number-crunching, doublechecking of skills and so forth. Maybe I am old school and I understand that this is an &#039;Expedition&#039; game but a Star Trek game that is not set on the Enterprise ? That just feels wrong and not thematic at all. The production value of this game is good, although the pieces sacrifice usability for style and some of the numbers in the Clix-figures and ships are really hard to see. There is some thematic mambo-jambo on the cards but those are just placeholders and I have rarely seen a thematic game with less theme or story or flavour for that matter behind it. We did not care for it and why would you. The only thing that matters in this game is numbers and colours you have to match and then roll a few dice here and there (Knizia anyone?). If this would not have this great license, I think people would not enjoy it as much, I know I would not. Oddly enough, I found this to inelegantly designed and shallow at the same time. Not my cup of tea. Also, replayability is not very high.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>An interesting race against time kind of game (in this case, against the ever-looming presence of Lord Vader). You try feverishly to shake off the stormtroopers while making your way across the map towards the exit and Millenium Falcon (but not before switching off the tractor beam). A lot in this game comes down to die rolls and card draws, some limited decisions have to be made regarding risk taking ( on risk cards ), which character to send into the fray and when to use special ability boosting points from Droids and Obi Wan. It feels like a typical cooperative game of players vs. degrees of randomness. The theme makes this quite enjoyable, it is Star Wars after all, even though the components are not that good. I soloed this and will try it with other people to see whether the theme and excitment of replaying the Death Star Escape increases. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Only played the basic game with three players but enjoyed it more than Age of Steam, but only slightly. I think the game is neat but there is not enough luck involved for my taste and it is more or less a brain burning puzzle game and the eggheads will usually just solve the board and beat you to it. Also, towards the end (the last few rounds), the games becomes less about expansion than about repeatedly running the already efficient machine which I found a bit stalling. Still, neat game and I would play again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I enjoyed this game very much and only played the basic game. A super-involved, dynamic and tense 2-player duel. It is great how different the sides play (as compared to most other 2-player games) and with the random setup,the game is quite random in its setup (apart from card draws etc.). Am really impressed by the design, although the rulebook is terrible (and the million reference sheets available are not much of a help either). Apart from that, great game and a candidate for a 10 (depending on how the advanced game plays)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A great civilization variant with a handful of key mechanics which makes this stand out from the average bulk of civ games. The bidding for alliances bid is an amazing mechanic and really what this whole game is about. Of course, apart from the official alliances, there is no limited as to how many spoken agreement can be made and broken, lots of backstabbing and negotiation going on. I have played it only once but found that some players overreact whenever you become to vicious, despite the fact that the game and theme calls for being ruthless, so be careful who you play with, this is a sure-fire temper riser. The initial setup adds some randomness which makes this game way more re-playable than other civ games. It takes a while to learn all the available upgrades and such by heart but once you manage to, the game is actually very simple. The board and card artwork could do with an overhaul, both in style as well as usability but that is a minor issue. All in all, an above than average civ game which should be your holy grail if you are really into the subject matter. It is not my preferred theme and as I said, I am usually a nasty player and like to be vicious and cruel when playing games which call for it and found that many geeks cannot take it because to them, gaming is everything and they cannot lose. Great game. HX</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I did not enjoy Sumeria, the theme is awfully generic and the game is pretty much an abstract area control game with bizarre and frustrating rules for starting player which are almost random and can be very annoying and there the control over what is going on in the game is too limited with four players, because you can never really predict what other people will be doing. Too dry and too clunky for me. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>A very simple and slick Knizia game and maybe one of his best. The game plays and feels nice, solid pieces and nice dice. There is enough dice rolling to make it random and enough push-your-luck elements to make it tactical. Great travel game.

EDIT: Played it again and found it a bit less exciting due to the limited player interaction. Maybe it was just bad luck but the chopsticks seem to come up at such a rare rate that the game is dominated by doing your own thing instead of caring what the others do too much</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A games that only makes sense once you start playing it and even then probably not earlier halfway through. The game is essentially a card-game with some bluffing and hand management beefed up with some placement and tile collection (yes, it is a Knizia). However, in this case, I found that there is less skill involved than in many other Knizia games and a lot comes down to luck in this game (That is, if you consider random actions by other players luck). It might be something you are used to when playing a Knizia game, but this one is particularly ugly and the &#039;theme&#039; or visuals add nothing to the enjoyment of the game, let alone making easier to play. The cards are really confusing. Why show two elephants on the card when it is worth one ? I thought this was okay. A typical Knizia that is missing that certain something that most of his other games have.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Definitely a step-up from 6 nimmt ! This game is a bit more complex and the fact that it comes with plus AND minus points should be enough to tell you that this is not as easy a game to learn and play as 6 nimmt. However, that probably only applies if you are playing with 2 or 3 players, because just like 6 nimmt!, if you player with too many players, all derails into chaos (not a bad thing necessarily) but it might make the game a completely different experience than it should be. For a &#039;card game&#039; if found this too complex and puzzle-like.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A neat racing game that reminds me of Heimlich &amp; Co. The artwork and pieces are really cute. Even though the tile-based gameboard is a tad fiddly. Then again, that makes it easier to fit it in the &quot;Book&quot; box. There is not a lot of strategy here when it comes to the hidden bets, due to the fact that it becomes very obvious early on, which player chose which animal to support / bet on. I wish there would be a bit more depth there. On the other hand, that might have made the game less family friendy.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Most definitely an unusual concept for a &#039;game&#039;. Pretty much a collective storytelling experience which makes an effort to maintain the illusion of the presence of decision making. An interesting game, a tad too random and unfathomable maybe. I am not sure how it would hold up after multiple plays but that remains to be seen.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I love randomness so this game is lots of fun, it feels more like a weird racing game than a crawler but the competitive aspect makes it fun, fighting and chasing other players. The most annoying thing is the movement mechanic and the board which can be quite hard to read depending on where you are sitting. The characters are very diverse (and many) which is amazing, sadly the diversity does not carry over to the enemies and items you can find, alas, I would have prefered more items to cause the game to go topsyturvy but I guess that would have thrown too many people of. Still, with the right people that can have a laugh, this game is fun.</comment>				</item>

The idea of having different endings is the best thing about this expansion and adds to the chaotic randomness of Talisman.

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>Right off the bat I can say that I adore the bits &amp; pieces of this game, nice artwork, sturdy tiles and cute little buildings, great. The game itself is a Carcassonne plus 3D plus Puzzle variant which is more intricate than it looks. I have played it once and was overwhelmed at first and intrigued later. I reckon that the game becomes more cutthroat and interactive the more experienced the players become and start minding not only their own business. A good game with a slightly confusing final scoring system but other than that, thumbs up, this is subject to increase in rating once I get my head around it. </comment>				</item>

The map looks gorgeous and the flow of the game is very tight and interactive. It would have been nice if there would be a stronger meta-game promoted by the game (mechanics) but this is nonetheless a very unique game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>A good card game which keeps a nice flow going which might be due to the fact that it feels very much like a traditional card-game which clearly seems to have been the intention. Simple rules, flexibility in the decks and high re-playability as well as multiple ways of going about winning make this a very slick and enjoyable game. HX</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Not a bad game by any account, but considering this is one of the most popular gateway games I did expect more of an intriguingly designed game with some irresistible finesse, a la Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne, two games which are simple, yet ingenious. But Ticket to Ride is more or less nothing but the collection of coloured cards and playing this cards as soon as you accumulated the target number (the higher the better). Throw in the whole kerfuffle about train routes and the ability to &#039;block&#039; other players and you have yourself a boardgame. It works alright and is not bad but I feel that the game is not more than the sum of its parts and it does not click with me. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The theme is rather dry, like with most Knizia games. It is more or less a competitive puzzle game which I do not really like, not enough luck involved and the programmers always win. Also, I think the flow of the game is too heavy and a few less rules would have done the game good, the weight is just too heavy for that kind of game, and I would either play something more elegant or something more themed.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Finally played this game and it was as good as I expected. It does not matter that much whether you know all the titles, in fact, seeing someone describing something or miming a title he never heard about can be a tearjerker, because people only have the words in the title to work with. It was surprise how the scaling down of available options in portraying the clue works, because all players see all clues eventually and you can figure the answer out just because you know which cards are in play. Fantastic party game, A must-have.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I think Last Night on Earth and Invasion from Outer Space are good games and their simple and fast playing style suits them well. Lots of dice rolling, movement (grid system), lots of card-plays, light skirmish gaming. A Touch of Evil however walks down a different path and it does not work in my opinion. The game is essentially a very thematic (ameritrash) game but there is not enough theme in it too make it work. If you compare this to Arkham Horror, it feels like going to a country fair when you could go to Disneyland. The rules are fiddly and inelegant, sometimes nothing exciting happens and there is no atmosphere at all. Disappointing. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Pretty much the same game as Transamerica. I do enjoy this game also I would recommend playing it with the Vexation extension as it might be seriously underwhelming otherwise. The European map is a wee more chaotic and harder in my opinion, although some argue about this point. The basic premise is a simple as it gets and the game is after all very luck based if you have evenly skiller players which might put more serious gamers off. Not much of a theme either. I do enjoy it however, if only for the short time it takes to play and pick up. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Another train game. I found it quite fun for a filler, although it is way too solvable, especially for experienced players, there is always a &quot;best&quot; way to go , you only have to know which, but once you do, the game plays very linear and stagnant. The theme is very thin and I have seen train games which encompass the homely &quot;feeling&quot; of trains and tracks way better. A few more random elements, turn options and abilities to influence other players&#039; moves and decision.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Played the Traumfabrik version and was surprised how simple this game actually is. At its heart, it is nothing but a tile collecting game with an auction mechanic. Yet, theme theme makes it more exciting than your average farmer fare. I still think the game could have done with a bit more interaction but I suppose with more plays, the players will start looking out for each others&#039; productions to be to a higher extent, hoping to grab the film awards first and ending up with the best film in the respective genres. Definitely a little gem when played with film fans. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is not a game, it is a torture device. Running around the board is incredibly tedious, especially with &quot;roll again&quot; fields, some turns are just that, roll and roll and roll the dice, so boring it makes me dizzy. The question are just trivia, unimaginative and boring, either you not or you don&#039;t, where is the game in that ? HX</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I can honestly see where this game is coming from. The first dice allocation game I played was Kingsburg which is probably the most simple of the bunch. I played Alien Frontiers and did not like the theme and found it a tad more complex than the former. Troyes however is the behemoth of the trio and takes the dice allocation mechanic and beefs it up with lots of stuff, rules and tweaks. If you are a fan of the genre, that is, someone who looks for more of the same in a heavier context, Troyes is the go-to game for you. However, I still prefer Kingsburg because the game keeps it simple, focuses more on interaction instead of calculations and brainburning. Troyes takes it one level to far (for me) but I can see why some people might really like it. I am not keen on the fact that you get an advantage by learning the cards by heart either, I do not like that, I want my games to be decided by skill, not by sheer investment of time into preparing for it beforehand. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Another example that a good critic does not make a good author. Tulipmania is incredibly boring and brainy, pretty much like playing pong on a calculator. There is number crunching without the excitment of a stock market and is incredibly easy to &quot;solve&quot; the game and use the right tactics as they options to influence/sabotage the other players are way too limited to make a game in which the players are so interdependant interesting. Take a horrible theme and terrible artwork and you have yourself a crappy game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A great way to describe this (and I am paraphrasing John B. here) is that this actually feels like a racing game. No betting, waging, secret movement or shooting rockets at others but speed, anticipation of others&#039; movements, risk and a bit of luck/momentum. The artwork is not that good and the game lacks the gritty atmosphere of Win,Place and Show but this is a very good racing game. Definitely best with the fences. </comment>				</item>

Neat and complicated mechanics but stale and rather static gameplay. I was never really excited while playing this but felt like carefully executing a fine plan without the spirit of adventure and chaos you would expect from a game of interstellar conflict and colonization. I can see why people like this but I need more chaos, randomness and surprise in my games. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I was worried that now that I have played newer traitor games such as The Resistance or BSG, I would not enjoy Werewolf at all, but I was wrong. The game is very interesting (with a large enough group at least) and while you can most definitely sense the familiarity with the aforementioned games, it warrants its own existence within the world of gaming. It feels much more open, social and narrative compared to The Resistance and this edition of all  things adds a lot to it with all the different character cards etc. I am not a big fan of a manual that gives you two dozens of variant without at least suggesting where to start or which one works best (in the opinion of the designer). With the right group, this can be a hoot !</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Played this beast for the first time and it did not disappoint, sure, getting your head around the rules is a legendary feat but worth your while and the the rules are at least coherent and not badly written (like so many other games). It seems there are much more possible strategies than meet the eye and I quite like the idea of tactics being shaped through the random card draws (although I think there should have been a few more). A deep and engaging game. I love the theme (Tolkien !) and I think nothing needs to be said about the artwork and miniature etc. While not the most efficient (the map can be confusing and the figures look alike in parts), they are gorgeous. Brilliant Game. One of my favourites</comment>		<wantpartslist>I need the Legolas figure</wantpartslist>		</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Was keen to play this because it sounds good on paper but there first play was really tough and did not click (so far). The rules are very unclear and vague in parts which makes it more of a grind to learn and play than necessary. The game end trigger is a bit rubbish. The 10 influence points per player is too short but playing with the Might is Right variant will just cause the game to go on forever, where was the playtesting ? Maybe it is just because we played the game with three players but there had not been a single PVP confrontation in the whole game, bit dull. Everyone just went for the weak neutrals and hoped for the best.

I still think there is potential here but I wish I would not be so hard to find.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The boardgame of WWTOBAM lacks all the intensity of the TV show (if you can call it intense at all that is) and players ask each other question after question after question and if you get it wrong your out. So, where is the game in that ? Oh right, this is no game at all. It is just a novelty merchandise product. Don&#039;t buy.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Pretty much a very sugarcoated hidden identity movement game with a rich and pleasant theme woven around it. The game is very simply and lots of it depends on dice. I am not sure whether it actually plays better with less players because I found the fact that all horses had bets on them kind of weakened the idea of bluffing in the first place as all the horses eventually moved anyway. Still, the theme is great and the game can really animated a crowd. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I like games which depart from the common trivia style by prompting players to think different and be more creative in your cognitive approach. Yet, Wit&#039;s end relies on players intelligence and knowledge and it becomes very unbalanced very quickly. I have played this a few times and I noticed players becoming very frustrated when they noticed that they had no chance to win. Not a very fun and social game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>Played it only once in a pub and we got the rules wrong so I cannot pass judgment on it yet. I am sure it is more exciting when played with teams. So far, I found it a bit underwhelming and dull. 

Edit: Played it again and it is far from being the super-outrageous partygame, that is, if you do not play in teams. I can see how this would be amazing in teams, but it will be hard to find 12 to 14 people. Still a great game, but I wish I had known that the experience is only half-baked when playing without teams. </comment>				</item>

Good for kids and Disney fans, but are purely factual game, which is something I loathe. If you do not know it, tough luck, no cleverness or wit will help you out. HX</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>An interesting wordgame that might get even more interesting with more players (i.e. Team Play). We played it back to back as a 2-Player game and it had the tendency to drag on towards the end with only a handful letters going back and forth. The basic idea is very cool but I found that some if not most of the cards are a bit bland and not very creative. For example, instead of making one side easy and hard ( Actually, I found the easy ones much harder than the hard ones ), they could have made one side regular questions (A mammal) and the other side crazy/fun questions ( A stupid Halloween costume etc.). 

Still, a neat family / word game</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The game does sound way more complicated that it. It is pretty much a rummy-style game with players trying to collect the most cards of a specific outlaw as possible in order to reek in the biggest awards. The game is spiced up with action cards than can both hurt other players and benefit yourself but can also go wrong. The theme is nice and better than just using generic suits etc. Still, the game can be a bit daunting at times, but it becomes clear once you start playing a few hands. Might be a tad too long for what it is but I suppose you can&#039;t just lower the winning VP threshold. There might be a lot of luck involved in the card drawing too, which I don&#039;t mind but hardcore card game purist might find that not very amusing.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>As light as it gets, a simple Knizia cardgame. Not super elegant but effective. The last few cards are almost random and the game reminds of 6 Nimmt ( Category 5) and how you the best laid plans can end up in total chaos in the last turn which makes the game more luck-based and more of a filler than anything else.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>A great party game that gets people involved. The fact alone that you don&#039;t play it one a table but in a room, walking around and doing silly things terrifies some people but many others do enjoy it. If you are not that fussy about the rules, than you will have a great time with 4 to 6 people, or maybe more ? Good stuff.

EDIT: Pretty much an exercise in silliness. The vague rules however can make the game a bit frustrating. What exactly are you allowed to do, mime, say, gesture, say with your expression etc. and if you are trying to play this game to win, it is a bit hard without having a few referees around as there is no way of telling if people stuck to the rules (whatever they may be). A silly and fun past time but not a game in the true sense of the word.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>A very simple yet elegant auction / bluffing game about collecting sets. However the crux lies in the fact that you offer a number of cards (yet the actual value remains hidden). Lovely little gem.

EDIT: Burned out a bit on it after only half a dozen plays. Still a nice game but there are a few &#039;tricks&#039; and &#039;loopholes&#039; which ca quickly annihilate new players and I think those mechanics could have used some more playtesting and tweaking. Also,the game plays very similar each time. 

EDIT2: Played this again after quite some time and somehow it always plays the same and follows the same pattern. Unfortunately I feel there are quiet a few loopholes of strategy in the game that can be exploited by experienced players. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>I can see how this game seems overwhelming at first sight and more or less like a super brainburner or a tediou excercise in trial and error like Mastermind (to which this game is wrongly compared), but if played with a lively bunch which do not mind some collective vocal pondering this becomes a fantastic experience and requires some thinking outside of the box (literally). Simple yet very effective, Zendo is a great game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Great card game in the tradition of Wizard. Make sure to win the right number and colour of tricks to avoid points. All this plus a saboteur whose goal it is to screw everyone else up ! Pretty neat card game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Superlight Push Your Luck Filler with a neat &quot;theme&quot;. I  say theme but it&#039;s really just the artwork on the casing and coloured dice. It is barely playable with my house rules but otherwise just an act of randomness. Might be fun with kids or non-gamers as a filler. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Solid Agricola-Super Light with each player caring and growing its own Zoo on a seperate board. The interaction comes with choosing which animals (truck) to take, just like in Coloretto and buying animals from other players&#039; barns, even though this does not happen enough and should be cheaper in my opinion, in order to promote player interaction a tad more. Still, cute theme and artwork. </comment>				</item>
