	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>A very interesting game, entirely composed of making strange trades with the board to try to reach a goal &quot;worth&quot;.  There are just a few differences between this, and its earlier incarnation, [thing=1520][/thing]:

[thing=2184]The First Million[/thing] claims to be for 2-4, rather than 3-4.  It is significantly less interesting with 2 players, and has no rules to make it more interesting for 2.

[thing=1520][/thing]&#039;s circular symbols provide more of a visual distinction between the commons (10k) and the higher-value things, which I think is helpful.

[thing=1520][/thing]&#039;s goals are the 80&#039;s, while The First Million&#039;s are 1 MIO (1M) money bags.  The 80 makes sense, where the million does not, because in both cases, you can &quot;buy&quot; the 80 for a total of 80 in smaller cards, and the &quot;million&quot; for a total of 800,000 in smaller stocks.

[thing=2184]The First Million[/thing]&#039;s colors are matched complementarily and intuitively (though the print run could have better distinguished them), which is an improvement over [thing=1520][/thing]&#039;s weird pairings of colors.

In both, however, the goal items are quite different from the cards used to play the game.

There is just something kind of fascinatingly mechanical, yet opportunistic about this game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>2010-05-16: An amazing portion of the strategy is in the setup, and in setting yourself up to bring ghosts back into play in the most constraining ways possible, since your opponent places your returning ghost, but must place it on its color carpet....

2012-01-12: One of the things I dig about this game is how counter-intuitively you can progress.  For this reason, you must watch your opponent and the total situation carefully.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>All the decisions, in and of themselves, are pretty much tradeoffs.  Your challenge is to make synergistic choices toward a greater strategy.  As such, this game provides pretty singular gameplay experience.  The downtime caused by the [thing=15364][/thing]-style auctions to dodge negative effects, and even by the more traditional round-robin auctions for the land tiles can be excessive, which detracts from the game some.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 6.96

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Though this game uses die-rolling to determine movement, seemingly more out of it being traditional than because it makes sense for the game, 221B Baker Street is a pleasant game.  Players use clues - some delightly vague and realistic; others specific, like in the cheaty sort of charades (e.g. &quot;the third letter of the killer&#039;s name is G&quot;) - to figure out the different aspects of the crime themselves.  Some cases may only require few aspects to be figured out; others, many.  Each case is presented as a narrative, which ends in a specification of what the players need to discover, as well as a declaration that &quot;the game is afoot,&quot; of course.

One really nice element of this game is that you can have Scotland Yard mark a location, which you&#039;re leaving, off-limits to the other players unless they utilize a key to unlock it.  This is a great way to protect key evidence.  It&#039;s an even greater way to waste people&#039;s time in a bluff, by protecting a location with no evidence.  Especially using the inexpensive expansions with more cases, this game has pretty decent replay value.  The game itself will feel about the same, but snooping around for clues will take you to different places, and always have you sussing out the solution to the mystery!</comment>	<conditiontext>Includes mystery sets 4 and 5</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>Nice drafting game with next-door-neighbor interaction to make it quite playable with 7 players.  Impressively, the 2-player drafting works really well, too, due to the clever mechanisms provided to create a schizophrenic third player (played alternately by each player... from the real player&#039;s slightly-enhanced hand!).

As I play this more, I think my rating my be at risk of rising from [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] to [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b]....</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.58

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>The dish is silly and fun.  The coffee lottery is just kind of weird, because you&#039;re already trying to complete recipes as quickly as possible.  Adding something that rewards you for completing a recipe seems sort of redundant.  It just raises the stakes (steaks? :p), but not in a way that affects people&#039;s decisions much.  If a few cups get queued up, then you will choose easy recipes as you complete the first, but it&#039;s thoroughly possible never to see even one in a game.  :shrug:</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.28

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>An incredibly fun and fast-paced abstract tactical game.  The fact that it can be played by up to six people ­ which, incidentally, provides a fresh excitement if one is accustomed to two-player games of Abalone ­ makes it even an option for parties; though the best way to entice party-goers is to get one other person to play it with you, so the spectators may be mesmerized by the organic movement of the opposing sides.  Then, when you say that up to six can play, the barb is lodged squarely in some cheeks.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Much prettier and more interesting to play than [thing=11901]tic-tac-toe[/thing]; however, despite the wiggly lines, optimal plays seem quite calculable.  That said, the choice whether to benefit yourself or thwart your opponent spices things back up (e.g. Do I set myself up for 1 sure and 3 other potential points, or prevent my opponent from getting 2 now?).  The person who draws the bendy line must be very careful not to provide one space that is far superior to the others, but that is the goodness of the rules:  You&#039;re always giving the best slice to your opponent, which is incentive to cut the cake fairly.</comment>				</item>

The double-suited card make it hard to clear your hand of suits so you can start trumping; however, leading with aces and crowns helps to purge other people&#039;s hands of those specific suits.  If you can&#039;t follow suit, you can create/change the trump suit by playing an ace; on the other hand, if someone else is also out of the led suit(s), any card in your trump ace&#039;s suit beats your ace.  ...and of course, any other ace beats your ace, by changing the trump suit on you.  Ace Trump is a very worthy member of the trick-taking family!</comment>				</item>

Nearly everyone who has had enough volition to get over its uninspiring concept (unless you&#039;re a broker at heart) has discovered the thrill of this superb game.  Though I have seen a player downtrodden from the start, I have only seen such misfortune once.  Play this game.  The biggest downside of it is that you can run yourself out of cash, and have no way to trigger income, but that&#039;s mostly in how much risk you choose to toy with in playing the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This unusually-themed game provides interesting risk-management and competitive choices for the players.  With 28 folders in the game, a maximum of 20 of them will score, meaning a single player could be completely shut out if she&#039;s not careful.  Manipulating the order of things to get your folder in the optimal cabinet could be an exercise in analysis paralysis, but action cards and banked extra actions reduce the efficacy of long-term plotting.  On the other hand, on a first go, players might feel like they don&#039;t have as much control as they like; however, more experienced players should find it fun to anticipate their opponents&#039; plays, and willingly surprise their opponents with an unexpected play.

[person=1106]Andrea Meyer[/person]&#039;s designs continue to please me, in offering something fresh mechanically.

That said, it&#039;s still a brilliant core game, and Adapt3 grants the satisfying ability to eliminate three adaptoids (total) belonging to two different players in a single move. :ninja:</comment>				<wishlistcomment>NULL</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Rock solid game, here.  [person=1115]Glenn[/person] has come a long way since [thing=6707]Age of Mythology[/thing].  This game is laden with tough decisions and gambles.  While comparisons could be drawn to several respected games, [thing=22545]AoE3[/thing] gels into its own unique experience.  The miniatures are, of course, excess, but they&#039;re fun, and unlike [thing=6707]AoM[/thing], you needn&#039;t refer to cards for them the whole time.  This is a really good game, and it not only feels good, it also evokes the them quite nicely.  Minimizing your expeditions without risking failure...  Choosing which crucial action you need to nail first, so no one beats you to the punch, only to find that the other critical one is what people wanted...  Many ways to approach the game successfully.  This is a joy to play.  From 2 to 6 players, this game is fraught with tough decisions and delicate competition for resources.

Incidentally, using cubes on the score track works way better than using colonists!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Feinting and bluffing can be helpful, as keeping your &quot;chosen&quot; peoples a secret may help shield them from attack.  On the other hand, empowering them and upgrading their technology gives them a better chance of earning you those precious victory points.  The ability to cash in on others&#039; success by &quot;betting&quot; a people will reach their maximum size helps level the playing field if your peoples have gotten pounded.  Since you are dealt nearly your entire hand of actions right at the start of the game, you can strategize to a moderate degree.  (Nearly everything is resolved by die rolls, and the chaotic influence of other players&#039; actions and combat tend to require a lot of reaction and adaptation of your plans.)

Due to the structure of the game, more players directly means more time.  This is a game that takes X minutes per player to play, so when you play with six, it&#039;s several hours long.  I&#039;d like to try it with two next, which should be suspenseful!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Anybody imaginative could have fun with this game&#039;s units, despite the game&#039;s rules.  This game offers a lot, but plays very slowly, due to players&#039; decisions having to be made on the fly.  Unfortunately, it is extremely unforgiving of mistakes, which can send your potential for victory plummeting.  Though my distaste for dice-throwing battle resolution biases me, I have attempted to filter that bias from my scoring of the game.  The game duration, however, really sucks a lot of joy out of the game.  Though the game has a clever victory point bank which serves to limit the number of turns in the game, the turns take an eternity or two.  Lucky draws of [i]Gather All[/i] cards for the same player means another player can go without resources for several turns consecutively.  Although the units are beautiful, they really serve no purpose other than to look cool, and pull you into the theme:  For battle, you have to refer to their cards anyway in order to determine their traits, so like [thing=2542]Gargon[/thing], I would have no problem just using the cards.  I adore, however, bumping the kitty on the different victory point prizes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>2008-11 [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] In my first play, like my first play of [thing=9440]Maharaja[/thing], there were several rules I&#039;d misunderstood, and it took the first couple of rounds (a significant percentage) to unravel those misconceptions.  Unlike [thing=9440]Maharaja[/thing], [thing=4098]Age of Steam[/thing] will kill a man for mistakes like those.  I stayed in the game, financially, but was not competitive for first place.

I think there&#039;s an excellent game in there, but one that requires seasoned players to cleanly and quickly bring newbies up to speed if they are to be competitive - although it&#039;s more forgiving in this regard than [thing=483]Diplomacy[/thing], no question!

2015-05-05 [b][bgcolor=#80FFCC] 7.5 [/bgcolor][/b] I relearned the game with [thing=30929]Barbados[/thing], and am into it again. Getting to learn it from the rules, instead of a [i]meh[/i] teacher, has allowed me to enjoy it without brutality through misunderstanding.</comment>	<conditiontext>A previous owner [b]almost[/b] invisibly pasted over the Detroit misprint with a proper 3.</conditiontext>			</item>

[b]Argentina[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] The &quot;fire&quot; cubes are very cool. I like how this map feels. Delivering fire, and scooping up fire for delivery add some really interesting speculation and urgency to the game, and the Andes and Malvinas are nothing to sneeze at, either. [clear] [floatleft][imageid=2045518 micro][/floatleft]
[b]French Riviera[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] I found the layout interesting and challenging, but my opponents were not fans, and do not want to play it again. One, right out of the gate, was suggesting changing the rules and/or map, and two wanted more pre-printed cities on the map. They were first and second place, so they clearly rose to the challenge, but they still weren&#039;t into it. :shrug: As for me, I thought the clustering of city colors was interesting, and the requirement of Engineer to build on the cost made that role, and therefore the turn order, hotly contested, which was nice. Er, not to be confused with Nice….</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>When my [boardgameversion=23710]Eagle Games 3rd edition[/boardgameversion] copy arrived. I was very pleasantly quite surprised to find this inside it!
[floatleft][imageid=738875 micro][/floatleft]
[b]Barbados[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] Since it had been 6½ years since my first and only play of [thing=4098][/thing], I was delighted to use Barbados to &quot;refresh my memory&quot;. I flunked out, forgetting the fatal brutality of the early-game AoS economy. The next day, I played the &quot;baby&quot; version with twice as many cubes starting in the cities, figuring I needed to get back up to speed with the game. No problem, I won. So I played again, but switched back to the normal game. 49! Now I was starting to get addicted. …and that&#039;s the point: This is an addictive solitaire map that you can play in 20 minutes once you know what you are doing.  Great stuff. [clear] [floatleft][imageid=738879 micro][/floatleft]
[b]St. Lucia[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] Instead of goods production, you just scarf up stuff that&#039;s on the board; however, with the bonus income boost for the owner of the track from which the cube is moved, it&#039;s more about head-to-head strategic planning, with some opportunity for turn order pseudo-bidding to be worthwhile.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Interesting strategic and (mostly) tactical game.  I suspect the play dynamics are quite different depending on the number of players, providing a different type of experience with 2 than with 3 than with 4.

As a bonus, though I&#039;d seen no mention of it anywhere, my copy came with a mini-expansion, [b]Blauhzan&#039;s Favor[/b], which adds a 0 card for each player.  The 0 card, which you can see in this image... [imageid=98680] ...depicts the runestone, and activates like the 1 (fire) and 2 (revolt) cards do.  Its function, however, is take ownership of the rune stone.  We&#039;ll have to try it this way next time!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>50</numplays>			<comment>Oh, yeah.  This is the good stuff.  The &quot;family game&quot; feels elegant, but the competition for same resources is rough. In the more advanced games, the cards you get not only help each player specialize in something slightly different, they also serve as a marvelous distraction if you poorly judge their value for your particular situation.  They provide CCG-style boosting and combos, so it can be [too] exciting to try them out.  Marvelous game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>2008-10-27: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] Funny, spicy, thematic, harsh, cruel, surprising (at least if you don&#039;t peek ahead, which thematically seems like the right way to play).  I&#039;m sure that after you play through them all, it becomes a novelty that you&#039;d only bring out if you want a crazy game, but it&#039;s nice!

2011-11-17: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] I&#039;m no longer addicted to finding out what&#039;s in the deck and how it will play, but it&#039;s still quite fun to bring out on occasion.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>24 cards.  Immediate need for rules interpretation.  The cards are cute, amusing, and sometimes powerful; however, they are instant damage to the game due to the lack of clarification for several of them.  For instance, the Dance Instructor&#039;s behavior is nothing but exception, and there&#039;s no explanation whatsoever for how it&#039;s supposed to fit into the game:
Take food before you play it.
Immediately put it back into your hand.
Sounds easy enough, but now you go to play it or another Occupation.  Does the missing Dance Instructor count as your first?  How about for meeting prerequisites of cards that require some number of occupations?  Cute, wacky idea that brings the game to an absolute halt as the players try to come to a ruling on it.
That said, there are more good cards than troublesome ones, and this is otherwise a fun injection into the game.  With clarifications for those exceptional cards, I think this would be nothing but goodness.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Yep.  Focus Agricola on the animals, make it for two players only, and you can compress it to 30 minutes of tough decisions and worker blocking.

It adds a tide, a cadence to the game - a tide you can ride, or you can go against it in order to capitalize on things people were hoping to snatch up when they were more tempting (i.e. snatch them when the competition is low).  It fits perfectly.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I didn&#039;t really know what to expect, given this game&#039;s pedigree, but what we get is a fairly fast-paced share jockeying game, with a dash of route maneuvering, just to optimize your costs and opportunities.  It makes use of some its [thing=94]dad[/thing]&#039;s notions, like the Union Pacific / Air Abacus shares that seem inconvenient and undesirable, but provide heavy payouts by game end.  ...and the mysterious end of the game.  I&#039;m unfamiliar with its [thing=43]mom[/thing], but what&#039;s ultimately important is how [thing=90419]the offspring[/thing] stands on its own:  It does just fine!  A nice, solid share game, with the expected cautious boosting of the market values for companies in which you may lose the advantage.  There is the additional surprising factor that folks may choose to dispose of shares in order to buy into Air Abacus — but while the drop in shares can be sudden, it serves as a warning shot that an increase in the other cometh.

There are plenty of in-jokes / tips of the hat on the cards, which is a nice touch.  It can feel a little frustrating if you are trying to get particular shares, so you can get them into play, but if you roll (or should I say [i]fly[/i]?) with what you get, you should do fine.  Remember that your opponents face some of the same frustration.  The lower-cost hops available earlier in the game, as well as the tight money situation (and of course the interim scorings) help devalue hoarding for a late-game KA-POW, but it is still possible, and perhaps viable; however, I feel this is much better mitigated than in [thing=9209][/thing], in which the connection opportunities can be insufficient incentive to play early and often, rather than hoard and then strafe the board.</comment>	<conditiontext>Missing one 1VP token.

Although it has that unpleasant notion that rolling higher is always better, due to the implementation that complaint doesn&#039;t feel fully relevant somehow.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Quick, intense game of second-guessing your opponent, so you can get the cards you want, and avoid those you don&#039;t.  The catch is that you must carefully select where you dump each card you win, in order to maximize your score.  The scores can swing as wildly as in [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing]:
Our first game, the scores were 37 to 34 - 34 was the player who took most of the cards, and had a heavy pile in the -1× stack.  Our second game, the scores were 113 to 10, and the 113 player had all but four of the cards - which of course meant a huge pile in the -1× stack; however both black tens were in the 2× stack with two kings and a queen, and the 1× stack had both red tens with all face cards.  Thus, 2× produced 88 points, 1× produced 48, and -1× produced -23 points.</comment>	<conditiontext>with spielbox 4/2007</conditiontext>			</item>

You can pretty much play this game in absolute silence, but the game offers some fun anyway.  With six players, you pretty much have to scrabble for every tile or bit of currency you want; with two, the game automatically becomes a little more strategic, especially with &quot;Matt&quot;, the fake third player, who reminded me vaguely of the Bohnenmafia in Al Cabohne, right down to players being able to feed him, in order to frustrate their human opponent.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>2013-11-11: [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] Good replay value, and the fickle nature of the tower can give you some interesting challenges; unfortunately, it also can give everyone cruddy options, which speeds the game along, but in an unthrilling way.  Still, on the whole, I like the way this mechanism works for the game.

2013-11-30: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] There&#039;s plenty of replayability in this, but the game is anticlimactic.  The excitement builds for the first few rounds, but by the end, you&#039;re just gliding as far as you can on mostly obvious choices.  A bigger map could mitigate this somewhat, but I think it would still peter out at the end, perhaps later, perhaps less, but still anticlimactic.

2013-12-04: [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b] Although the varying islands and pleasantly obnoxious action cubes provide plenty of replay value, I sadly find that I enjoy this game less every play.  It pretty much boils down to this procedure over the course of the game:  Race to place as many outposts as possible, because if you have significantly fewer placement opportunities than your mates later in the game, you&#039;ve already lost.  Then (possibly overlapping with the race for outposts), scarf up as many matching goods and production tiles as you can.  All the while, do a little of this and that to give yourself an edge via progress tiles.  Race anyone else on &quot;your&quot; islands to place the tiles you planned.  As the space to build dwindles, and the tiles available to you run out, the excitement shrinks and shrinks.  So, there are things I like [b]about[/b] the game, but I don&#039;t think I like the game.</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>This is a cleverly counterweighted game, providing players plenty of choices to vie for prestige.  One four-player game may end with a winning score over 100, and another with a winning score under 50, which illustrates how dynamic this game can be.  Plus, you get a little &quot;Rochester&quot; card drafting, which is generally a good thing.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Anachronism does what it sets out to do, and provides you with very nice cards with which to do it.  The game simulates combat between a pair of [in]famous individuals from different eras.  Each character even has some equipment to utilize, which affects his combat strengths.  Unfortunately, while the game mechanisms function well enough to simulate the quasi-gladiator melee, those mechanisms do not sufficiently hold my attention, even to get me to play a second game right after a first.  For instance, rolling dice to determine the successes... of your... [yawn] attacks.... [snore]

&quot;Wouldn&#039;t it be cool if, like, Sun Tzu and Alexander the Great had a cage match to the death?&quot;

Er, no, not really.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;ll have to try it again, before I can enjoy it — if I am to enjoy it.  I definitely think the potential is there.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 6.75

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Not bad:  Give each player some time to practice with the catapult, shooting at the wall, then remember to set it up so the level is perpendicular to the firing arc, unlike the video game.  The point system is well implemented, and as long as you play the variant that the level stays set up, and players take turns at it until it gets hit, the action is pretty good.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 4.00

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This game presents some interesting counter-concepts, but is so carefully balanced to allow fair competition between the two philosophies, that it feels too balanced and pointless.  Imagine a tug-of-war that is only allowed to go for 10 seconds.  Yeah, it&#039;s kind of like that.  The game is played for a fixed period, rather than to oblivion, but it just doesn&#039;t feel like you can really take advantage of the game length.  My thoughts on this game are muddled because I&#039;m a bit befuddled as to how this keeps getting republished, when there are plenty of decent, good, excellent, and superb games out there, unpublished.</comment>				</item>

All of these complex decisions are elevated to shining brilliance through [geeklist=74936]simultaneous play[/geeklist], which virtually eliminates downtime from the game — downtime that would be agonizing in a game of this complexity.  In addition, the players choose their own goals, on the fly, as they play.  Incredible!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This game clearly feels like it&#039;s intended to be a party game (which is perfectly fine).  Despite this, the player interaction is nearly nonexistent.  The game doesn&#039;t really require people to converse, argue or interact at all.  A judge plays a descriptor, and each other player plays some type of noun (many are people or events) which they think will appeal to the judge in the context of the descriptor.  The judge then chooses the favored card, by whatever strikes her/his fancy.  Some of the potential card combinations provide some chuckles, but nothing really struck me as hilarious.  As the supposedly 30-minute game drags out to two hours, it loses people&#039;s attention to the point that referees don&#039;t even read the cards aloud; the game just becomes something for your hands and eyes to do while you gab.  Even played with the zaniest, most fun people, the game runs way too long to be fun the whole way through.  (A six-player game could last 51 rounds.)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Wow, after a lively, fun bunch of people convinced me to play this recently, I was sure my rating was going down.  I&#039;d forgotten that I&#039;d already appropriately rated it a [b][bgcolor=#ff3366] 2 [/bgcolor][/b].  Mistake #1:  [family=33]Apples to Apples[/family] should be played at most to 5 cards, not 10.  Since the nature of the &quot;game&quot; doesn&#039;t evolve as you play it (just do the same thing every single turn), there&#039;s no reason to make it long.  Make it short, and let people have fun for the whole 10 minutes.  If they&#039;re still hungry for more, they will play again.  If they&#039;re ready to move on, they can, guilt free.  30 minutes indeed!  Two hours, minimum.  See my comments on the parent game for more proper complaints.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Very nice production quality from Queen, as is usually the case.  There is some interesting stuff going on here, but it doesn&#039;t excite me very much.  The merciless scoring can provide some interesting choices, but often, you have few or no choices, and just get screwed out of points if you happen to run out of options at the wrong point level.</comment>				</item>

The bonus of having this game (especially two copies of it) is that its cards are very useful for landscape in certain games using Looney Labs&#039; Icehouse set.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Not my sort of game at all.  Others seemed to like it, though!  It definitely benefits from more players, and those players being lively and fun - gregariousness helping a lot.

I guess I just don&#039;t dig sitting around prodding to see which apple is bad - who&#039;s telling the truth and who&#039;s not - especially in order for nearly any one player to say, &quot;STOP,&quot; and make an accusation.  Right or wrong, that player determines which whole team gets prizes, then an individual player wins - often with just three cards, when most of the other players have a maximum of 30% of the victory condition.

I&#039;m glad that other people dig it so much, and due to the brevity of the plays, if fun people desperately want me to play, and there&#039;s nothing I&#039;d rather do, I can be convinced.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This didn&#039;t really strike me as something that would be my sort of game, and it really isn&#039;t, but it is much more fun than I would have guessed, given that.  Secret accumulation of resources to build your forces... until an attack occurs, at which point [-]units[/-] forces face off like a football line of scrimmage.  Combat is resolved through horrific die rolls, but the variety in the unit types and abilities makes it much more interesting than it could be.

[b]The rulebook should raise the bar for all multipage rulebooks:[/b]  There is a fusion of glossary, index, and rules-distilled-into-mini-encyclopedia near the back.  How the heck does a Raid ATTACK card work?  Look in the index for [i]Raid[/i].  Read the beautifully succinct explanation there.  Still unsure?  No problem:  The page number where you can find the answer is listed to the right, index-style.  Your first couple of plays, you will need to use the rulebook as a reference material, and once I noticed the index, every subsequent question that arose was answered in mere seconds.  That said, the rules aren&#039;t so cumbersome that you will stand, ankle-deep in the rulebook each time you play.  Most of it makes good sense, or at least is reasonable, and you will be able to recall easily enough if you play it with any frequency.

Finally, the variety of &quot;factions&quot; at your disposal is very nice.  It&#039;s not just &quot;My Heavy Tank attacks your Heavy Tank.&quot;  Nope, it&#039;s more like &quot;My Artillery attack the Boulders you are telekinetically flinging at my forces.&quot;  ...and one of the factions has no base to defend — well, sort of — because it is a gigantic mech, that pretty much acts as a mobile base.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Interesting and solid game.  I like that pieces can only push and pull each other around, rather than killing one another.  Of course, you can push or pull them into traps to eliminate them.  There&#039;s nothing quite as dramatic as the move in which your elephant helps a rabbit across a trap, but the rabbit freezes in terror on the other side, standing face-to-face with your opponent&#039;s own elephant.  Not to fear, the rabbit&#039;s own elephant steps onto the trap behind him to hold his paw and lend him confidence.  At the elephant&#039;s insistence, the rabbit hops forward to victory, but in so doing, has released the elephant, who plummets to his doom.
Er, yes, well, good game, basically is what I&#039;m trying to say.  ...and I guess your imagination can go a little wild.</comment>	<conditiontext>Own chess set, with which this is intended to be played.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The amount of work, and good editing that went into this game is amazing.  Its fabric is densely woven with theme; however, for my tastes, there is way more mucking around with rules, phases, steps, cards, and tokens than there should be for the really small number of interesting decisions to make.  Like [thing=10547]Betrayal at House on the Hill[/thing], there&#039;s just too little interesting going on, and negligible strategy to be had.  Unlike [thing=10547]Betrayal at House on the Hill[/thing], Arkham Horror is specifically designed to last at least X long, where X is way, way too long for my tastes:  After four hours, I would prefer to be more than merely halfway toward just one of the victory conditions - in fact, I&#039;d prefer to have played several exhilarating games laden with agonizing decisions!

However, as with all &quot;experience&quot; games, playing with the right people - especially if the time was pre-ordained for this game - can make for a fun time.</comment>				</item>

The central, revolving meat market prevents you from much planning before your turn, even though you can see your hand the whole round, but since there are only the six cards to inspect, it doesn&#039;t create too much downtime at the starts of players&#039; turns.  The designers&#039; [thing=463][/thing] experience shows in some of the card designs, providing some nice synergy, and it gets the players&#039; gears turning.  Finally, the iconography and formatting of the cards is solid and consistent, facilitating fast play.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 6.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This just is not for me.  There is always a 33% chance of &quot;scoring&quot; (a term which I feel should be used pretty loosely), unless it just happened, in which case there is a 0% chance of it.  Each turn, you have three options:  Move the goods 3 or 4 down spaces down the line, move them 4 or 5, or move them 3 or 5.  That is the game.  You increment the score by doing a little multiplication and addition based on where the goods happen to be.  A typical game lasts about 13 turns, with about 4 of those being scorings (plus a final scoring).  Of course, it&#039;s theoretically possible to have as many 24 turns, half of them being scorings (or as few as 7 turns with only the final scoring).  I don&#039;t find the decisions sufficiently interesting for the amount of work you have to put into moving bits about and performing basic arithmetic.  Too bad, because its concept sounded interesting at first.

The good news is that you can play solitaire, using d6 (divide the roll by 2, rounding up) as an opponent, and that you probably have suitable components to play (for instance, 9 pennies and 9 dimes, and 6 red, 6 blue, 6 green cubes).  So if you crave this game, you can play all by yourself.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>This is the programming fun of [thing=18][/thing], made more challenging.  Not only are you on a short timer to program your turn, you don&#039;t have the luxury of holding only 5 pieces of information (with embellishments) in your mind while you program.  No, you have to program fully 7 steps, while keeping in mind three stages of asteroid movement, based on the values of three different dice... and the directions are different for each asteroid.  This is pretty harsh, but I like it.  Unfortunately, the cool style of ship design results in bleah ship pawns that indicate their orientation poorly.  I look forward to taking the [thing=65200][/thing] challenge again!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>Trifecta!!  Wow, this is brilliant and agonizing.  I love it!!

[b]4p[/b]: [b][bgcolor=#00cc00] 10 [/bgcolor][/b] The four-player simul-play is a brilliant way to cut the downtime to ⅓ what it would have been with purely sequential play.

[b]3p[/b]: [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] The downtime is doubled, but not quite excruciating; however, it does more than double the length of the 2p/4p game.

[b]2p[/b]: [b][bgcolor=#00cc00] 10 [/bgcolor][/b] Simply excellent.

[b]1p[/b]: [b][bgcolor=#00cc00] 10 [/bgcolor][/b] I love it.  It&#039;s a meaty, logistical solitaire game that you can play in under an hour.  The action card grid is delightfully torturous, yet permits for some clever strategic play and combo setup - something you typically don&#039;t have in any solitaire game!  (Exception: [thing=35443][/thing])  It&#039;s wonderful that Uwe&#039;s given us a sufficiently different solitaire experience that I actually specifically want to play this solitaire in addition to multiplayer.  That there is a hook of a mechanism that is unique to the solo game is quite cool!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>It can&#039;t be helped calling this &quot;Bingo for gamers&quot;.  This turns the Bingo concept into something that I can call a game.  You still face the cruel possibility of things being called that you simply don&#039;t have… and it happening for a long time; however, you also get to make choices, and decide how to play the odds.  You also get to make strategic statistical choices, and strive for synergy between your cards; however, not only are you at the mercy of the items being called, you are also at the mercy of what comes available on the deck.  The art is quite nice, and it beats some of the truly mainstream games in the US, so I&#039;d rather play this than certain other things, but I also am not likely to request it.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 4.00

One &quot;imbalance&quot; of it, however, is that it depends a bit on the players beating each other up similarly over the course of the game.  That isn&#039;t much to my tastes, but there is plenty of good in the game.  If that wouldn&#039;t bother you, this game is surely a win for you!</comment>				</item>

Now I say:  This game does a splendid job of mimicking the intricacies of the show, and can be fascinating to play.  It is very difficult to make effective decks, however, since you can be pulled every which way during the game, and people are rarely willing to risk conflicts they don&#039;t expect to win.  While giving an accurate sense of the environment, it can make the game drag on for ages.  There are so many things I like about this game, but I&#039;ve lost the will to play it, unless heavily coerced.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The eponymous battle balls are great, nearly-automatically transforming toys.  The game that employs them is passable.  I enjoy rolling marbles; however, many of these are designed with bumps and ridges that can steer them awry, which can be problematic, since you need to get the magnetic portion of the bakugan onto a [metal] gate card in order to attempt to claim the gate card.  The real problem is that to enhance this simplistic play, there are effects on ability, gate, and battle gear cards that affect the strength of the respective battle balls.  That can lead to a lot of adding in your head (or on paper, if you get desperate, I suppose).  In theory, it makes the battle more interesting.  In reality, if I pick stronger bakugan than you, you have to have amazing cards (or much, much better rolling skill) than I in order to beat me.

It [b]is[/b] a better game than one would expect, having transforming toys as the &quot;pawns&quot;, but I think I would have steered this collectible dexterity game in a different direction.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 5.50</wishlistcomment></item>

We played a freeform version of this using a dictionary, and had loads of fun ­ the only real problem with the dictionary version being the wait while people find a good word.  No doubt that could be fixed by using an egg timer to limit the search.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>We broke the game on our first play! There are only seven blue cards. Our hops had two blue, two blue, one blue, and one blue, respectively. All seven blues were on the table, and the only five valid plays were blue. The rules do not address this. On the other hand, some seasoned players boggled as they came to realize it was possible, so we must have just beaten the odds. Still, it was a game-abortion.

Now, to see what the ruling is on that apparently unusual situation that can actually be created several ways....  Found it:  [thread=322267][/thread]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is a very good game of strategy and physics, with just a little dexterity thrown in.  Even though it looks like a dexterity game, most of the success in the game is identifying blocks that are safe to remove, and bailing or passing when it just can&#039;t be done.  Solid rules, and nothing but choices make this a much more satisfying teetering tower game than most.</comment>				</item>

2013-03-06: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] This is such a fascinating game.  I definitely prefer to play with the abilities, although they slow and complicate the game.  It gives the game spice and greater suspense.

2014-09-24: 
Basic Game: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] 
Advanced Game: [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] If the players&#039; skill is balanced, the advanced game is so satisfying, with lots of back-and-forth, and careful pinning of each other&#039;s pieces.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The Tactics cards add some serious swing to the game, compared to [thing=372]Schotten-Totten[/thing], but I&#039;m not sure that swing is a good thing.  It makes Battle Line feel more exciting, but the elegance of the &quot;tactics&quot;-free &quot;battles&quot; in [thing=372]Schotten-Totten[/thing] is also overshadowed.  On the other hand, rather than just numbly drawing at the end of your turn, you must make a tough decision about which deck you will trust to give you something useful; made more interesting by the spiteful uses for most of the tactics cards.  All in all, fun, with a short time requirement.</comment>				</item>

So, the only &quot;exciting&quot; part is the tower… which releases the prisoner if a sign above it is hit.  The incentive for and odds of hitting this are so low that it&#039;s not worth the bother.  You really should house-rule it so that there&#039;s something crucial about this, or just get rid of them.  All the rest of the components are additional tried-and-true items.  Do you need more discs?  No (unless you lost them).  Do you need more soldiers?  No, it just makes the game longer.  The additional catapult is very welcome, though.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 5.00

Of course, you also get pretty disappointing results from certain weapons:  The cannons bite big wind.  The ballistas can work pretty well on a sufficiently smooth surface, if you load them well.  The new, wheeled catapults need to be held in place, but do pretty well.  I adore the goofy fire that pops up from the castle when you hit the front gate.

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>[b]Knight Battering Ram[/b] [b][bgcolor=#ff3366] 2 [/bgcolor][/b] It can&#039;t get enough speed to trigger its ramming effect, and can&#039;t even run down footsoldiers; however, running it into a castle door should at least still trigger that.

[b]Orc Triple Catapult[/b] [b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4 [/bgcolor][/b] Probably due to swinging triple the mass, it doesn&#039;t toss &#039;em very far, so as long as you&#039;re aware of that, it can be a good crowdmower.  Terrible for traditional catapult use, though.</comment>				</item>

2010-12-16: The [b]Gatling Gun[/b] ([b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b]) is only allowed to fire two discs per action, but the hopper holds several more than that, for those who are just having fun cracking off shots.  Unfortunately, it works about like a Roman Candle:  Some shots kind of flop flaccidly right in front of it; others get some fair distance.  I&#039;ve never seen it be useful from any range.  It&#039;s fun to operate, but not particularly useful.
2014-03-24: [b][bgcolor=#ff6699] 3 [/bgcolor][/b] It&#039;s pretty darn useless, except against very nearby grunts.

2010-12-16: The [b]Twin Crossbow[/b] ([b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b]) has two surprising and nice features:  It can pivot to adjust trajectory, and it can rotate to adjust aim, right where it sits.  This weapon is actually useful.  Bonus:  It has a seat on it that perfectly &quot;seats&quot; a soldier.  Although I didn&#039;t see anything in the rules about that, I would argue that you may have a guy on there to operate the weapon.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>[b]Knight Trebuchet[/b] [b][bgcolor=#ff3366] 2 [/bgcolor][/b] Let me count the reasons this fails. Firstly, its range is pitiful; it isn&#039;t set up to stretch the rubber band as hard as a standard catapult.  Secondly, traditionally, a trebuchet has incredible range, precisely because of the technology used to create it, most crucial of which are the wheels that allow it not to topple while wielding so much force; this has no wheels, although many weapons do.  Thirdly, although they&#039;ve mimicked the look of a trebuchet, for some reason, the ammunition-holding portion is on a separate joint from the rest, which in this case, acts to reduce the torque.  Fourthly, same as the Triple Catapult, when you&#039;re throwing more mass, you great reduce the range.

[b]Orc Mortar[/b] [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b] This has bad range, but it uses these awesome, misshapen rubber balls that look like boulders, and actually roll and knock soldiers over.  Were it chucking pucks (which it can throw farther, since they&#039;re lighter), it actually wouldn&#039;t be as good, because the rolling boulder can be devastating to ground troops.</comment>	<conditiontext>Knight Trebuchet vs. Orc Mortar</conditiontext>			<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 5.00

So far, however, it&#039;s ye old [family=50]C&amp;C[/family] engine, with its card screw and nothing-but-die-rolls combat resolution that can provide anything from perfect progress to perfect failure.  Both ends of that spectrum are pretty darn un-fun.</comment>				</item>

[b]The Admiral&#039;s Game[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] Significantly better than The Captain&#039;s Game:  Each ship is unique, so although it&#039;s still a good, old-fashioned dicefest, at least you are making choices.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>The Admiral&#039;s Game

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>2009-05-11: [b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4.5 [/bgcolor][/b] It think the game implements the show really well, but the downtime is a killer.  That, and even when we had three basestars and wads of raiders threatening a throng of civilians, I didn&#039;t really feel any tension:  The FTL was pretty much ready to go, and we popped out from under them.  It emulated the show beautifully, except I was not nervous whatsoever.  I blame this on myself, though:  I think I&#039;ve lost the emotional investment in collaborative games.  Fortunately, excellent company makes up for my lack of engagement by the game, so I can be talked into it by sufficiently charming people....

I really appreciated the card mechanism to allow subversive play.  It was reminiscent of [gameid=8671] (another mostly-collaborative game) combined with the undercover cop variant for [gameid=19237], in that the group contributes cards to overcome a crisis ([gameid=8671]), with the temptation to hold on to cards for personal gain ([gameid=8671] again), but the subversion happens in a probably secretive way, such that the moles can keep tunneling.... ([gameid=19237])  The excellent thing that [gameid=37111] adds is a pair of fate cards, allowing cylons to gamble and undermine the effort with a chance of not even letting anyone know there is any subversion whatsoever.  Countering that is the ability to force card play to be face-up for a crisis.

Again, as I said about [gameid=30549], I think anybody with any affinity for collaborative games, but (in this case) who can slot up to four hours of playtime will love this game.  If you enjoyed the show, you will probably enjoy the game that much more.

2010-12-29: [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b] As you slog through this, it gets a bit more tolerable, and can get a little engrossing.  Still not my cup of tea, but I [b]can[/b] be convinced, when I have nothing better to do for four hours.  Yes, sure, once everyone&#039;s played it many times, you can squirt it out in two hours.  While that&#039;s a much more acceptable timeframe, I hope I never get enough experience for that.  ;)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This game adds categories (accessed by a die roll) and luck-pushing to the original Chronology engine.  Unfortunately, these add three of the worse elements of Trivial Pursuit to an otherwise quick and fun game.  Fortunately, they don&#039;t completely wreck it.  It also adds rebound guessing from the other players, which Chronology doesn&#039;t need (but Trivial Pursuit does).

Although the luck-pushing works like it does in Can&#039;t Stop or Techno Witches, the game doesn&#039;t need this either, and it just adds the downtime so familiar from Trivial Pursuit.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Simple drafting game that&#039;s pretty fun, with very charming, imagination-fueling illustrations. In a 4-player game, all the room cards come into hands for drafting, so you can be a bit more sure of what&#039;s out there, but there&#039;s still only so much control you have, because you draft a card, then place it, draft, then place, etc. So, if you draft something plan-wrecking, you have to choose whether to chuck it (and every card until your plan works out, or you realize it&#039;s doomed), or to just change your plans. Typically, your score will be better if you do the latter.</comment>				</item>

I think they are sufficiently balanced, so I&#039;ll try that. The birdhouse is a good option.

That being said, however, played with a nutty bunch of people, you can have a lot of laughs playing it.  The theme seems rather well sewn into the fabric of the game.  Unfortunately, most of the decisions one has to make are either arbitrary (should I explore leftward or rightward?) or self-evident (should I go to the pentagram with the symbol in hand so I can work on winning?).  ...and, again, good luck finding the wall switch token, or the cloud token, or any other specific token in the sea of identical-looking tokens....</comment>				</item>

The lightweight negotiation, and little surprises that can happen due to the building types&#039; different scoring schemes make this rather interesting. By design, you do not have as much control as you do in most eurogames, but it provides the unique charm of this offbeat concept!</comment>	<conditiontext>#1198/5100</conditiontext>			<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.50

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Bharg is kind of a twisted member of the Mahjong family of games.  You create sets in your hand to &quot;bind&quot; cards, but can also bind them by having the correct suit on top of the ace discard pile.  Analyzing the sets and plays can be a little tricky if your wits aren&#039;t about you.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is a very good solitaire logistics game.  The appearance of the goods on the board is reminiscent of [gameid=4098].  Efficiency and economy are left to the player to calculate, but since the dice determine where goods appear, calculation sometimes only gets you as far as speculation.  Like [gameid=26990] and other games with proportional loans and interest, loans are a vicious cycle in [gameid=28630].  Great solitaire!

One clarification:  Though the rules don&#039;t seem to specify it, I assumed that a good cannot be delivered right where you picked it up.  That would be silly; however, if you scarf up several goods at once, it can be tricky to remember.  I will probably modify the Goods in Transit box to have the 24 source tiles on them, so you can always tell whence a delivery came.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>Excellent, suspenseful, risk-taking dexterity game. It looks so easy… until you try it. This game is so fun! Even the Level 1 cards start to get challenging. Level 1A routes are pretty much training levels, but even 1B get tricky. Some of 1C require a steady hand — or two independent steady hands!

The course is pleasantly difficult, and really does a great job of identifying your skill level; however, to determine start player, it&#039;s a waste of time.  If you want to pick a start player, just do so randomly and move on.  The only reason to use this card for that purpose is to have one more blocky challenge, and it certainly delivers that!</comment>				</item>

I think once my dexterity improves (and I play with my equilibrium in a good state!), I will find these routes more feasible, but in the meantime, most of them just serve as an exercise, rather than something we can accomplish in the context of the game.</comment>				</item>

Certainly way more enjoyable than I expected, but the player interaction is nearly nil.  This is a game that I [-]quite[/-] enjoy while I play it, but I don&#039;t want to play it again that day, for whatever reason.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Each guest that comes through is a tradeoff on several levels: I want the guest in my room to live so I can earn a little money. …but I want to kill guests for their money. …but I want this guest to build her/his annex for me so I can have its benefit. …but I need someone with her/his skills to help me accomplish these gruesome and dirty deeds. Wads of what I love in a game (tradeoffs) in a quick playtime (extensible as you see fit). The theme is off-putting, but the presentation and mechanisms make it so appealing that I can thoroughly enjoy the game anyway.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Most of the Flit characters are retreivable, to illutrate their wingedness, and it really works.  The trouble is that they&#039;re a little weak on their own, so you need to apply their big &quot;secret&quot; weapons well:  paired booster cards, a leadership card that lets you play any number of boosters on one turn, and a leadership card that lets you discard three characters to attract a dragon.  Otherwise, you mostly remain as aloof as you can, trying to bleed off their strong cards with a retrieve-and-retreat strategy, while still cycling your deck enough to get the goods where you need them.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The Pillar is a solid deck with a couple of nasty combos - especially with the hand disclosers (including the Khind one in there) coupled with the Caterpillar discard filth.  Pillar versus Terrah has been a balanced struggle.  We ended a game with the last dragon going back into the middle as one player ran out of cards, and the other had only three left.  The names are amusing, and I adore the butterfly art.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>17</numplays>			<comment>OK, the not-quite-1½-year-olds ADORE this game.  This is a great example of a game for children:  They have a blast feeding the snake by putting the shapes into its mouth - especially if the snake enthusiastically declares what it wants to eat.  Of course, a little ophidian bulemia also delights them, as well.  There are two shapes in each color, so the snake can as for, say, something green to eat.  As their dexterity increases, they can feed the snake by putting the beads on the cord.  Then it progresses to a game of identifying the shapes by feel.

Will this ever go back into its box?

Nearly 2: They are starting to be able to thread the shapes onto Bella&#039;s tongue, and they can find the right shape and/or color that &quot;she&quot; requests.  They exuberantly ask for the game, and politely tell Bella, &quot;Bye, game,&quot; when it&#039;s time to put it away.  Seriously, this game is jest superb for kids this age.

3½: Can identify the shapes by feel, and even name the color of the piece without saying the shape name.</comment>				</item>

In this game for 3–6 players, pair off with your opponents to collaborate in building a structure from your different perspectives, as fast as you can.  The simple, but clever scoring mechanism rewards the fastest player who can also communicate well.

Oh yeah, because I can&#039;t seem to get it through my thick skull: [size=10][b]This is not a 2-player game[/b][/size]; players pair up during the game, but it is 3–6. I don&#039;t know why this is so hard to remember. :shake:</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 7.50

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s amazing how such small rule changes can streamline the play so much.
:colonist: New bean illustrations for all the beans.
:colonist: Stink beans (4) have been added.
:colonist: You always have three bean fields.
:colonist: The turn is simplified to three phases:  plant, trade, draw
:colonist: The trading no longer requires players to set aside the beans until the end of the phase.  Plant &#039;em as you get &#039;em.
:colonist: The face-up beans for trading are there the whole game, as the [i]bean market[/i], with three beans.
:colonist: You needn&#039;t plant beans from the middle of the table (now the [i]bean market[/i]):  Just leave them there.
:colonist: There is no longer a restriction on harvesting single-bean fields when there are other more mature fields (the single most confusing [thing=11][/thing] rule for new players).
:colonist: The game ends immediately after two times through the deck.
It enabled me to teach this to five-year-olds, and they got it.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s rather interesting and fun trying to coordinate your harvests with what&#039;s sitting on the docks on La Isla Bohnitâ in order to maximize the worth of your harvests.  Additionally, you must race your opponents to the beans you all want - or steal them right off their ships with your pirate ship....  This is one of the expansions that doesn&#039;t combine well with other game-altering expansions, such as [thing=913]High Bohn[/thing], [thing=2571]Mutabohn[/thing], [thing=13474]Telebohn[/thing], [thing=6264]Bohnaparte[/thing], and [thing=8174]Dschingis Bohn[/thing].

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Playing with four players is easier with a decent memory of what beans your partner lacked the last time you tried to pass her, but it&#039;s a light, suspenseful, fun time.

For the record, as amusing as the illustrations are, the fact that it&#039;s our favorite Bohnen is totally irrelevant.  This is a light soccer card game by [person=10]Uwe Rosenberg[/person], with beans - as far as I can tell - for the heck of it.  Way cuter than if it were humans, and this way, upon seeing the art, you&#039;re already not expecting a deep, mind-bending game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Take the pleasant tricky torment of the Auftrag cards from [thing=1494]the second edition of Erweiterungs-Set[/thing], and amplify and vary it.

The 1-player game is a proper solitaire:  You can have serious windfalls and breeze through it, but the filthy opponent beans move very aggressively, setting a breakneck pace.  I find 1p [thing=31419][/thing] to be more challenging with [thing=26946][/thing] than with [thing=11][/thing], because the meddlesome babies can really muck up the works.  Solitaire [thing=31419][/thing] requires you to keep up a strong pace, and having to trash an occasional harvest because of a baby bean being on top can leave you stuck in prickly brambles.</comment>				</item>

Some of the games are great for car trips, others require writing utensils.  With 25 games in the box, odds are decent that you can find something to suit your hue of word-game-mood.  Of course, several are completely poor, as well.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[gameid=29486] is a simplified 5×5 sliding puzzle.  Simplified, because the tedium of getting the last row in order is eliminated.  Atop each tile is a number coin that probably doesn&#039;t match the tile.  Each time you move a tile, you may swap its coin with an orthogonally adjacent coin.  Due to the frequency with which tiles are moved in a sliding puzzle, and the simple fact that eventually, pretty much every tile slides by every other tile, getting the right number coin atop each tile is actually quite trivial, although it did make the puzzle slightly more interesting to solve at first.  Whatever you would rate a sliding puzzle will be extremely close to what you would rate this solitaire [gameid=2860] puzzle.  Still, it is an interesting idea, oh-so-vaguely reminiscent of [gameid=12633]&#039;s two layers of tile placement.</comment>				</item>

This is the choice of which column will receive possible magnetic boosts.  The more advanced game gives you more choices, but the game is well set up to allow for even more strategic play than that, should you choose to do so.  Very cleverly designed!</comment>				</item>

What it does thematically better than Agricola is non-exclusivity of action spaces that shouldn&#039;t be exclusive. (Agricola example: Only one player can bake bread per round? Huh? We both have ovens. What&#039;s the problem?) In Brew Crafters, everyone can brew, but snarfing raw materials is exclusive, of course. I can&#039;t wait to play this again, and may quickly find it to be a [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b].</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 9.25

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>This has a lot of little [metaphorical] cogs that work together and independently — and I like it.  Your first play will likely serve merely as education of what you want to differently next game — and I like that, as well.  In fact, I suspect that this is a game with enough depth that I will keep diving into it in different fashions in order to try to do better.

…and of course, it has helped me to become obsessed with Art Nouveau!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.36

This is a favorite game of most who&#039;ve played it.  Its big drawback is simply that it can take hours to play, but it is still greatly beloved!

Like [thing=155]Was Sticht?[/thing] (at least after you&#039;ve drafted your goals in [thing=155]Was Sticht?[/thing]) and [thing=3632]Too Many Cooks[/thing], your success is heavily dependent upon the order in which you attempt to tackle your goals, and the order in which your opponents choose to do theirs.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s odd:  I don&#039;t generally have much patience for dice-driven combat resolution, yet I found myself thinking about Caledea a lot while I was trying to fall asleep.  They&#039;ve done a number of clever things with this that makes it a good game.  First off, the total troop supply in the game is finite.  You can only acquire troops by establishing outposts, or by eliminating an enemy in a multi-player game.  Therefore, even if the game doesn&#039;t end due to outright conquest, attrition will bring it to a halt.  Brilliant.
Also, the map portrays a world that wraps in both directions, meaning that there is no such thing as a safe corner.  Also good.
Each nation has abilities which can be activated with funding provided by your outposts.  Lose control of an outpost, you lose the funding until you can recapture it.  Ah, but money doesn&#039;t accumulate.  Another great note.
You can only establish outposts on the two terrain elements that match your nation, which means that you never take control of someone else&#039;s territories.  You can merely shut down their operations there until they come back to reclaim it.  Nice.
The map is painstakingly designed (and illustrated in an eye-catching style) such that you must travel a minimum of three spaces to reach the next territory with your two terrain types - in other words, where you can build an outpost.
Finally, the dice-driven combat resolution is simple, painless, and makes a lot of sense:  The defender chooses the pair of units to fight.  You get one die per rank of your unit, plus one die per terrain feature present that pertains to your nation.  The same rules apply for the attacker and defender.  You both roll.  Highest single die wins, with a run-off for tie resolution.  Loser&#039;s unit leaves the game.  Thus, combat is costly (because units are finite) and quick, and you have a sense of the odds.  Attacking someone in transit is going to work a lot better than attacking them in their comfort zone.
There&#039;s a lot to appreciate here.  It is a really good amalgam of abstract strategy, [thing=181]Risk[/thing], and a touch of Euro (You can also win by building four castles around your capital.).</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Need to teach CABS members</wishlistcomment></item>

The trouble is that a player can sit there with a mitt full of cards they literally can never use, because they never have enough control to make Color A&#039;s largest area greater than Color B&#039;s.  I liked the difficulties of the decisions (for those who have plays they could make), though.</comment>				</item>

The &quot;base game&quot; plays nearly identically to [thing=267]Tycoon[/thing], challenging players with subtle choices and strategic options.  There are new constraints, but seemingly as many new liberties, as well.  Another good, solid game from [person=7]Kramer[/person] and [person=139]Rösner[/person].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Although there are some interesting mechanisms here, I feel this game must be played at top speed, in about half an hour, for it to be a [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] for me.

The differences between this and its remake, [thing=54643][/thing] are mostly cosmetic and ergonomic, for those who are choosing between them:
:colonist: Skyline 3000 adds one-use billboards that cost a point, reserve a spot for you, but then earn the winners in that chunk of the board an extra point.
:colonist: Skyline 3000 adds a score track around the outside to replace the innovative, fascinating, but [b]horrible[/b] score columns in this.  It&#039;s [b]far[/b] too easy to botch everyone&#039;s score in one bump or swipe — one stray sleeve, and the game is over.
:colonist: Skyline 3000&#039;s wooden components are bigger, and thus less likely to topple in play.  Oh, and the building layers are gray, instead of tannish.
:colonist: Skyline 3000&#039;s other components are bold, and brightly illustrated.  The board is very high-contrast.

I&#039;d take [thing=54643][/thing], were I to have one of them at all.  If you don&#039;t like the billboards that were added, you can play without them — treat them like a variant.</comment>	<conditiontext>Shelf wear around the box lid from previous owner(s).</conditiontext>			<wishlistcomment>0.7+:	 8.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>At first, the Bridges sound exciting, the Bazaars sound cumbersome, and the Castles sound iffy.  In practice, the Castles are great, the Bridges provide some very interesting strategic outs, once you adapt to the mindset of using them, and the Bazaars inject some interesting point swings when that &quot;perfect&quot; tile comes up for auction.  Nice!</comment>				</item>

[b]King[/b]:  [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b]  The King and Robber Baron provide some more agendas to motivate the players again toward making large cities and long roads and completing others&#039; cities and roads.  This partially bridges the already small rules gap between [thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing] et al and [thing=7717]Carcassonne: The Castle[/thing].  The extra tiles are very welcome additions, as well.

You may opt to score a little less so your scoring watchman (hey, he walks on the castle wall, OK?) lands on a corner, nabbing a wall tile.  This could be a point bonus, or a rule-bending scoring of an incomplete building at the end of the game, or a number of other things.  Finally, somewhat like in Mexica, open, unestablished space at game end still gets awarded, so it should not be ignored.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is a brilliant example of an expansion.  More tiles have been added, some of which include goods on them.  Opponents are given incentives to complete your cities, since the person laying the tile which completes a city gets its goods, even though that person may not be the one to get the points for the city.  Since having the most of a good type at game end provides a nice point bonus, it&#039;s often worthwhile for a Trader-minded individual to complete her opponent&#039;s city.  Furthermore, the Builders accelerate the tile consumption and grant incentives for different plays than one might normally make in [thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing].</comment>				</item>

Unlike billiards, you don&#039;t have a cue stick to aim accurately, so you need to have serious flick-fu.  Fun, but you definitely benefit from practice (as with [gameid=403]).</comment>				</item>

With two or three players, this is a very fun, very good game; however, I suspect with all the direct conflict and action screwage, I would not enjoy it much at all.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>These add two extra challenges, but one thing to ease the pressure; however, in order to use that pressure release, you must fight more fiercely for the castles as they come out….

I like the new rules for these boards, but it is problematic to play a mix of these and the normal boards with new players:  Consistency is a good thing.  So, we tend to find ourselves all playing these or all playing the others.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.28

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is not for me.  It&#039;s an interesting marriage of 4-in-a-row on a 6×6 grid, with classic Yahtzee-style die rolling.  The trouble is that you are competing for positions, so those crappy rolls that are disappointing enough in Yahtzee are debilitating and depressing in Cuatro.  The bits are fantastic, but I don&#039;t understand why they didn&#039;t put an alternate board configuration on the backside of the gameboard.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>What is there to say?  It&#039;s a very pretty, but slightly less functional version of [thing=13]Settlers of Catan[/thing], with [thing=926]Cities &amp; Knights[/thing] thrown in, for good measure.  Having now played this with [thing=926]Cities &amp; Knights[/thing], I found the game quite a bit more fun, with what seemed like slightly better balance to the game.  Unfortunately, the brief instruction manual leaves a lot of questions unanswered for people new to the game.

The least functional bit are the docks:  The boats do not all perspicuously indicate which vertices have access to them, which is completely ridiculous when all they had to do was depict a wee dock coming off each corner.  This, to me, seems like a major flaw in an otherwise gorgeous re-production.</comment>				</item>

It also makes things just a smidgen more tedious, because of needing to know everyone&#039;s relative scores as they change.  Still, an interesting tweak to the game.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 9.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Nice puzzle game.  It plays like a Kamei puzzle box opens:  Sometimes you have to make what seems like regress in order to succeed.  In the case of [gameid=41800], it comes in the form of creatures breaking back into their hideouts in order to help others out.  My first game, the setup seemed to be a very unlikely one, with every cell&#039;s hideout being directly counterclockwise from it.  Still, it was solvable!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The offset Mongol and Chinese borders provides some unusual considerations when placing your buildings.  Although the mechanisms are quite different, and the dynamics differ, the feel of this game most reminds me of [thing=22198]The Great Wall of China[/thing], in that the players are jockeying for dominance in segments.  The action tiles in the style of traditional Chinese cards are a very nice production touch.
If you play this 2p, use the neutral blocks, or only play two boards.  Otherwise the wall will not finish.</comment>				</item>

The particular way in which the construction works, such that the first player to nab a public building hoses anyone else who may have been considering building it, doesn&#039;t delight me.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is a really cool abstract strategy game.  It uses dice as the pieces, taking advantage of the fact that they are dice (you can transfer pips between them — although I could see playing with Primordial Soup critters, instead), played on a hex grid that&#039;s on a projection of a cylinder with bouncy ends, and a magical piece splitter in the middle, which can bring eliminated pieces back into play.  The real genius of the game is that there is conservation of pips.  When a piece is captured, the pips must be absorbed by your weakest piece, which can really mess up your defensive plans.  The only downside is that as you get close to your demise, your pieces can&#039;t maneuver very well, due to the requirement of moving their full number of pips; on the other hand, it means the end comes quickly once the decline gets so far, because you lose when you can no longer find homes for all 25 pips (i.e. you only have 4 dice left).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Not so exciting as a four-player game, really.  There are some interesting strategies, to be sure, since you have to factor the die rolls into your decisions.  As your pieces get eliminated, you have more control, because when you roll a piece that was eliminated, you can choose to move another.  The fact of the matter is that the rajas can be struck pretty quickly, so this is probably best as a two-player game, lest half the players sit around watching the other half finish the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>This game has everything — well, almost everything — I hate in a game.

Try to build a perfect hand of seven cards of one suit (there are only two sets in each suit available), [thing=2093][/thing]-style, but your opponents can [i]take[/i] cards from your hand, and — worse — can [i]bust[/i] your hand, discarding as many of 6/7 of your cards at once.  :yuk:  Additionally, at the start of each player&#039;s turn, she rolls to see if she gets doubles, enabling her to be the [i]cheater[/i], allowing her to steal a card without needing to use a TAKE card, or to draw the top card of the discard (like you usually can in [thing=2093][/thing]), or to draw 2 cards (and discard 2) instead of 1.  As a bonus, if she&#039;s already the cheater, and rolls doubles, she ceases to be the cheater, and — my favorite :thumbsdown: game mechanims — loses her turn.</comment>	<conditiontext>Included in Slide 5 tin.</conditiontext>			<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 3.50

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>If I were to play this with someone who also has never studied the game, I would find it just a little less fun than [thing=2065]Shogi[/thing] or [thing=2393]Xiang Qi[/thing].  Those games have few or no pieces that can travel the length of the board in one move.  Having to check every bloody piece in [International] Chess wearies me a bit, and reduces my enjoyment of it.
Unfortunately, pretty much anybody I know who would want to play this with me has either studied it, or played it enough to completely guarantee their victory.  I don&#039;t mind losing, but I don&#039;t have much fun at abstract strategy games when the outcome is a foregone conclusion - yes, even if it were because I won every time.

Things I prefer about [thing=2065]Shogi[/thing] over Chess:
You only have to get your unit to the furthest third (rather than eighth) of the board to promote it.
You can promote every unit except the jeweled general (king), though whether you want to promote a unit will depend on the situation.
Rather than moving a unit, you can place a unit you captured on the board, in your employ.

Things I prefer about [thing=2393]Xiang Qi[/thing] over Chess:
Some of your units may not cross the river into enemy territory.
Three of your units, including the emperor, may not leave the 3×3 palace in the back middle of your territory.
The cannon can only capture by jumping over precisely one piece, which provides tricky ways to block its tricky attack.
Before any moves are made, pieces are already in threat of capture, making every move feel significant.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Take on the risks of running a Depression-era circus, complete with promising to pay your performers when you probably can&#039;t follow through….  There&#039;s something about this that has me hooked.  I think it&#039;s the solid thematic saturation into the mechanisms of the game.  In most games, I&#039;d be incredibly annoyed if I arrived at a place demanding something just in time for them to change their mind, but it makes sense on the rare occasion that it happens in [b]Circus Train[/b]: You got a postcard telling you, &quot;Hey, we want a circus to come to town!  With tigers and acrobats and clowns!&quot; but by the time you eventually get there, they&#039;re hungry for clowns, elephants, and a human cannonball.  …or perhaps you arrive to find the unemployed remains of a bankrupt circus that got there before you.</comment>				</item>

This is six rounds of intense struggle to control more and grow, while having cities strong in the amenities important to the whim of the populace, yet without outgrowing your food production capacity.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The rules omit a crucial facet:  How to eliminate the current king.  Without that trigger, you can only win the game by being the last player alive, which relies on the disgusting, safe-to-use Russian roulette rule that either eliminates a random player still in the game or does nothing.  With no way to kill the current king, all the guard fighting and wall breaking is pointless, because the guards only matter if the game ends due to death of the current king - which can&#039;t happen as written.
Worse:  I can&#039;t even come up with a way that the current king was supposed to be eliminated.  Playing a trilithon and revealing a card will never reveal the neutral color, uh, &#039;cause it doesn&#039;t appear on any cards.  I guess you could say that revealing another trilithon card kills the king.  That certainly seems like it would motivate people to try to have the upper hand before they start trying to eliminate players.  Yes, I think that&#039;s the only thing that makes sense, even though the written rules would have you eliminate the green player if a green trilithon card is revealed.
Playing with my stab at a regicide rule, the game turns into a mere spitefest, not much more to my tastes than the time-consuming Russian roulette of the rules as written, which create a slapfight that goes until everybody is shot with the Russian roulette gun.  ...but at least it would be higher than the [b][bgcolor=#ff0000]&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] this gets for being just broken - I&#039;d guess in the [b][bgcolor=#ff6699]&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b]-[b][bgcolor=#ff66cc]&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] range, which really is quite a bit better!</comment>				</item>

:colonist: The rules gave examples showing sensible ways to take notes.
:colonist: The component list cards showed the fives as red, rather than orange.
:colonist: The rules were twice as long and totally perspicuous.
:colonist: There were enough question cards for all the players, or note sheets that show what the questions are.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I like that the pieces are designed so that you can flip them the easy way, and it&#039;s the same effect as swinging them around 180° the hard way.  Once you force your solving to be methodical (for the easy side), this is pretty easy to tackle… which is why there&#039;s the hard side:  The easy side permits 6 positional combinations × 2³ flip combinations = 48 combinations; the hard side, 24 positional combinations × 2⁴ flip combinations = 384 combinations.  The hard puzzles are a good bit nastier.  :devil:</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 4.27

It doesn&#039;t feel silly, too short, etc. This is the only form in which this game makes sense, but it is totally worth playing. Innovative, clever, and suspenseful. Just beware that it can invite analysis paralysis (which is a good indicator that there is substance in this game).</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.00

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>There are a lot of really interesting things going on here.  The game length, however, suffers significantly for each new player involved, and also suffers a large hit during the trading.  I think both problems could be solved by employing timers.  You may want to use a longer timer for the new players, out of fairness, but ultimately, playing through the whole game is what best gives a new player the skills to navigate the Colosseum machine next time.

The dignitaries are an interesting lot, as they provide players some very opportunistic options, but the players must be careful not to let them mound up in front of one player&#039;s arena, lest that player get, say, four to six of them to attend a single event near the end of the game.

When my first game (5p) finally ended, I was fairly relieved to move on to another game, but within a few hours, I was already looking forward to trying to bend that Colosseum machine to my will better next time!

All in all, this is a very interesting game, which feels familiar yet fresh; however, the whole affair takes a healthy chunk of time (easily 3-4 hours!).  It doesn&#039;t feel like it takes quite that long, but it does still feel a smidgen too long for what transpires.

Unfortunately, I think that the small amount of luck, since it is the spine of the game, makes or breaks your attempt at victory.  Playing excellently does not necessarily get you a victory over someone who played fairly well, but got lucky breaks.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The train is awesome, if, in practice, a bit small for actually getting bits into and out of, if you are not a small child. The thematic aspects of the game work pretty nicely; however, the lack of control is not good. The card use and programming takes cues from both [thing=18]RoboRally[/thing] and [thing=49]Mamma Mia![/thing] / [thing=13530]Sole Mio![/thing], with a dash of deck-[-]building[/-]wrecking, yet ends up having the control in Mamma Mia! / Sole Mio!. It. Is. Not. Fun. To program your moves when it is literally impossible — even without opponents messing things up — to get anything or shoot anyone turn after turn. Give the players their whole deck, and force them to choose what&#039;s going into the discard, and this game would be at least a [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b]; as it is, I did not have fun, in spite of good company and cool bits.

I did not have high expectations for this game, because it had such an awesome (and gimmicky) look; however, it did not live up to even those fairly neutral expectations, for me. May you enjoy it anyway!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Although it has the usual deduction game problem that misinformation can wreck the game for you, the answers are graphically depicted, so it shouldn&#039;t happen as often.  In short, this game is very nice.  You can easily see the relatively clear paths through your opponent&#039;s ranks; if only you knew how your own agents move!  The Stronghold edition is very nicely made, maximizing the replay value with high-quality, fully incognito pieces, and five variants in the rulebook.  If you like abstract strategy games and deduction games, this should be a slam dunk for you.</comment>				</item>

Something about CotFL excites me into thinking a little tweak of a variant would make it a brilliant game.  Still, what&#039;s there is a card-driven, abstract strategy game.  Like with [thing=21882]Blue Moon City[/thing], having the bravery to cycle your cards to hunt for more useful ones can really pay off.  Unlike [thing=21882]BMC[/thing], though, you get back half as many cards as you cycle.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Due to nearly perfect, and very thorough iconography, and polished design that permits some simultaneous play, this game is fairly intuitive.  Combine that with its nice decisions and pleasant engine building, and you have a very solid combo.  The biggest downside is that due to the number of contract cards, it&#039;s possible to have consistently poor overlap of your production and contract demands.  There are things that mitigate that, but if one person gets stellar matches all game, and another gets poor matches all game, guess who&#039;s going to win.  Still, there is a lot of fun to be had in this game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Amazing:  Lift some core mechanisms from several of the biggest games of recent years, alter them a bit, introduce a sinister little mechanism, and somehow make a very streamlined product.  This really works quite well!  The card conveyor inspires your tactics for the turn, including how hard you fight for turn order.  That is a fight done by a forced sacrifice of 20% of your hand!  :thumbsup::yuk:  It&#039;s a discard that is even harder than the one in [thing=23205][/thing].  Of course, your deckbuilding feeds not only your bidding ability, but also your purchasing and point-snarfing abilities, and your worker placement potential.  It might sound like a cobbled-together mess, but it certainly doesn&#039;t feel that way.  The rules are simple* and flow well*, and this easy-to-learn* game is rather fun!

[size=7]* Except for the doubling caps, which I&#039;m still not completely confident I understand maximally.[/size]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 9.00

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>There are a lot of moving parts, which provides what feels like a steep learning curve.  The reality is that only one person needs to be intimately familiar with the game, as long as she successfully stresses to the newbies about using the lovely red Action cards and anything else they can to make the rolls that matter.  ...which might be a damage roll they&#039;re making on a successful hit.</comment>		<wantpartslist>10v1	Basilian Ossuary (Fallen Sanctuary: Site)

Although predominantly [thing=11330]Jass[/thing], it provides enough of its own spin that it is special.  The base game Eidex can easily be played with a standard deck of cards, but Abacus has provided gorgeous watercolor art that make this small deck worth owning.

You can use your spies to protect your king and/or assassins, but misdirection is also good.  In short, there are some interesting depths to this pleasantly unusual game.

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m itching to try different strategies, and playing the game in my head while away.  This needs to be published!

There are nice depths to this game to be explored.  The first play can be daunting, but its mechanisms do not pollute its theme.  For example, I love that when I gain three points, the world gains three points (except when self-serving cards are involved).  There&#039;s a certain beauty to it, and it conveys the message that when the world benefits, we benefit.</comment>				</item>

Unfortunately, playing the right tile at the wrong moment can give your opponents some great opportunities.  Fortunately, most of the time, you still have chances to undo the favor you&#039;ve done.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I really like the mechanisms, and how they reenact a dogfight.  Climb, climb, climb, all the while subtly trying to maneuver your opponent&#039;s planes into a potential crossfire… then SWOOP by, gunning them down, thanks to clever positioning of the other planes.

The configurable clouds, and varied rules for more than two players provide plenty of scenarios to try out.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>I am very excited about this game.  Its look suggests that it will be more like their last design, [thing=24480]The Pillars of the Earth[/thing], than it is - which believe it or not is a good thing.  Cuba feels very fresh and challenging, although many of the mechanisms are reminiscent of other games.  But that&#039;s the key: [thread=278686]many mechanisms[/thread].  I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve not yet made good use of the complex machinery of the game mechanisms, but it&#039;s very fun and challenging trying to plot a competitive course through them!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The first thing to observe about this expansion is that each player [b]will[/b] be taking 25% more actions - or at least close to it.  So, even if all the new dynamics could be considered in the same amount of time as the base game, you are still facing a game that is 25% longer.  In consideration of that, unless you specifically want to play a marathon game, you should choose to play only 6 rounds, rather than the 8 you could play with the new cards.  (Three experienced [gameid=30380] players took about [b]3 hours[/b] to play 8 rounds on their first go!)

Now, with those out of the way:  This is a very nice expansion.  The new ships, buildings, and bills provide some nice, new options.  The board matches with unbelievable precision to the base game&#039;s board.  Maybe I lucked out, but mine line up to a fraction of a millimeter, creating a combined board so visually seamless that people are surprised to discover that it&#039;s two boards.  That precision alone started to make me appreciate the painfully high price of the expansion.  I was surprised to read in the rules that one of my favorite tradeoff mechanisms of [gameid=30380] had been replaced in the expansion:  Turn order now works as it does in [gameid=24480], in that by default, start player will drift clockwise unless someone specifically takes an action to seize the start player marker.  As I explained the new rules, though, it clicked with me why that change had to be made.  Because you play a fifth action now by taking a Cuban card and using it, and you could do it as your final play in the round, people may have no votes in parliament on their last-played card.  Sure, it could be handled in the traditional [gameid=30380] way, but it comes down to this:  The new way works.  With the other added decisions, we didn&#039;t even feel like anything was missing.  ...and the Cuban cards bring with them another tradeoff:  The position of the card neglected by all players will be the action the [i]el presidente[/i] will execute.  So, you can only control what will [b]not[/b] happen to all players.  The nastiest of these is the action that passes [b]all four[/b] bills.

So, it comes down to the big question:  Is [gameid=40794] worth the money?  Is it worth 2/3 the price of the base game?  If you are a huge fan of [gameid=30380], and/or you want to add more variety to the game, [b]yes[/b].  Must you have [gameid=40794] in order to enjoy [gameid=30380]?  Certainly not, or you probably wouldn&#039;t be reading this.  Would you be better off buying a new game for that amount?  If it&#039;s a tried and true game that you know you like as much as [gameid=30380], then probably; otherwise, probably not.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Some interesting and unusual mechanisms here.  I suspect this game would be a full point better if automated (e.g. with online play).  It&#039;s easy for new players to spend the entire game forgetting at least one step of every turn.  Plus, there&#039;s a pretty healthy dose of &quot;a great tile turned up at the right time&quot; lending heavily to victory.  Still, an experienced player playing skillfully should prevail, and I am vaguely interested in exploring the game a little more.  I enjoy watching the mechanisms work, but I&#039;m not sure I enjoy having to turn every cog myself.  :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>2015-08-17: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] It&#039;s interesting to try to deduce the shifting field of information, but for my tastes, it can wear out its welcome waiting for a single player to hit the target number of &quot;wins&quot;. So, I doubt I&#039;ll suggest a proper full game any more, but it&#039;s a fun quickie!

2015-10-12: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] (instead of dropping to [b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4 [/bgcolor][/b]) Confirmed: As with Apples to Apples and Bomberman, set the goal lower (2 wins for a single player) and this game is done before it grows old. Now, instead of a tired, bitter aftertaste, I find a pleasant flavor in my mouth at game end.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.17

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>This is an astoundingly fun cooperative game for little kids.  Due to the way the cub (or mother) wanders, the excitement in the game automatically grows as the players get the gates closed:  At first, the tiger goes toward whichever of the three gates is rolled.  Strictly statistically, this means the tiger shouldn&#039;t deviate far from the center.  Once a gate is closed, however, the tiger is no longer tempted by that exit, giving it better odds of not backtracking.  Really, it&#039;s a brilliant mechanism for building the suspense up to the climactic, collaborative closing of the third gate, or escape of the tiger mom, looking for her baby.

2 years old: We played (and won, barely) a full game!  They were able to play by the rules with some help, and identified the colors, and counted the pips and spaces.  They also narrated the goings on, and kept helping the baby tiger find its mama....  :^)</comment>				</item>

You very likely should bank on at least 5 of those. Good solitaire experience, but my score will be much better once I consider that strategic note above….</comment>				</item>

As to the game itself:  It&#039;s a pretty fun, quick miniatures battle with the odd factor that your units arrive on the scene with a random amount of damage.  ...and moving adds or removes damage.  Thematically, it&#039;s very strange, but I console myself by thinking about how accurately that portrays some of the surprising occurrences in skirmishes in SAiS, such as a unit&#039;s shielding coming back online just in time to save its skin, or critical hits to systems.  Basically, it works out, and it&#039;s fairly fun.  If this were more than a 15-30 minute game, this innovative mechanism would blow, because it induces all sorts of &quot;random&quot; situations on the battlefield.

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Twisted, sick game of trying to control areas with colors of demons who have limited positions in which they can play.  Ghosts not only lock areas, but also gain points for the areas they lock.  The most demented part of the game, however, is having to publicly predict the outcome precisely once during the game.  Once you&#039;ve done this, everyone will happily thwart you if possible; however, you also need to predict early enough that you can be sure you can influence the outcome to match your prediction.The arbitrary layout of the strings, representing the energy lines, helps increase variabilty in replaying the game.
Best of all is that you probably have everything you need to play the game!</comment>	<conditiontext>home-made</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Exploration creates the map anew each game, and you gamble in choosing whether to establish your presence on an island now, or continue exploring.  The battle for the produce (ignoring the illogic of all islands&#039; scouts going for the same goods, or perhaps just thinking of it as metaphorical ;^) is often strange and suspenseful.</comment>	<conditiontext>Die Neuen Entdecker</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>86</numplays>			<comment>This game depends heavily on gambling on die probability distributions.  Nonetheless, there is something appealing about it.  The configurability of the game is probably its strongest trait.  My main problem with it is that after a certain point in the game, I really don&#039;t care what happens most turns, because I can&#039;t do anything - especially if I&#039;m on the verge of winning.  (And you&#039;d think that&#039;s because people won&#039;t trade with me, but oddly, the problem is just that the other people take exponentially longer, the closer someone is to winning.</comment>	<conditiontext>Die Siedler von Catan</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is an interesting mix of hardcore strategy with serious gambling.  Losing two units at once to continental drift is harsh, for example, but it also forces the players to think much more flexibly.  As with any changing environment, you could just play tactically, but a strong strategy that capitalizes on those tactical opportunities generally will prevail.</comment>				</item>

Its map is three separate boards that nestle together nicely.  The cover is very slightly convex, which I presume is because a previous owner didn&#039;t support the game&#039;s &quot;belly&quot; properly on the shelf.  Unbelievably good shape for a game from 1976.  My copy, actually:

Having played, I can say that as in Vino, you quickly start to get a feel for where you should play and where you shouldn&#039;t - with some margin of error, of course.  This is a rather interesting game, and obviously Goldsieber&#039;s production of it is gorgeous.</comment>	<conditiontext>Very good

What&#039;s interesting about this game is that it introduces kids to &quot;things falling&quot; dexterity games with no real consequences for the players.  Basically, this game is good training for turn-taking, moving things with care, and (possibly) helping animals.</comment>				</item>

Parts of it reminded me of numerous other games (the card-drawing choices of [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing], and the region expansion of [thing=12632]Goldbrãu[/thing], to name two that jump to mind), and it&#039;s a little tricky at first to understand which things give you victory points versus income; however, it was interesting to play, and pulling up from behind generally means pulling down those in the lead, which, in our case, meant a very close game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>239</numplays>			<comment>When it was a prototype under playtesting and development:  Can&#039;t say too much yet, but constructing a deck for maximal efficiency as you play is challenging and addicting.  It&#039;s easy to find yourself playing this several times in a row.

Now:  This game provides interesting choices and balance as you build a CCG-style deck on the fly, with victory points acting as dead weight in the deck.  Brilliant!

	<numplays>23</numplays>			<comment>The &quot;overpay&quot; triggers, and the spendable coins add some interesting dynamics to the game.  The overpayment veers the series probably the closest to its Magic: The Gathering ancestry as any mechanism in it has, but it can lead to some wickedly rewarding combos with other Guilds cards.

	<numplays>158</numplays>			<comment>It is quite solid, of course, with plenty of options to get your mind racing all over again!  The number of &quot;one type of action card&quot; strategies in [gameid=40834] is greatly reduced, and those that are there are less obvious.  I really like the card interaction and combos provided by the greater number of multi-type cards in [gameid=40834]!

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s fun, but the rules have at least two big holes, even with all that text on the card:
:colonist: Must you use the card on it?  The wording doesn&#039;t imply that it&#039;s optional.
:colonist: What happens if you forget to trigger the action stowed on the Prince?
:colonist: What happens to the Prince if you fail to return the action to it?  Does it go into your discard?  Doesn&#039;t say it does, but paying 8 for something you might completely and permanently fail to use on the first try doesn&#039;t seem right.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>149</numplays>			<comment>[i]Early impressions:[/i] The play is a bit more convoluted and complex, which means the downtime is significantly higher.  Yes, you can actually shuffle your deck before your turn!  In fact, you can have to wait.  ...even in a 2p game.  :(

The combos and card interaction are very interesting, though, which leaves you still with a very good game.

[b]Important[/b]: To play with only [thing=51811][/thing] kingdom cards is to torment oneself, if you&#039;re new to the set.  This is an expansion.  Treat it as such by mixing it in with other Dominion stuff!

[i]Current impressions:[/i] This has really grown on me, and I love flexing the Duration cards.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This delightfully well-planned game gives both the Seuss buff and the naïve a decent chance of winning and losing, due to some perspicacious design:  There are questions, sometimes ludicrous, about pictures of scenes from a Seuss book (e.g. How many eyes were visible?), which require no previous Seuss familiarity.  Additionally, each player is secretly given a &quot;book&quot; at the beginning, and any time someone moves beyond your book&#039;s space on the board, you may opt to surrender your book to trade places with that poor sap.  On the other hand, there is still plenty of reward for the Seuss expert.  I am very impressed with how universally playable this game has been.</comment>				</item>

The kids will look disturbingly like his characters as they tiptoe with a rake on their head, or whatnot.  The only choice for the players is whether they think they can perform a task.  Otherwise, it&#039;s a dexterity game.  I have to say that crawling whilst holding a plastic figurine under your chin is not so easy....</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Other than the severe cuteness of this game, it doesn&#039;t do much for me.

Age 1:  My one-year-old kids have a blast with it.  The karate-worthy shout my son gives when throwing the die is pricelessly entertaining.

Age 2:  They still have about the same amount of fun with this.  It&#039;s still a toy, primarily, and a book to read.

Age 10: They wanted to read and play this for old time&#039;s sake, and neither one was satisfied with a single play. The choices in the original edition are pretty superfluous, and there is a fair chance that a die roll is useless (e.g. there&#039;s no cheese to pursue, so who cares?). Interestingly, I see that the 2014 edition added a third and fourth color (100% more!) to the die and the house, which should make the choices a little more meaningful; however, I&#039;m betting you still have the no-cheese-down, useless rolls. Also strange, the new edition has art not by the original author/illustrator/designer. It is very cute, but I was surprised, because the cuteness of the game/book is what drew me in the first place.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>2010-05-26: I like some of the notions, but for me, it was [thing=875]Roads &amp; Boats[/thing] with all the joy sucked out of it.  But with a configurable transport that could be wound, and wound, and wound, and then turned loose with wads of potential energy stored up, which was a very interesting concept.  You get to play chicken to accomplish as much as you can on your turn, yet without yielding too much advantage by letting others claim things before you can get there.

2011-09-30: I want to try this again sometime, in a more optimal setting.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This has got to be the single most difficult dexterity game I have every played. How to summarize… OK. Cross the skillful propelling of cubic dice from [thing=16747][/thing] with dungeon crawl and targeting of [thing=57390]Catac[/thing]— no, that&#039;s not right. Well, I&#039;ll just say that it is very warped, and you&#039;d better practice using your &quot;weapons&quot; (the RGB dice) before you play. Then you might survive the first foe.

This is a quick and painful game, but in a fun way.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 4.00

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>From a first playing, against a very experienced player:  [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff]&amp;nbsp;5.5&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b]  An analytical game which favors experience, but I think there&#039;s a decent game formula at work.  I&#039;m anxious to increase my rating. :^)

Having played on a more level playing field, this is interesting, and very tactical; however, you will fail if you don&#039;t think strategically as well.  I look forward to more twisting!</comment>	<conditiontext>Thanks, Stephan!</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>You have three decisions to make each round of play (note that I didn&#039;t say each turn, but rather each round):  Whom will you hire?  Where will you send your party?  When will you stop exploring?  There you go:  That&#039;s about as much information you have in the game to feed into your decisions.  Oh!  Since you win by having 7 deaths in your dungeon, and which dungeon is yours is secret, you win completely by accident. (Just like with [thing=258]Fluxx[/thing]!  Wow!)  Well, there is a second way you can work toward victory, which is sending your party to hack on another player&#039;s party.  Then you get to play War with your three-card party, and it&#039;s pretty obvious who&#039;s going to win that before you start, since your party is face-up at all other times, so the only player who&#039;s going to bother with that is the one who was lucky enough to to stumble through a long stretch of imaginary dungeon, get a lot of cash, and buy the expensive characters, with nobody else getting any good ones.  Doesn&#039;t it just sound like a hoot?  (Now, in fairness, I think someone could take the description on the back of the box and create a pretty interesting game in that framework.)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>This is a great abstract strategy game, with plenty to ponder, yet still potentially very quick turns. According to our play stats, it&#039;s about 15 minutes per player. The modular board setup is very robust: Choke points matter, but are not completely game defining, so while a dense setup of the tiles is guaranteed to work, you really can lay it out randomly, as long as all the movement spaces form a contiguous group. The variability of the modular layout coupled with the random setup (honestly, we randomly set up the map, too) does wonders for the replayability and addiction factor. Additionally, your options on your turn create a sufficiently dynamic environment that even with a static map and a fixed setup, I think there would still be a good game here.

[b]2p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b]
[b]3p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] I was shocked to see that it really does work great with 3. Yes, 2 people can gang up on the other, but the only really viable collusion strategy is eliminating the target from the game. Then, it&#039;s just a 2-player game, and neither of the schemers can afford to let the other get the upper hand while bashing on player 3. The balance of the game&#039;s mechanisms does wonders to make this work multi-player. The true limiting factor is that the number of stacks you have in play can only decrease (or hold steady), so an alliance to erode a player can be effective, but that player quickly gains access to double-turns (via [i]forced march[/i]) as a result. OK, I admit that I was the outcast player, and I managed to squeak out a win by points (and capital-control) with a single disc left on the board, at the very last opportunity. :D</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.50

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m confident that the key to maximizing enjoyment of [gameid=30102] is to have players of comparable attention, determination, and skill.  You could all play very lightly, or all quite strategically; however, if all but one player plays strategically, you get the player-to-the-left-of-the-slacker-wins syndrome.

This is a tense, fun game, fairly quick to play and slightly nerve wracking.  If one player hands another a lot of points, it can be frustrating (even if it was you who did it), but solid strategy and preparation ought to get the win more often than not anyway.  ...just not 100% of the time, nor probably even 90% of the time....</comment>	<conditiontext>Color laser printed on 110# card stock from files Victor Melo sent me.</conditiontext>			</item>

I prefer some of the aspects of [thing=229]King of the Elves[/thing], and others of Elfenland.  They&#039;re each good in their own way.  Remaining aware that you could get a horrid assortment of cards for a turn will help you remember to give yourself a buffer zone, so you aren&#039;t sunk if that occurs.  If, however, you get four sets of cards that are highly disagreeable with the board layout around you each turn, then you can just have a bad, unfun game of it.  Fortunately, I think the number of options you have in the travel network help mitigate such misfortunes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The feature I wrote off at first as something to try eventually, is probably my favorite feature:  The Scenario cards.  Until just before we played, I somehow hadn&#039;t realized that each person gets their own Scenario, which tells you what your starting deck composition is, gives you a technology card or two, and specifies your starting planet.  This really mixes things up nicely, pointing you toward a strategic path right at the start of the game.

I had been worried that this expansion would introduce a ton of direct conflict, and turn everyone off; however, my remote hope was true:  You choose whether to turn to the dark side — er, I mean go down the path of gunning down your mates&#039; work.

Big, big bonus points that the expansion box fits within the base game box, with all bits present in both.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>TMG confesses they didn&#039;t playtest these with the usual thoroughness, and I have quickly found that certain ones should be ejected from play if certain scenario cards are on the table.  e.g. A.I. provides far, far too quick a path to a Military Victory.  The planets seem fine, though.  ;)

[b]Update:[/b] Military victory is not as easy to achieve as my conqueror thought:  You can only have one physical battlecruiser in play, so you must employ technology in order to pull it off….</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I really like it.  With five players, it&#039;s possible for one person to win with several people having attracted no emiras, but that is a consequence of reducing the requirements to keep the game a reasonable length with five.  This game has plenty of the delightful agony of wanting to do everything on your turn, but being quite limited.  The biggest problem I have with the game is that somehow, as interesting as it is, it doesn&#039;t flow smoothly:  At nearly any point in a turn, you might find yourself asking about the turn sequence, &quot;Where are we?&quot;  I think that if that rough edge could be sanded down, the game would go much faster.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I [b]really[/b] like the puzzles, some of which are surprisingly difficult. [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] for those.

A completed puzzle pretty much becomes a [thing=822][/thing] tile that you can place, for non-exclusive point-grubbing.  Unfortunately, the layout isn&#039;t great for perceiving the points or the paths — it&#039;s actually pretty darn bad for seeing the paths.  [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] for this Carcassonnesque part.

The start player role rotates around the table, and players choose their puzzles in player order.  That means you are guaranteed to get your pick of preferred puzzle type once each round.  Unfortunately, this means that with four players, the last in turn order just gets what she gets, for better or worse.  Unfortunately, this also decides which circuit piece you&#039;re trying to place, and this is where it bites.  At worst, it&#039;s effectively the same as Carcassonne, in that you get whatever tile and place it, but somehow it feels a little annoying in this game.  [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b]

Overall, I loved the puzzles enough that I want to play more, and I&#039;m tempted to buy it….</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 7.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A vicious, pure, simple abstract strategy game, in which every move has brutal implications.  It strikes me as one which doesn&#039;t conceal much mystery, despite the very interesting &quot;phalanx&quot; movement mechanism.  Also, though I like the elegance and fairness of the victory condition, in practice, it turns into attrition or surrender (or idiotic forgetfulness), neither of which is particularly pleasurable or painless for the loser.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>There are plenty of interesting choices to make, and I really like how the tradeoff mechanisms keep you in play, even if things may not be going exactly how you had intended; however, the monsters in triplicate, which form the &quot;game timer&quot; Monster deck, really should be in duplicate, or possibly even just one of each, because the game just lasts too darn long. (Make sure you remember to discard a monster each time a hero is fully rested, but the game still needs a trim.)</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 8.00

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Very cool game mechanism, this Esagek.

[b]Alone[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] — An interesting twist (no pun intended) on the classic peg solitaire, especially by making the twisting action mandatory each turn.  The required cadence is [i]twist[/i], [i]capture[/i], [i]twist[/i], [i]capture[/i], etc.

[b]Classic[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] — Although on the surface it seems like a basic [thing=2386][/thing] derivative, the [thing=25246][/thing] spin on things makes it the best of the four games.  This is the only game in which you need to try to sneak past each other, yet captures are still allowed.  Yes, you can use the multijump of [thing=2386][/thing], but you are capturing along the way, both reducing your opponent&#039;s chances and your jumping opportunities — on the other hand, you&#039;re also clearing a safe path....

[b]Surrounder[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] — Tricky abstract strategy game that turns into a bash-the-later-players fest with a lot of players.

[b]Invasion[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] — With two players, this is a pleasant struggle for a majority in the middle.  I&#039;m not sure how this would be fore more players.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is a descendent of chess, on the &quot;piece&#039;s move is defined by the space it&#039;s in&quot; side of the family; however, the replay value is very good in this one, due to the configurable board.  Another big win for it is that rather than losing the game by having your king captured, you lose the game one of two ways:  Having an essence spring you control captured, or controlling zero essence springs.  This leads to interesting tactics.</comment>				</item>

With the very small deck of cards, if you have a good hand (i.e. fairly homogenous), then your opponents are more likely to have them as well.  It&#039;s better than not playing anything, but I just don&#039;t find it particularly enriching, challenging, or satisfying. </comment>	<conditiontext>Standard deck of cards.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>First impression: I really wasn&#039;t sure enough how I felt about this to rate it, but I want to capture my initial thoughts about it.  It has some very interesting mechanisms that (for me) didn&#039;t gel into an interesting game.
Strike 1: The dystopian theme puts me off, which I could ignore if the rest of the game is worth it.
Strike 2: The way the dice actually worked didn&#039;t thrill me.
Strike 3: The engine building seems like it will give good replay value, but can produce very lopsided play experiences.  In the long run, I&#039;m sure this is a great feature if you really dig the game.

This sounds pretty damning, but the respectable elements of the game keep it in an &quot;I&#039;d play it another time or two&quot; zone.  With luck, I&#039;d end up really digging it.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.00

Also, it plays in about half the time, and is a little more portable.  So, now you can choose the appropriate representation of the Tigris and the Euphrates for your time constraints!  (Or, you could just play the land between them in [thing=19301]Mesopotamia[/thing].  Better still, play [thing=42]E&amp;T[/thing] on one side, [thing=19419]E&amp;T:WdK[/thing] on the other, and [thing=19301]M[/thing] in the middle!  Of course, that&#039;s 3 hours of games, but it&#039;s all in that same, fertile crescent!)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Wow, what a just-useful-enough-to-be-obstructive set of rules.  The language is fine, but there are certain vague bits, and bits that sound contradictory.  There&#039;s no handy summary telling you to what each term refers.  It was downright painful getting through the first game.  Enough about that.  How is the game?

At first, you are rather at the mercy of the dice.  Once you start establishing some agents, or getting opportunities for rerouting, you can start making more interesting strategic decisions.  I [-]hope to rewrite[/-] have [-]mostly[/-] rewritten the rules as a public service, because this game may be able to be 1-2 rating points higher if it were explained succinctly.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Lynne</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>2010-05-26: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] As in [thing=528][/thing], in Exxit you try trap your opponent into mandatory moves that work out to your advantage.  In this case, however, your advantage comes from having pieces thrown overboard, adjacent to two hexes, but with no moves that are mandatory for you.  Exxit is a good, mind-bending abstract strategy game that [person=6083]Vincent Everaert[/person] could have slipped into [family=10][/family] without anyone but [person=6083]Vincent[/person] and [person=244]Kris[/person] being any the wiser.

2014-12-29: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] I take back what I said about [family=10][/family]: This game is too challenging to steer for it to fit in that accessible family, but you can feel a few comparisons on the fringe as you dance and create, and most of all, manipulate.

To explain things backward, on your turn…
:d6-3: You must pass only if you can&#039;t do either of the following two actions.
:d6-2: You must &quot;construct the world&quot; if you can and only if you can&#039;t do the following action.
:d6-1: You must do a &quot;destruction dance&quot; if you can.

The points you score at the end of the game are based on that second &quot;option&quot;, so everything hinges on manipulating the situation (and your opponent) so your turn comes around with you unable to dance, but able to construct.

It&#039;s really, really hard to explain, but by the time you&#039;re ⅔ through your first game, you will see why this belongs on this list, at least for chain[u]s[/u] of constraints.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This game serves merely to ease people into the [gameid=2142], and it shows:  It&#039;s a roll-and-move abstract strategy, but due to the nature of the rolling and moving, there&#039;s a 25% chance that the second player won&#039;t have a first move.  Yes, it does get you GRYBbing fairly quickly, but I&#039;d skip this and go straight for [gameid=47470].  ([gameid=47471] may be too much of a paradigm shift for your first game with the [gameid=2142].)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This realtime game always sounds like a fun and great concept, but the players never seem to enjoy it much.  Perhaps it&#039;s a game that needs to be played regularly, so it can be automatic and the focus can be on the frenzy.  Perhaps it needs to be played while inebriated.  Perhaps the people with whom I&#039;ve played just haven&#039;t been resilient enough.  Perhaps I shouldn&#039;t be the dealer.  ;^D
Nonetheless, I always feel like there&#039;s a burst of fun waiting inside this packet, yet undiscovered in my life.  I&#039;ll keep hoping....</comment>				</item>

The character colors and abilities are congruent with the [family=5132]preceding games[/family], so it&#039;s easy on fans of the series.

Fortunately, we got to play on the altered version of the board, which, we were told, was quite an improvement.  I certainly enjoyed the game!  I wanted to play it several more times, but then there was that stack of other games Tom had brought for the Wham-a-thon....  ...and the next year, I &quot;wasted&quot; the opportunity to play Felithian Factories because the allure of Felithian Finance was just too strong....</comment>				</item>

Now: How I could overlook the same sentence every time I read the rules is beyond me.  Playing with the limitation that you can only add firefighters to a hex if it will not put more firefighters in there than there are free sides on the hex... well, it&#039;s an enormous difference.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m really not sure how I feel about this yet.  I like a lot of the mechanisms, and I love the way acquiring a location provides you with resources, but increases your logistical difficulties.  It feels right; it makes sense.  What I dislike is that you can founder pretty thoroughly if you get inundated with &quot;the wrong cards&quot;.  Unlike the [family=50][/family] games, there usually are useful things to do with the cards, unless you&#039;ve snagged a bunch of locations willy-nilly, with no regard for their function.  Certainly, knowing the environment of the conflict enables you to dominate the situation over someone who doesn&#039;t.

Oh, and I also adore that the sieges are vaguely like [thing=9446][/thing], rather than anything involving dice.  You can still score a lucky win, but it&#039;s more likely if you&#039;ve managed your deck (your attention to that which you rule) well.</comment>	<conditiontext>#746/1000</conditiontext>			<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.67

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I really like the mechanisms to determine the goals for the round and the tools that will allow you to strive for those goals.  In practice, I really dislike the ties-cancel-each-other mechanism that affects every play of the game, which enabled me to have both the most and the least of a color at the same time.  It&#039;s zany, yes, but it turns the game into a crapshoot.  The choices for shrunken heads are good for a chuckle.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[b]Tindahan[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b]  This was kind of interesting.  The choices presented are some nice fresh options for play; however, I&#039;m not sure I like knowing every single card that&#039;s in play.  I&#039;d prefer having a few cards out of play each round.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>2004-04: [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] This is a really novel game concept.  Fairly fun, with lots of risk (and luck) considerations.

2011-09-10: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] The above comments are still true; however, I would like to add that the luck is pretty harsh in this game.  It&#039;s still a great concept worth revisiting and updating….</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Tentative rating from one play.  In truth, it&#039;s somewhere in the range [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] – [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b], but I don&#039;t yet know where.  The game suffers at the beginning from the late-game problem Caylus has: scads of bits of various colors all over the bloody board.  …but there are myriad point sources, so there&#039;s plenty to pursue here.  That first game, I was sure I was a solid fourth place, but I ended up winning by 1 point. Interestingly, had it not been for 20 points that I had assumed were off the table when I stopped collecting viziers at 3, I actually would have been last.

So, it may be brilliant, but it certainly is at least good.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 7.67

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The first edition has employed too subdued a palette for depicting the cubes, and there&#039;s a lot of information to scan and consider each turn, especially considering the frequency with which someone can beat you to the punch.  That stated, there is a lot to like here, plenty to keep your gears turning.  It&#039;s in the same vein as Caylus, but they are quite distinct games — to the extent that I probably could contentedly play one after the other, without wavering from my predisposition toward variety.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.60

This game is tactical in the same sense as Dragon&#039;s Lair:  Wait for just the right moment, then hit your sword button, or move left, or whatever, then see if that was the right thing at that moment....  Newbies  love  it, though, which really makes the experience much more enjoyable.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>This is a very cleverly designed game with sneaky subtleties.  You have goals which are somewhat in conflict with each other, making each turn suspenseful, as you try to dominate enough rows - all the while trying to form scoring patterns, which of course is more easily done by risking not dominating the rows.  It&#039;s games like this that start bad habits like nail-biting!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>[b]Finally[/b], I have played this.  It strangely reminds me of the feeling of playing Baby Pac-Man: You play one game (the deckbuilding) that more or less drives the other (the tactical).  What really matters is the maneuvering on the board, but the deckbuilding provides units, gives them movement advantages, protection, etc. and really adds layers to the decision-making.  Better still, each card has two effects between which you must choose, and with extremely few exceptions (to be found in expansions), training a unit in order to make it available in your barracks to deploy later means trashing the training card.  Sure, sure, makes sense, can&#039;t just keep training the same type of unit, but you also throw away a potent action or order or treasure effect with it, and the former two tend to pertain to that class of unit.  So many decisions!  Yay!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The new starting cards are very nice.  Much to my surprise, though, the four-player [team] variant that is the heart of this expansion is… pretty much perfect.  The two allies share all sovereign units, but Ally A can&#039;t move a sovereign if Ally B just moved that one.  Nothing else, other than a goal, do the allies share.  The square pieces allow you to keep track of whose pieces are whose; however, to a casual onlooker, it just looks like you stuck the pieces on the board oriented randomly, with no regard to proper decorum.

Part of what makes the 4p variant work so well is the fact that there are two different [identical] supplies, one between each pair of enemies.  This keeps the competition for cards feeling even tighter than it does in the base game.  Do not fear this variant.  Over the years, so many 4-player chess variants have been created, but the first one that really feels right, right, right is not merely a mutant clone of chess, but the legitimate offspring of chess and Dominion.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Interesting mechanisms advance or wreck your cars in this odd little race game that actually feels kind of right.  It&#039;s interesting to watch it play out, and your tactical choices are unusual; however, in replicating the suspense of the race, the players&#039; cards are mostly tossed about by the effects of the cards.  In other words, interesting to watch while you play, but you aren&#039;t doing as much playing as watching, even on your own turn.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s on a featureless 8×8 board (64 unobstructed spaces) versus [gameid=51]&#039;s 16×16 board with pre-printed walls, reflectors, and such (256 tricky spaces).  This makes [gameid=39845]&#039;s solutions much easier to find; however, because the cheese acts as the obstructions, as the game progresses, you have fewer ways to maneuver the mice to the selected cheese.  The rules address this, and suggest a variant in which you score but do not extract the cheese.  I guess the mice just nibble.

This is [gameid=51]&#039;s little sibling.  If you like speed puzzle games, you should enjoy this.  If you occasionally found it hard to keep a mental queue of the solutions, you may prefer [gameid=39845].</comment>				</item>

The invaders are a bit like the big nasties in [thing=82381][/thing] or [thing=77318][/thing]:  Unless you don&#039;t meet them until you&#039;re quite upgraded, you&#039;re dead.  Unlike those two, you must make periodic payments on your ship, or it&#039;s game over.  Also unlike those, you can&#039;t run from the big nasties until they get a hit on you.  In short, it&#039;s decent enough if you like that sort of game, but I have much more satisfying solitaire games to play.  I prefer cumulatively meaningful decisions; this one&#039;s pretty much tactical.  Buy stuff, pick a profitable target planet you can reach, sell stuff if you survive, upgrade if you can afford to.  ...although I must confess that I&#039;m tempted to play it some more, thinking I could do better....</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 6.75

2011-01-05: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] Like everyone&#039;s already saying, play this game with the three included &quot;expansion modules&quot;.  In fact, playing with [thing=86048]The Scrolls[/thing] is even better.  The &quot;expansion modules&quot; add negligible complexity to the rules, but enhance the decision space significantly.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The tradition for [thing=66188][/thing] continues:  Having numerous expansions in the game adds that modicum of additional complexity that makes it a really good game.

[b]4. The Wishing Well[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] This doesn&#039;t add anything thrilling to the game, other than nice bits (the watery side of the sunken coins is a delightful touch); it mainly adds a smidgen of innocuous randomness, but moreover, additional motivation to get up earlier, which is interesting.

[b]5. The Gold Leaf[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] An additional element of timing your strikes is introduced with the gold leaf.  This is a fairly unobtrusive way to vie for more bonus points from the bishop.  Again, great bits, though.

[b]6. The Glaziers[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] As the rumored name for this expansion suggests, [u]this[/u] is the focus of this expansion box.  You effectively get two extra apprentices to use for glass shopping, but all that glass collecting keeps your purse emptier than ever, which is brilliant.  This alters the cadence of the game to a different rhythm, but I rather enjoyed the additional challenge.

[b][i]The additional stuff[/i][/b] [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] The money board is helpful, and prevented me from getting a bowl out for the money for once.  The paint pots, though, [b]delight[/b] me.  That&#039;s a lot of bowls I didn&#039;t need to get out, which saved me a lot of space.  I adore that the board is double-thick to allow the pots to contain the paint cubes nicely.  ...and the lids for pink and brown, although I&#039;ll never use them during the game for anything but covering two unused spaces in the workshop, are... the... best.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 9.25

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>First off, the action-blocking choices you have to make in these three expansions are an excellent new feature.  I love these sorts of tradeoffs in games!

[b]8. The Bells[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] This meeple-free action is very appealing, and is perhaps too distracting from other scoring opportunities.  The rules for it are very simple, so there is no reason not to include it every game.

[b]9. The Wall Fresco[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] Another very simple set of rules, even though it introduces a new action type at the color-mixer.  In fact, I&#039;m not convinced that this really adds anything noteworthy, but it is nice to be able to toss a single secondary-color cube for four points, and the paint income from it is [b]very[/b] nice.  Again, include it every time, even if it doesn&#039;t really add anything that feels fresh (other than the requirement to paint contiguously — meh).

[b]10. The Medico[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] This is the star expansion of this box.  Yes, the randomness of sickness can be cruel, but it&#039;s thematic; it&#039;s furthermore great, because it forces you to adjust your strategy on the fly, due to the limitations of virulent assistants.

I can&#039;t state this enough times:  Having to choose where to override other action options with the Bell audience or the Wall Fresco action is an excellent contribution to the game.  With all three of these modules (and with The Glaziery, M6) you must agonize about just how late on your board you can get away with sticking that non-Medico overlay, without someone beating you to the punch.  So much suspense has been added to the &quot;programming&quot; phase!  The bits aren&#039;t as ludicrously nice as they were in [thing=85925]4, 5, and 6[/thing], but the impact on gameplay is overall more memorable and worthwhile, without too much rules complexity.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>NULL</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Although at first glance, I was unimpressed by this expansion, I really like what it does for the game:  It gives players differing, but overlapping strategic paths to pursue right from start of the game.  It also adds an element of &quot;chicken&quot; to the game, as you push your luck by waiting as late in the game as you can to cash in your scrolls, but you don&#039;t want to miss the opportunity altogether!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Once you understand a couple of things about this game, your turns are all about competing for the resources you need.  What are those things?
1. Don&#039;t just sloppily gather gems.  Have one or more specific settings in mind before you go mining.
2. Your opponent can only thieve from you if she has a dwarf outside the mine, has a thief card, uses the thief action, and you have gems just lying around in your workshop.  In other words, try to situate yourself to get the gems home and commit them to a setting in the same turn.  If you don&#039;t let them languish, they can&#039;t be stolen.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>First impression:  This is a very dynamic deckbuilding game, which like [thing=11][/thing] has an ever-changing deck, based on what is pulled out of play.  The deck of challenges you face is increasingly thinned as you cull the good cards for &quot;your&quot; deck, but the faster you cycle through that deck, the faster the difficulty rises, and the sooner you have to face pirates.  Stripping your deck down to a lean machine means you cycle through it faster, and each iteration adds a horrific Aging Card to your deck.  Fascinating stuff.

Upon further play: Choosing your combos, and gauging your odds really make this very cleverly designed game.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The mechanisms of this game, oddly enough, remind me of Button Men (skill attacks and speed attacks).  The art and spells are pleasant and amusing; however, about the time I get into the game, it&#039;s over.  The other big detriment that comes with that is that the power cards, which are nearly the only way to score, are few enough in number that games usually don&#039;t feel like close races.  This may sound silly, but I think an expansion set with perhaps twice as many cards as the original game would greatly improve the game.  As it is, however, it&#039;s a highly opportunistic game, and you really haven&#039;t much control over your success; and only with great inattention can you control your failure.</comment>				</item>

Without Maura&#039;s great illustrations, this game would be little more than an amusing, though well-balanced concept.  So, Maura, those &quot;never again&quot; 140 illustrations were worth it.  You took the game from amusing to hilarious!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is kind of a fascinating, fairly abstract strategy game, with odd and interesting chaotic elements thrown in.  I kind of like that the teleporting stop signs force the players to think more laterally.  It is also interesting strategically to determine when you want to start targeting the conditions of certain species cards - whether you have control of them yet or not - and when you want to try to get them.  Certainly it seems that whoever gets the military edge first needs to be challenged quickly, primarily by others building their military presence, as well.  Starting with colonies definitely seems to be disadvantageous.

I respect several of the mechanisms in the game, and appreciate the component quality.  I&#039;m kind of intrigued and want to know the game better, but I didn&#039;t exactly adore it either, so with options more to my taste available, I doubt I&#039;d ever choose this over them.

If you like almost chess-like planning that can be inconvenienced by a die roll that happens after your move and/or build, and disrupted by probably-infrequent card play, [gameid=41032] is for you - particularly if you dig science fiction themes, and the ability for players to gain (and lose) victory point conditions.  Strategy is not obvious, and there are enough cogs in the scoring mechanisms to keep it interesting.

I think this would be interesting to play as a computerized implementation that scores on the fly.  I think the nobody builds anything end-game trigger would be slightly easier to take advantage of; however, a determined player still would always keep the game going for everyone - both for the winner and people who have no hope of catching up.  I think a better end-game trigger would be to say that each time someone declines to build, a Pass token is put beside the playfield, and once there are as many Pass tokens as players, the game ends.

Another variant I think would improve the game is to use a modification of Gláucio&#039;s variant:  Each player has three small selector cards depicting the three different faces of the die.  After your move/build, you [b]choose[/b] whether to use one of those cards or roll the die.  If you use a card, flip it face-down, unavailable for reuse until all three are face-down.

Oh, big warning:  The vernacular of the instructions ([i]sectors[/i], [i]systems[/i], etc.) gets in the way of the rules making sense.  You can facilitate comprehending the rules by highlighting the word [i]sector[/i] everywhere in one color, and highlighting [i]system[/i] everywhere in another color before you even read one sentence.  It wouldn&#039;t hurt to also highlight [i]colonies[/i] in red/pink, [i]bases[/i] in blue, and [i]installations[/i] in purple (or some other colors such that [i]X[/i]+[i]Y[/i]=[i]Z[/i])</comment>				</item>

Underestimating the devastation power of the weeds can kill you:  Weeds unchecked keep doubling.  This is a rather good game.  On one hand, you have to be willing to accept that you know a minority of the point-giving factors, and must try to observe or guess at the rest; on the other hand, you have an absolutely cruel two actions per turn, which is insidiously meager.  The garden competition is coming up, and you have to prepare for it in your minimal spare time; however, it&#039;s a worthwhile competition!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This game whizzes by!  Knowing your opponents&#039; suits [creature types] is a fascinating element to this game.  Also, the requirement to follow the pattern that is led sometimes allows the leader to guarantee herself some cards.  The slight downside about that is that others can feel sort of helpless when someone does that.  Of course, due to the very good pace of Gargon, it is barely frustrating when it happens, and more often serves to remind you that you could do that, too....  ;^)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>(Noris edition) This is an auction game with a financial goal, but with the reward for your investment being based on unusual, and overlapping areas on the board.  The placement of these same areas encourages you to tweak what your bid might otherwise be, since to each bid affects which site is auctioned next.  This game has some very interesting interactions between its various mechanisms, and provides strange but fascinating tensions between the players.  Each auction you win provides you with a little equity now, which you can use for credit on subsequent turns, if the need arises.  Each auction you win probably provides you additional equity later, if the feature or features that comprise it are completed; however, the one guarantee in the game is that not every feature will be completed.  Additionally, each time one or more features are completed, everyone&#039;s equity pays them its cold hard cash value, but if several features completed at once, you only get one payout, which prevents total calculation of the game.  Only in the last auction or two can you have a strong confidence for the quality of an investment, and even at that there&#039;s usually still no guarantee that you&#039;re right, due to the endgame triggers.  I think a number of things could be improved with the components of the to increase the players&#039; enjoyment of the game:
1. Some of the garden features are insufficiently clearly delineated.  You can figure them out, but really, I think that is information that should be discernible at a glance.
2. I really would have preferred the player&#039;s possession cubes to be flat, luminescent, translucent markers, so you can more easily see that a space is taken when moving the big auctioneer dude (its thematic name escapes me) and sliding it past the completed spaces.  You could also slightly more easily see to whom a space belongs, and you would also not be obscuring the already difficult-to-discern garden features with opaque markers - albeit tiny ones.
3. It would be nicer for the equity markers (again, thematic name escapes me) to have sizes congruent with their values, or be marked with numerals or pips to show their values.
4. The twitchy, I-move-with-every-bid character is a constant difficulty.  Because as the board fills, the two pawns less often start on the same space, it gets increasingly challenging to figure out the current bid and/or be sure everybody moved that guy when they increased the bid.  I think the simplest solution would be to have a &quot;zero&quot; chip you put under him when a new auction is about to start.  This marks his starting space for that auction, the zero bid.  Then you can fairly easily count spaces from the zero to him.
All that said, I am rather fond of the louis d&#039;or coins and the debt dishes - though I&#039;d have liked the dishes to be better marked as a dept receptacles, because when even halfway through the game, some new players still want to put their stuff by default into their handy dish, something is wrong.  On the upside, this game should be easily playable with homebrew components, which if well chosen could escalate this game to a 7.5 for me.  My prolix list of material complaints are actually fairly minor complaints, although each detracted slightly from the game.</comment>				</item>

There are some nice balances in the game, as long as you approach it in a lateral thinking mindset.  Continent manipulation generally is the road to success and/or upset.  Good stuff.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>This is like [thing=438][/thing], except the chasers are more constrained in their paths; however, the ghost is not allowed to revisit the same place twice.  As a result, the chasers start to be able to deduce where the ghost is — provided their memory holds up.  Fortunately, there are several handicapping mechanisms in the game, as well.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 5.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;ve sort of lost my enjoyment for collaborative games, due primarily to the problem of the experienced or bossy player pretty much playing the game solo, using the other players as extra hands.  Ghost Stories, however, throws so much at you so hard and so fast and on such a small playfield, that it mitigates this problem.  You pretty quickly get trench camaraderie as the four (or fewer) of you sit in a tiny, 3×3 grid, fending off an eternal onslaught of ghosts from all sides.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Great game with gorgeous, if annoying, components.  (Don&#039;t bump the table!)  I can best describe this as an ephemeral rail game.  As far as the things for which Rapa Nui / Easter Island are famed, this features the Moai and the deforestation.  Disease, political unrest, and warring are omitted.  The result:  A very solid game with a fascinating memory component (which you could discard if the players dislike it), which seems at first like it will be no problem, until you&#039;re well into the game.  My second game, I carefully memorized the sites where I&#039;d constructed Moai.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The art is amazing, just as with the base game, and the new building tiles continue the gradual progression of the architecture, which I bloody love.

[b]New Buildings[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] — It&#039;s nice to be able to choose to spend twice as many draws to get a definite 21–23.

[b]Prestige Buildings[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] — It&#039;s just as nice to be able to spend thrice as many draws to draw a face-up, known 24–25.

[b]Green Spaces[/b] [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] — These add a whole new strategic layer to your choices, because your green spaces definitely influence all neighboring districts in which you already have influence, and in some amazing ways.  Plus, if you can wedge your parks next to high-rises, you probably get more points just for that!

[b]Events[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] — These are mighty powerful, and I really enjoy using them — the positive ones, I mean.  I&#039;m not so into the vindictive ones.  Also, it would be nice if unused events were worth at least one token point at the end of the game.

[b]Keep a card[/b] — What is there to say?  It allows you to stow a card for next turn, which is exactly what I always seem to want to do.  This is a variant you can play without owning the expansion, but I think it&#039;s a fine option, even if it mildly violates the spirit of drafting.  ;)

[b]Experts[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] — These are excellent.  Their abilities are rather powerful, but the net effect is like each player choosing a unique character, with a unique ability, to play each game.  It adds intense spice to the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Brilliant.  The auto-manufacture of goods hearkens back to Roads &amp; Boats - an absolute favorite - but the ingenious way in which the production wheels handle it makes even the ingenious wheel in Ora et Labora look clumsy.

Also, we finally have blind simultaneous action selection that doesn&#039;t completely suck.  In fact, it really, really works well.

I can&#039;t wait to play this more and more and experience the overload of buildings.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The concept is superb.  The Gorey-esque art is fun.  It&#039;s just a shame that these weren&#039;t met by an equally good game.  I think a more strategic, and less neighbor-stabbing game using the transparency would be excellent.  You just try to depress your living, and then kill them - or possibly kill your opponents&#039; living before they can get depressed - first, hoping that other players don&#039;t undo your progress, or even cheer up your dead.  Yes, you read that correctly.</comment>				</item>

It doesn&#039;t really add anything revolutionary except cards with play conditions.  ...cards that waste space in your hand, unless you happen to meet the conditions.  Well, the cobalt-colored background for the new family is nice.  ...and some of the deaths have their charms.</comment>				</item>

On the other hand, my 2½-year-olds adore it!  They keep hoping they&#039;ll have a monster to tell to go away (they&#039;re usually pretty concerned for the welfare of the monster in our basement, what with the dinosaur down there and all), but by the end, they are equally pleased that we&#039;ve all completed our rooms, too.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>This is a brilliant abstract game in spices&#039; clothing.  Trying to make progress in 6 categories and nab miscellaneous points over 8 turns with only 3 actions per turn is a blissful challenge.  Fortunately, some of the actions (and auctions) can grant you extra actions, and - needless to say - extra actions can carry you far in this game.  Player interaction is about as low as Princes of Florence, but like Princes of Florence and Puerto Rico, much of the fun is in trying to solve the puzzle of the current game as it unfolds, whilst your opponents do the same, competing for items you need for your grand plan.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>[-]Tentative rating, based on a play that left us we serious doubts that we had all the rules right; however, I&#039;m pretty sure this is a really cool game.[/-]  This [b]is[/b] a really cool game.  It&#039;s a Euro/war game in which the players compete against one another, but only [b]fight[/b] against invaders of their common nation.  Very interesting!  The downside, for me, is that it&#039;s still dice-based combat resolution, but strategic play mitigates the impact of ridiculously bad rolling.  (The winner of our second game kept rolling multiple ones, taking heavy, heavy casualties.  Yes, the winner.)  On coolness alone - and its fascinating ability to make you sincerely root for your opponents even while you try to undermine them - this game would be a 9 for me.  What keeps it down a bit is the complexity and trickiness of explaining the various contingencies.  I think I&#039;m getting better at that, at least.  Well, and there are a few finer points of the rules only found in examples, the nice player summary, or (unfortunately) BGG forums; however, it&#039;s nothing that can&#039;t be resolved temporarily by player consensus.  Really, an excellent game.</comment>	<conditiontext>#137/1500</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Nine strangely-shaped games of Go with 1-4 players in each, driven by an investment game.  This is definitely an unusual mix of gaming, and commendable in that effort - especially released in 1971.  Still, the game drags a bit long for my tastes, though the edition in the violin case gets extra respect for style.</comment>				</item>

Pacing yourself for proper competetiveness at each of the scoring phases is very interesting, especially since you can&#039;t be too sure when opportunities for special scorings will crop up.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The pepper pawns are the best!  This is a card counting game, in which you must second guess your opponents, strike with your strong cards for your crucial ingredients, and hope it&#039;s not an unlucky situation of everyone playing a rare ingredient card, leaving several players wanting.  Decent enough, and it plays quickly with 7, while providing suspense and choices.  Oh, but what awful font choices in the first edition for the various numbers, especially on the menu (summary) cards.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>For its short play time, this game packs plenty of torturous gambling against the other players&#039; secret situations.  There&#039;s just enough variability in the functionality of the cards to allow for the occasional tricky combo, or some subtle strategies to coax a few more points your way.  A pleasant surprise!  Enhancing the experience in the Fantasy Flight edition is the lush artwork.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>So far, the biggest issue I have with this game is the interesting supply-by-dice:  It is possible for the game to stagnate indefinitely, due to the dice not providing multiple passengers on any trains, turn after turn after turn.  :(  I think this could be improved.

A reworked map will be good:  Even if players fight for the northwest, it&#039;s going to be a shutout, and it&#039;s the game-winner for whomever.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The game, on the whole, is very simple… except for building up monuments, which is of course the crux of the game.  The convolution involved in trying to gather enough distinct items for the ritual can be delightfully challenging… and costly and/or profitable.

The choices you must make, and the resource-gathering logistics can heat up your head significantly.  I like it!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 8.03

Don&#039;t expect any thought, but it&#039;s a decent enough reaction and instruction-following, active social game.  I&#039;m sure inebriated adults could have a ridiculous amount of fun with it, too.  ;)

2010-12-04: [b][bgcolor=#99ffff]&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] What makes the game is this:  The faster the servers can jam through the orders, the more points per correct plate they get.  This makes a competitive chef want to read the orders off absolutely as fast as she thinks the servers can handle... which may be [b]too[/b] fast.  This is my kind of cooperative game.  Another great aspect is that a customer will declare a preference like not wanting anything square, and then as the customers swap meals, the servers have to remember to respect those preferences.  Zany.  Fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Long, complex game, whose rules are not so difficult (I learned it starting at my bedtime, and still managed 2nd place out of 5 players), but whose large decisions are wonderfully tough, but comprise numerous smaller, easier decisions.  Thus, the pace of the game is not too bad.  I suspect that someone afflicted with analysis paralysis might make this game misery, but even with 4½ new players (the game-teacher had done most of a solitaire 4p) working very hard to play well, our first game was only three hours, and every second of it was challenging!

I&#039;d like to see a short-play variant posted down the line, for those times when you want the intensity, but don&#039;t have the time; however, I think that like [thing=42052][/thing], once all your players have played it several times, the game length will make a sudden drop of surprising magnitude.  I think it will be a smaller percentage reduction in this one than in Vinhos, but still significant.

Also, I love the way the component design enhances the experience!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>[bgcolor=#cccccc][b]Module 1: New Tiles[/b][/bgcolor]
[b]Specialty tiles[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] These are interesting, in that they don&#039;t provide you with ground floor room upgrades.  I trust that they&#039;re playbalanaced, but I&#039;m not completely convinced of it experientially.  So much of success or failure in Ground Floor hinges on the timing of little decisions that I suspect I merely played sub-optimally for the [b]Inheritance[/b] that had been dealt to me.  I haven&#039;t played [b]Social Media[/b] yet.
[b]Floor Improvement tile[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] The [b]Skyline Achievement[/b] feels like an excellent fit.  It&#039;s easy not to remember which Floor Improvement was the Kickstarter bonus, because it fits so well.
[b]Tenant Improvement tiles[/b] — [b]TBD[/b] The [b]Niche Market[/b] has a really interesting effect, appropriate for the boardgame industry, but I strongly suspect that it is dangerous in all but a very, very strong economic scenario, because people can always undercut your prices; however, I just realized that if your production engine is strong enough, the fact that only one product can be in each space could allow you to monopolize the market, forcing anyone else putting goods up for sale to go straight for liquidation, pretty much guaranteeing slightly better sales for you.  Hmm.  It still sounds like a shoot-the-moon-grade risk, but now I&#039;m more enticed to buy it when the time is right….

[bgcolor=#cccccc][b]Module 2: Economic Scenario Cards and New Economic Forecast Cards[/b][/bgcolor]
[b]Economic Scenario cards[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] I think this is a great idea to inexpensively add inspiration and replay value to the game.  Once you see what they&#039;ve done with these, you realize that you can model any economic period, and pretend you&#039;re playing through it.  Also, with the provided cards, you can play through them chronologically over a series of games, which can make for interesting league play….
[b]Economic Forecast cards[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#00cc00] 10 [/bgcolor][/b] I love the thrill and suspense of [b]Great Depression[/b] and [b]Windfall[/b] being available for the deck.  Their impact is extreme but reasonable, and have interesting effects on the Architect&#039;s Office….

[bgcolor=#cccccc][b]Module 3: Event Deck[/b][/bgcolor] — [b]TBD[/b] This is another inexpensive way to add replay value once you&#039;ve played the game a [b]lot[/b], and it strikes me as a much slower, once-per-game version of [thing=71818][/thing], but for Ground Floor.  Some of these seem more pleasant to play with than others, and for me, these are effects I&#039;d rather explore after becoming very familiar with all the cogs of the game as they are, and with just tweaking the economy and such; thus, I haven&#039;t yet played with them.

[bgcolor=#cccccc][b]Module 4: Architect&#039;s Office[/b][/bgcolor] — [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b]  This can be a frustrating or life-saving option available on the turn, depending on whether it&#039;s helping someone else take what you wanted, or you take what you were at risk of not getting.  The gamble of it is generally low (but is an interesting aspect), because you know what price range you&#039;ll be paying to use it, just not the specific price.  When the economy sucks, it&#039;s cheaper to use than the Construction Company, so of course you go there.  Interesting.</comment>				</item>

Because &quot;your&quot; pieces are simply those that happen to be closest to you, you must play very carefully, lest your opponent force you to make precisely the moves she wanted to happen.  Additionally, nearly every path to your opponent&#039;s &quot;base&quot; provides a path back to yours, so by advancing, you very often make yourself vulnerable.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>piecepack

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>[-]2011-03-28 [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] Tentative rating, after a super-short 2p game.[/-]

2011-04-15: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] This is a nice climbing game, with simpler rules than most, but more satisfying gameplay than most (perhaps as a result).  Suits have no ranking against one another, so nothing to memorize there.  There are no really crazy cards.  There are no cards whose ranks differ from their face value.  All cards that are worth points have the points prominently displayed on them.  Valid plays are sets ([i]n-[/i]-of-a-kind, where [i]n[/i] can be as low as 1), sequences/runs of sets (in which each step of the ladder must have the same suite of suits as all the others), and bombs (which are neatly documented combinations of the cards worth points).
Yet the challenge is kept high by the usual tough climbing game choices, and the fact that sequences must match suit the whole way (and a sequence of singles must be at least 3 steps, while other sequences may be as few as 2).  The betting in the game provides another nice element of suspense.  My favorite thing, however, is that all the scoring is positive:  Anything that would lose you points in most games, in Haggis simply gains your opponents points, instead.  This is functionally identical, except for the enormous fact that you are always moving toward the target score.  The game [b]will[/b] end.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Interesting game, which I think would be much better as a computerized board game.  It seems like the players spend much more of the game mucking with the board, than they do making meaningful decisions.  Still, if it could be automated, I think there&#039;s quite an interesting game in there.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>[b]Cards[/b] — The cards are a fine slipstream into the base game.  Like [thing=86048][/thing], a dash of an additional agenda spices up the game nicely.

[b]The East[/b] — [-]TBD, but it looks like it provides some fascinating alterations to the competition in the game....  I&#039;ve played it a couple of times, but don&#039;t really have anything to say yet….[/-] The new map provides some very nice differences in the dynamics of the game.  It&#039;s just a shame that they wasted the back, even if they did cover it with a picture.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>I am stunned by how enjoyable this is.  Sure, the theme is utterly dispensible, but it makes it a far prettier game than if it had been a simple six-suited, warped poker game.  And - oh! - how warped it is.  I&#039;m trying to find words to describe it, and I can&#039;t yet.  I guess I&#039;ll have to revisit these comments to turn them into something worth reading.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Unusual game, which helps, but it just wasn&#039;t interesting for me.  It doesn&#039;t help that I dislike a core mechanism:  Secretly select your action, and then get punished explicitly for others choosing the same.  ...and there are fewer action options than potential players, just to force that displeasure down my throat.  I have this same complaint about [thing=71272][/thing], whose other mechanisms please me more.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.00

The decisions are sometimes surprisingly agonizing.  Due to its brevity, I find myself returning to this game more than I&#039;d have predicted.  It does get old quickly, however, if I play it several times consecutively.</comment>				</item>

Move your sheep in order to get the shepherd just the right amount of frantic to stand between three sheep and send them back to the barn.  You want to get five of your clever sheep back to the barn first.  The games are usually quick, but thinky!</comment>				</item>

You can also play it casually, but when a 7-year-old figures out on his own — on the first play — to be looking at how he can block my plays, you may find it hard to resist playing strategically and cutthroat.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This game needs a quick, easy summary of play very, very badly.  By the end of the first game, it starts to click.  The instructions are fairly horrific to read, and don&#039;t clearly cover all the likely contingencies.  An example of two rounds of play would do far better than the 28-page rulebook at explaining the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Some cool concepts here.  The downtime is a little much for my tastes.  Due to the broader and random-per-moment selection of cards available, it can be difficult for players to assess what&#039;s available for purchase / defeat, especially since their opponents are valid targets.  There is good use of iconography on the cards, but none in the text of the cards, which means that you can&#039;t at a glance see that you have 7 extra gold to spend on your turn.  You have to hunt for text telling you as much.  I like the way the individual characters can receive equipment and auras; however, I would really prefer for them to be laid out like the items in [thing=18975][/thing], such that each type of item protrudes from a different side of the character.  I think this is a pretty solid product, but just not a great match for my tastes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Fun, quasi-random, chaotic game.  The interaction feels like that of Falling, but without the real-time play.  Plus, the game feels a bit more polished, and better engages the players than Falling.  (Sorry, James!)  The pace can be fairly slow while you learn it, but it&#039;s kind of a delightful, controlled randomness.

Perhaps the best part is that the rules suggest that the winner of the one of a series of games creates (or cancels) a custom rule for the rest of the series.  This can be helpful if, as it happened in our first game, Deception was played four times, one of which was the first turn.  (Deception seems to be a good mode to play once you are familiar with the cards, and can effectively lie about what you&#039;re playing.)  Our first-game winner decreed that Deception was no longer part of the game.  Yes, a game that encourages you to tweak the rules for obnoxiousness, or for taste!  Woo!</comment>				</item>

Matching the block images with the patterns can be hellish — fine — but some of the patterns are backward from what&#039;s on the blocks.  That production mistake is quite damaging to the gameplay that was already not particularly to my tastes.  Too bad, too, because I was stunned by the quality of the components.

I&#039;d love to see expansions like this one provide for use of the other expansions, as well, though.  Having buildings for Mokkabohnen and Ackerbohnen and all the rest would just be splendid!

I was a little surprised by the alterations to what the beans&#039; buildings were, but on the whole, they seem like good changes.

[b]Prohibohn[/b] (expansion to [thing=980]Al Cabohne[/thing]) added a lot of fun, variety, and more interesting goals to its two-player game.</comment>				</item>

2013-06-17:  Don&#039;t play this game on a very, very empty stomach, nine months after your first play.  It&#039;s a little too intricate to recall well, which can diminish enjoyment greatly.  There are a handful of counterintuitive notions that make this more challenging than it really is.  Oh, also, don&#039;t play with five players unless they all five know what they&#039;re doing!  I&#039;m still itching to play this again, because I remember loving it, and now I had a bad experience with it, but know that I loved it.  Must set the record straight!</comment>				</item>

The instructions of the first edition do several things very right, such as bolding nearly everything you need to know in order to play, so you don&#039;t have to read the whole manual if you&#039;re in a hurry.  On the other hand, there are some painful omissions, and the ambiguity they leave in their wake is enough to slow the game down to a crawl.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The first time I played this, I was very disappointed, and felt I&#039;d made a bad purchase.  On subsequent plays, however, it was actually pretty fun.  I think a couple of rules clarifications with regards to backward movement are in order.  With those clarifications, and no expectations of a strategic game, this can be fun.  This is probably a good for a group of highly varied skill and experience, and has a bit of a party game feel, strangely enough.
P.S. Some of the recitation cards are insidiously difficult!</comment>				</item>

There was an unfortunate production choice with the cards:  You can end up with a lot of them, but they are designed such that you must see basically the whole card in order to know what it is.  You can&#039;t just fan them to look at a summary.  Nonetheless, we got by....</comment>	<conditiontext>Like new

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Like [thing=37680][/thing], one of the core mechanisms is secret role selection, with explicit punishment for selecting the same role as someone else, and the issue is nearly forced, depending on the number of players.  The rest of the game, however, is a pretty interesting buzzing about for control, not entirely unlike one of my favorite games, [thing=9440][/thing].  The reconfigurable design of the board and playfield adds good replay value, as well.  Were I to alter the core card mechanism a little, I think I&#039;d actively like this.  I think I may cook up just such a variant....</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 7.00

The frog riding a bicycle on the cover of the game truly does enhance the game for me.  The unjumbling advantage is not enough to guarantee a win, but other players definitely feel disadvantaged playing with such opponents.</comment>				</item>

The brilliance:  Capturing an opponent&#039;s piece puts your attacker out of harm&#039;s way, since it defects to the victim&#039;s side in that very action.  Because of this, you can&#039;t strike, then strike harder from there.  Every attack is a sacrifice.  Every loss is an opportunity for revenge.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>There&#039;s a spine of strategy to it, but it&#039;s mostly tactical.  It most reminds me of Lotus, in that trapping your opponents&#039; pieces is key, and if all your pieces are trapped, you just watch the game go by until you&#039;re liberated, and probably lose at that point.  Unlike Lotus:  Pieces always move one space forward at a time.  A die determines which line must have a piece move, even if it&#039;s an opponent&#039;s piece.  There are pits to detain your pieces until they&#039;re tied for last place.  Your choices are definitely limited, but there are choices to be made... usually.</comment>				</item>

The board is lovely, with a graceful font.  Unfortunately, it&#039;s the Splotter standard of too much stuff having to go into the board&#039;s spaces.  Thankfully, it doesn&#039;t wreck the game by any means - just makes it a little tougher to play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s kind of interesting, but it doesn&#039;t really strike my tastes well, what with constantly needling one another, and the the highly tactical, go-with-the-flow nature of it all.  I do like the strategies one can employ with the power plants and some of the building combinations, but on the whole, you just have to use the tiles you get.  If you get nothing aggressive, and your opponents do, they can cut you to ribbons while you just try to string stuff along.

It&#039;s a shame that they didn&#039;t provide rules summary cards, because the rules are simple enough to fit on a 2-sided card, rather than leafing through the 7 pages of rules to answer the question, &quot;What&#039;s next?&quot;

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I love the mechanisms of this game, but the inability to do much during the downtime makes the game take about an hour per player. The single most time-consuming action is movement, and guess which action is completely susceptible to everyone else&#039;s, and thus must really be planned and executed on your turn, &#039;cause it&#039;s going to get messed up anyway.

As a solitaire game, with a simple rule to clutter the path with opponents to jump over, I think this game would be an [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b].

4p: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] (or worse) due to the extreme length of the game sucking the joy out of it.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.00

Much later, [thing=25951][/thing] would use a similar blind partnership deduction notion, and both suffer from a particular problem, for my tastes at least:  Although you can help your teammate once you know who it is, you can only help when you have the opportunity to do so, and it&#039;s very possible that one player carries the whole team.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This game is innovative, and features singular gameplay; however, there&#039;s a heck of a lot of conflict and beatdown, and a heavy dose of other players undoing slow, painstaking work in an instant.  So, while I greatly respect this game&#039;s freshness and its allowance for lateral thinking, the experience is not much to my tastes.  Plenty of people are lapping it up, though, which is great.  I&#039;d hate to see such fresh ideas going to waste out of the spotlight.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>NULL</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This has pretty nice art, and the theme is really going to appeal to some; however, despite the nice uncertainty of whether yielding, and subsequently confessing, might be the better choice for scoring purposes, I just didn&#039;t enjoy it much at all.  Definitely narrate the play and get into the theme if you play it.  It boosts enjoyment dramatically.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>Lots of different ways to approach this; I think Rüdiger Dorn has created another very fun game.  The familiar stacks of mancala-inspired strewing — pretty much trademark Dorn — are not used at all in his usual way; however, as the game progresses, you figure out that they sort of are, but with a little evolution that really is interesting.  I think this game has a lot of replay value, with plenty to explore, especially because the customizable board really discourages strategy ruts, I&#039;d imagine.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 7.50

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>If you&#039;re curious about this, don&#039;t let a reading of the rules put you off.  What may seem overly simplistic and restrictive in the rules actually holds some tense tactical maneuvering and timing choices.  The options the worms give you (reroll or pass!) elevate the game.  As in [thing=13642][/thing] and something more recent that&#039;s slipping my mind, procrastination is much more powerful and interesting than it seems at first.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 6.30

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Don&#039;t be a wimp.  Play all 5 expansions (unless you discover that one or more really don&#039;t appeal to you).  The [thing=60127]Investor &amp; Business cards[/thing] work as they did as a mini-expansion, but now have a more professional look, the Business cards bearing meaningful icons, and each type having its own appropriate, custom back to better distinguish it from the various flight cards.

[b]Business Cards[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] You start with two of these, and receive another each time you complete a long (5- or 7-point) route... assuming you ever remember to.  Each of these cards is worth at least €5 to you, because you can cash them in at any time for €5.  Alternatively, each one can be used to create a connection swap with an opponent, injecting a bit of negotiation into the game, should you desire, saving you each at least €10.  Finally, each card&#039;s primary function is its text, which can give you cash, a deal, or some short- or long-term game advantage.  The great thing with this expansion is that it&#039;s up to you, with each card.  If you don&#039;t want to bother with the details, just treat them as €5 gift cards you can spend, and let your opponents futz with all that.
The main point is that these infuse much-needed money into the game, and add appropriate reward for the long routes.  You can still pull off a short-route win, but it&#039;s much more opportunistic, and won&#039;t work every time.

[b]Investor Cards[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] If you&#039;ve ever played [thing=47][/thing], you already know how these work; however, in this case, there are two, rather than six, and they trigger with the vacations, rather than periodically.  The Investor cards simply throw money into the game in some surprising way, come vacation time.  Maybe each player gets €25, maybe the player in last place gets the most money, perhaps the players receive rewards for having the most of each type of flight.  You don&#039;t know, so atop the suspense of not knowing exactly when the first vacation card will appear, you don&#039;t know what bonus each will bring with it.

[b]Flight Cards[/b] — [-][b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5.5 [/bgcolor][/b] These basically double the Short, Long, and Final Flight decks, or allow you to weight them as you please, if you don&#039;t like the default balance of the cards.  I would never buy these as a stand-alone expansion, and now that they&#039;re mixed in, I won&#039;t take them out, even though they are politely marked with a &quot;DL&quot; so you can.  It sounds like these are supposed to even out the distribution in the respective decks, but I certainly didn&#039;t notice any effect on gameplay.  I grant that these might be very meaningful to me had I played the game every day since its release.  :shrug:[/-]
[b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] These flesh out the rest of the possible routes, and massively increase the deck size, which handicaps the players who know the deck, should you choose.  I believe these help pull the experienced player a little closer to the level of the newbie....

[b]Hubs[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] Again, without adding much complexity to the game, the players are yet again empowered to grant themselves more cash.  By placing your hub well, you can get extra cash during the game, which can be crucial — especially at the beginning.  Every time someone claims a link that involves your hub in any way, you get €2 from the bank.  More money into the game, which will be utterly crucial for Distant Lands.  If [b]you[/b] claim a link that involves your hub, you may instead choose to establish your other hub, take a permanent €2 income boost (!), or 1 point (!).

[b]Distant Lands[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] Here&#039;s what you feel you paid for.  Here&#039;s what they knew you&#039;d feel you paid for, so they used its name for the entire boxed product.  The first time you see these on the table, you may soil yourself from sticker shock.  Links within Europe are €5 (or a little more), and €5 planes are quite adequate.  In order to reach the titular distant lands, the airspace rights cost €20 or €22 (!!), and the big airliners cost €25 (!!!).  Your reward is 8 points and... [drum roll] [b]a permanent income boost of €5![/b]  Suddenly, the €45 price starts to seem very useful when compared to the benefits of a €10 investment.  This is a cool, high-level goal, which adds another level of competition.

All in all, this expansion is totally worth it.  I&#039;d never have guessed that they could add so much to such a good game, adding so little complexity.  Regardless, I still can&#039;t imagine what could possibly go into an Expansion Set 2, but after this, I&#039;m looking forward to it (eventually, eventually).</comment>				</item>

Its &quot;backward&quot; nature may make a newbie&#039;s first game a complete waste, since you are specifically trying to lose all your pieces (except the impervious jobber); however, it is quite interesting to play once you convince yourself that your piece getting captured before it gets to its elimination space is actually generally a good thing!</comment>	<conditiontext>print-and-play</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>A classic word deduction game.  Unfortunately for the publishers, you really don&#039;t need special apparatus to play this.  Although my parents own it - and now I do, too, for old time&#039;s sake, and show of appreciation - for many years, we have just played on paper placemats in restaurants.  Its descendant, [thing=12137]My Word![/thing], adds some ingenuity, and has a little more need for pre-printed sheets, and is more cool and vicious.

Anyway, this is a rating for Jotto.  It&#039;s basically a more interesting derivative of Mastermind.</comment>	<conditiontext>1972 edition, still in the original shrinkwrap!!</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Although by its very nature, the game features much opportunistic play, the variety of cards you have keeps each player participating at a good frequency.  In the first stage, this is due to having three different characters you could move; in the second, due to being able to use any to move the raft.  The third is all about a little rough, random treasure loss, but it&#039;s quite fast, and thus a nice, thematic way to end the game suspensefully.  In both of the stages with movement by volition, the players have plenty of opportunity for lateral thinking.  A nice game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>This is a good, suspenseful, risk management game, with a feel unlike much of anything else.  If you&#039;re at least decent at card-counting, you will merely have to bank on the odds of getting the cards you need when you need them; however, timing that against the weather and your opponents&#039; decisions are what really make the game.  Fun, and it sits in that magical lens of the Venn diagram where family gaming and gamer gaming truly overlap!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Very interesting struggle for two players.  Guessing which cards to keep for offensive or defensive purposes keeps the suspense fairly high as you try to break your opponent&#039;s control over here, while she tries to break yours over there in such a way that it cascades and destroys your foothold where you were hoping to get control.  Good stuff.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>As usual for Gigamic, the components are awesome.

This [b]sounds[/b] like a good idea; however, the rules proudly employ a big [thing=2952][/thing] design flaw, which is that guessing correctly gives you another turn, and another, and another.  At the beginning of the game, this is fine, because it&#039;s a crap shoot, but later, you have enough information to just keep going, while the other players stare at the board, bored.  To mitigate this problem, they employed the best mechanism in the world:  [i]lose a turn[/i]!  Yay!  :yuk:  Every time you draw a zero, your turn ends — even if it was the first thing you drew on your turn.

I think this game could be a [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b] or better if you eliminated those two rules.  I suggest changing it as follows:
:colonist: You get a fixed, finite number of guesses on your turn (e.g. either 1, 2, 3, but pick one for everybody for the whole game), regardless of whether you&#039;re right.  The points for right guesses are enough reward.
:colonist: If you draw a zero, you get to claim a number of stones from the board equal to your rank so far in the game (e.g. 1st gets 1; 2nd, 2; 3rd, 3; 4th, 4 — if you&#039;re tied for 2nd, it&#039;s still 2, etc.).  You get free points, but the players after you have more information....</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>41</numplays>			<comment>This game is BRILLIANT!  The basic game may well be solvable, but standard and beyond are sufficiently varied to keep us humans busy for a while.

I adore that you can play a basic game, then decide when it&#039;s done that you want to turn it into the first round of a standard game, and so on.  The production is ridiculously good, and surprisingly large.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is an intense constraint game, since my move constrains your next play to [b]your choice[/b] of matching &quot;suit&quot; or matching &quot;number&quot; space.  Additionally, being a connection game on a small field means that you must be careful in your choices.  Of course, you can also win by surrounding spaces, regardless of whether they&#039;re occupied, so again you must be very careful in the choices you force upon your opponent.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>NULL</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>2014-03-30: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] First impression of 2014 edition (before rulebook refinement).  There are some awesome mechanisms in this game, and it plays a lot faster than its visual intricacy suggests.  I can&#039;t wait to get more intimate with it.  I last knew it 4 years ago, and it was great even then, but (needless to say) it has matured significantly in those 4 years.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>The nice catch with all these games is that getting discs outside the border — sending them out of the ring [i]per se[/i] — is always bad.  Let me put it this way:  Imagine playing billiards with þe olde &quot;off the table is a scratch&quot; rule, except the table has no walls....

[b]Karambolage[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff]&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] Roll two color dice, which will indicate which disc must strike another.  Use the [i]firing band[/i] to propel the one into the other, optionally banking them off a block.  This is a pleasant challenge, especially since better players can handicap themselves by always having to bank their shot.

[b]Karamba[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff]&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] Roll two color dice, which indicate the two discs that mark the ends of an imaginary goal, through which you must propel another disc.  In ways, it&#039;s easier than Karambolage, because the target can be so big; in others, it&#039;s tougher, because the angle relative to the target can be problematic.  Another good game.

[b]Karamboli[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff]&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] This one is serial multi-player, by which I mean that you play your whole round, note the score, then set up for the next person.  As in bowling, there is no player interaction, so you merely compare performances and try to beat your best.  Launch the first disc into a rectangular &quot;ring&quot;, and then with each subsequent disc, try to strike as many of the previously-launched discs as possible.  This is pretty fun, too, but it&#039;s a little less enticing to play, unless you have a consistent way of setting up the playfield.  Imagine bowling before the days of mechanized pinsetters and regulation lanes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This game can put you through some agonizing decisions as to how the heck you are going to get the cards you want without throwing away the cards that make you want the auctioned cards in order to get them.  That aspect of this game forges its kinship with [thing=125]Money![/thing] (also by Knizia).  The harsh, intentional brevity of this game practically requires that you play it several times consecutively, in order to get your mind into the right pacing to do well.  I really like the bidding rules:  You may bid X secret unique cards or X declared identical cards, but X identical always beats X unique.</comment>				</item>

The influx of keyples slows to a trickle by the winter, the fourth and final season, so luring other players&#039; keyples to your town is crucial to keeping your supply of actions high for next season!  Wads of replay value in this, due to some reversible tiles, and not using all tiles (except in a 6p game — yes, 6p).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>2008-10-29: This really adds a lot to the element of surprise, bridging the gap between Khet and Laser Battle, and trumping both, as well.  Great!

2011-04-06: I&#039;m a bit dismayed by the slightly shoddy alignment of the mirrors.  I can&#039;t do something as simple (and sneaky) as routing the laser up to the tower, around, then back down the tower, due to the misalignment.  :soblue:</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>2007-06-16:  The Eye of Horus adds a lot of vitality to Khet.  Since you sometimes find yourself tracking three &quot;branches&quot; of laser beam with it in play, it provides plenty of extra sneakiness to the game.  It also grants the possibly of hitting three units in one turn - be they friend or foe, of course.  If you have this and the base game, you won&#039;t play without it unless one of the players isn&#039;t up to the challenge yet (e.g. newbie).  It just makes Khet a better game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>2007-06-16:  I am amazed by how different this is from Laser Battle.  Movement is very slow, deliberate, and calculated in Khet, since you either rotate a piece 90° or move it 1 space, and then MUST fire your laser - very possibly killing your own unit or pharaoh.  This gives it an intense feel, like chess crossed with 8-ball:  &quot;DOH!  I was so fixated on this move over here that I didn&#039;t notice I was giving you a clean shot on my pharaoh!&quot; or &quot;DOH!  I lost the game by shooting my own pharaoh!&quot;  All in all, I like it, and feel that it provides a very different experience from Laser Battle.  The various starting configurations increase the replay value over traditional chesses (except Sittuyin, in which setup is part of the game), especially since they encourage experienced players to invent their own starting setups.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is pretty much exactly what I don&#039;t like in a game:  Frivolous gameplay, with high-interaction card text whose meaning is too often not perspicuous.  The rules do a fair job of explaining what it&#039;s all about, but I feel that better iconography on the cards to accompany (not replace!) the text would help.  For example, the gauntlets that point in the direction of the affected player are a good idea, except that they&#039;re pointy all over, and end up looking more like clouds or something, somehow… and they inexplicably have vines winding around them, really negating the effect of portraying a gauntlet pointing directly at a player.

I think, however, that people who like high-interaction games, with utterly optional negotiation and bluffing, and extremely reactive gameplay, mostly at the mercy of the scant cards in your hand that you are required to play will love this.  It doesn&#039;t seem like a badly designed game — just a game badly designed for my tastes.

I do rather like the illustrations on the role (and Execution Order) cards, though!  …and I absolutely appreciate allowing the players to choose the male or female side of those cards, as they wish.</comment>				</item>

This one embraces using the chess pieces as playing cards and vice versa, instead of merely making the chess pieces drawable from a deck. You have the four traditional poker suits, but each suit has 16 cards, each of which corresponds to a unit of one player&#039;s chess pieces. 1–8 are the pawns, 9–10 are the bishops, and the rooks, knights, king, and queen are face cards.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Very tentative rating after a high-distraction, partially-botched first game.
Wow, we really misunderstood the scoring in the first game until the second scoring occurred.  The rules have a few miscues about the scoring, and less than perfect scrutiny when reading them can jack you right up.  For example:  The section entitled &quot;Scoring a Room&quot; would be better named &quot;Scoring the Furniture in a Full Room&quot;.  The rooms serve only to specify the threshold for scoring, and to lend a relatively small bonus to some of the furniture.  What I&#039;m saying is that a moons room scoring does not mean the moons guild gets any points:  They only get points for having moons furniture in a room that scores.
One fairly unlikely, but quite real concern not addressed in the rules is what to do if two players distribute their investments identically, which will always end in a tie.  For that matter, ties are not addressed for the other unlikely cases in which the players&#039; sums just happen to match.  The former, however, I think would lead to quite the feeling of futility for a playing - especially for a 2p game.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>piecepack</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting progress-your-dice-pool game that hearkens back to [thing=21632][/thing], but with different colors of dice to be used as building materials.  The net effect is pretty fun, and the extra cards included enhance the replay value; however, it does suffer from the classic dice game flaw:  Rolling higher is always better, with little to mitigate that.  The game does [potentially] give you a convert-ones-to-sixes ability, but that just means that you&#039;ll roll all twos, and once you know the game, your chronically bad rollers know to hoard dice of any type so they can be destroyed to create the ones they need; however, sooner or later, you still have to roll well, and — more importantly — better than your opponents.  Even with a handful of die tweaking abilities at your fingertips, this may just not happen for you.

I like it, I&#039;d play it, and if you love dice games, I think you&#039;ll dig this.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is a pretty cool game with way way WAY too much downtime and length for what it provides the player.  I think I would rate this an [b][bgcolor=#66ff99]&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] if it were a computer game you played against AIs.  One other bother about the game is that high rolls are strictly better.  This is a bothersome trait for dice games, because your odds of rolling high are equal to your odds of rolling low.  Let&#039;s just flip a coin, and declare that heads is always the better flip while we&#039;re at it.  To Court the King (Um Krone und Kragen) mitigates this much better, in that straights and n-of-a-kind are the primary beneficial patterns, and by the time you really need to deal with high rolls being strictly better, you have had plenty of opportunities to get abilities that can increase your die rolls.  On the other hand, Kingsburg provides a little bit of a plot, as you progress and build, hoping to fend off increasingly difficult foes, whose strength is only vaguely known, unless you sacrifice opportunities to see what the creatures are.

Seriously, I would love to play this against only AIs.</comment>				</item>

It provides dexterity placement choices like [thing=17166][/thing], but without being collectible, and with a simple enough ruleset that you can actually play it casually (i.e. without needing to be obsessed with it, in order to be able to have all the intricate rules and interactions and rulings memorized), and without squinting at the pieces.  Very nice, and playable on any reasonably low-friction, horizontal surface — not that I&#039;m suggesting that it wouldn&#039;t be fun to play in microgravity (see [thing=162][/thing]).

I have a hard time seeing how you can win besides capitalizing on a mistake by your opponent, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s my own shortcoming and inexperience.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I math traded for this, because I love playing with cogs, and I figured it would at least be an educational toy for five-year-olds; however, I had hopes that it would at least be decent — maybe a [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b].  Then we started playing, and I quickly saw that it was probably a foregone conclusion, and very simplistic.  ...but as the game progressed, I started to see the sneaky stuff you could do, in abstract strategy terms.  With two familiar and competent players, this probably distills to a game of &quot;Who will make the first mistake?&quot;, but for now, I dig it!

As with [thing=16991]Khet[/thing], you are required to check your work at the end of your turn, with the possible outcomes being win, lose, or keep playing.  I love having an excuse to spin the cogs each turn.  :meeple:</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 5.00

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The bits are great, and bear just little enough grip to provide great challenge in stacking the letters.  The rules as published are barely functional.  They veritably require you to start every pile on a vowel, because the chances of randomly rolling a vowel after that aren&#039;t great — not horrible, but not great.  Since the only way to score is to make words, and every fall subtracts three points from the culprit&#039;s score, this could be a never-ending game.  Fortunately, with such great letter pieces, there&#039;s sufficient impetus to &quot;fix&quot; this game, and there are numerous ways to do so.  You could adapt the [thing=39635][/thing] / [thing=40990][/thing] notion that you can use any word you wish:  Just require them to include the letter they played, and they score a point for each connected letter in the word.  You could borrow from Wheel of Fortune, by allowing players to buy a vowel with points.  The negative points for causing a fall seem a little brutal, when the as-published rules reward you for [b]nothing[/b] except forming complete (albeit possibly jumbled) words.  So, you may want to award a point for each turn in which you successfully plug in a letter.

I think there are great games waiting to be chiseled from these partially chiseled letters, but the onus is on the customers to sculpt those great games themselves.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>So far, played with merely three, then five.  With more players, it was more dynamic and suspenseful, but the other team by game end had all six of the winning items, as well as the both bags which were counting as key and goblet by then, since all the items had been drawn.  So, I enjoyed it more than the first game, but gained a concern about how much players could simply be victimized.  I also am concerned that the smaller team lost in both odd-playered games.  Not much of a sample set to call it a trend, but I&#039;m a little leery.

Still, it&#039;s an interesting take on deduction and collection, and doubtlessly, the art is incredibly beautiful.  I look forward to playing this more, and seeing what I think in the long run!  Some other players were asking where to buy it, so clearly it is not a fail.

I&#039;m optimistic that it will rise to at least a 7 with further play, but if the concerns are confirmed, it could drop due to the knowledge that the gaming experience could be littered with unpleasantly helpless situations.  My guess is that with experience, the minority team will get even or perhaps an advantage, since 1/3 of their goal objects are face-up on the table for each player.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This has some interesting things going on in it, but the 1919–1929 scenario didn&#039;t convince me of the game&#039;s greatness.  I&#039;d be willing to try other scenarios, but the first edition&#039;s rulebooks are… not good.

The original French is riddled with mistakes, some of which were corrected in the English rulebook (I haven&#039;t gotten to see the German yet); however, the English translation — well, there are a lot of things I would have translated differently.  An example of a term I would have translated differently:  The French rules use the word &quot;meeting&quot; (yes, the English word) to refer to an event that I would have called an &quot;air show&quot;.  Needless to say, whoever or whatever translated the French to English used the word &quot;meeting&quot; that was there already.

I think there&#039;s an interesting game buried in these dodgy rules, but even so, it may not be a game for me.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Of the [thing=11]Bohnanza[/thing] expansions, this one definitely has my favorite art.  I love that you can set the males beside the females, and they are so well paired that they look like they were split from an original image with both of them in it.
As for the gameplay, the ladies are an interesting addition, stirring things up a bit, yet not disrupting gameplay significantly.  This expansion doesn&#039;t really require you to alter your mental ruleset much, since you simply look at the top card when you harvest, and follow its bean-o-meter.  Yet, you will find yourself maneuvering to time the ladies just right so you can maximize your harvest....</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s the sort of children&#039;s game with no decisions - not even superfluous ones.  No skill, nothing.  It can help kids learn to count and take turns, but that&#039;s about it.

On the other hand, special attention was given to the movement cards to make it easy for pre-counters to count correctly.

Still, for a no-decision game, the &quot;thrills&quot; are provided by some cards that let you take a subsequent turn, others that send you backward (some of which still let you take another turn, but since you may go yet further backward), and spaces that send you back or forward as well.  The graphics and tokens are nice, but my kids even got bored before they could even find out why we were collecting aphids (having not really understood it from the included story).  On a second play on another day, run in fast-forward, one of the kids barely maintained interest until the end, and the other left at what ended up being the 80% mark.  ...but you can&#039;t know.

This game sports several of my least-favorite mechanisms:  No choices whatsoever, draw-and-move, complete with cards that have you go again, cards that send you backward, spaces on the board that send you back (slowing the game), veritable tollbooth spaces, which if you pass them and are then sent back, require you to PAY AGAIN.  With neither control over your movement nor what you collect, this punishes all the players by making the mindlessness drag on.

The only reason I can be convinced to play this is if my three-year-olds insist on it, but you&#039;d better believe I&#039;ll be suggesting any number of other games, such as another ladybug game, Maskenball der Käfer, which exercises the mind and actually provides surprise and entertainment.

The Ladybug Game is a mindless pastime intended to occupy your children while reinforcing their ability to count from one to six, occasionally to ten.

One last note:  For a game designed by a six-year-old, this is excellent.  I&#039;ve played worse games designed by professional and/or renowned designers.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Fast-paced tactical puzzle game.  Having only thirty seconds to make your moves, in addition to all the coral reefs that end your turn if you can&#039;t avoid them makes this game fast-paced.  The ability to carry about your opponents&#039; marbles, as well as the capability to swap marbles with them can turn the game into a bit of a chase with fewer than four players.  
Additionally, blocking your opponent&#039;s path with your own raft can be an insidious tactic.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>2¼ years old:  They ate this up.  They did very well taking turns and guessing each other&#039;s shape choice and counting their sheep up the ladder.  The only troubles were that the sheep are wont to fall off the ladder (the physical design can only be so clever), and my son tended to loudly announce his secret choice to my daughter.
As for me:  Quick, painless game to play with your kids.  You&#039;re guessing, so that&#039;s pretty even footing, too.
3½ years old:  They can exercise extreme restraint not to look at each other&#039;s selections... sometimes.  They still enjoy it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Good fun, this!  The brief instructions on the cards omit a few details that leave you needing to agree on what plays are legal, but it doesn&#039;t prevent the game from being fun.

[thread=460367]Clarifications[/thread]:
:colonist: You may play as many cards on your turn as you wish, willy-nilly, all over the place.
:colonist: Compound words may only be formed in traditional crossword directions (i.e. not word-search).
:colonist: Any cards that are adjacent must form valid compound words.
:colonist: Your turn does not end if a word is successfully denied as being valid.
:colonist: Hyphenated words and constructs are not inherently illegal:  It&#039;s up to the players whether they&#039;ll let it stand.

I like it!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>This is an interesting, competitive, semi-random arrangement game.  It feels very abstract, despite it making sense, for the most part, thematically.

My main gripe with the game is that the multi-colored butterfly doesn&#039;t follow the same algorithm as the others, which causes seemingly unnecessary confusion for such a simple game.

The bits are very fun, and definitely enhance the experience.

Examples to clarify the rules (note: diagonals don&#039;t count):
:colonist: If you plant a red flower, and the contiguous group of red flowers is at least as large as anyone else&#039;s, the red butterfly comes over to it. …and if the red group is larger than anyone else&#039;s group of flowers of [b]any[/b] one color, so does the bumblebee.
:colonist: If you plant a red flower, and the contiguous group of red and orange flowers is at least as large as anyone else&#039;s the red and orange butterfly comes over to it.
:colonist: If the flower you planted makes its contiguous group of flowers have more colors than anyone else&#039;s, the five-color butterfly comes over to it.

Also, I think the bumblebee variant is a good addition to the game.  Having the lesser negative points looming as a small threat adds an interesting motivation to the decision-making process.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>For a while (until getting it out to play it, finally), I forgot that Forbidden Machines doesn&#039;t just swap imaginary technologies in to replace the real technologies, so I just wasn&#039;t feeling much motivation to get it out.  Once I did, I was reminded that there are now &quot;When established&quot; triggers on some of the new techs, and technology activations you can do on some of them.  This greatly enhances the already-tough decisions.  For a slightly lighter game, play the base game&#039;s cards; for a slightly heavier game, play these.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 8.50

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Like [thing=121086]the 5-card expansion[/thing] for [thing=119781]the base game[/thing], these are welcome additions.  My favorites are the tricky Counterbalance, which starts with 0 influence on it, is fundamental, but feeds nothing, and is worth 7 points, but requires you to discard 2 cards after playing it… if you have them :ninja:; and the Resonator.  There are only 2 Resonators in the deck, and it depends on itself; so, they must both be in play in order for one to be successful.  Mind-bending, but cool.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 8.00

The screwage by a person with gobs of influence going after you can be killer, so you kind of have to wait them out, which isn&#039;t a fun aspect of the game, but everything else is mighty nice.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.30

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>There is a lot of goodness in this game.  The theme is exciting, and is carried well in the invention cards.  Building the inventions is a little like a kinder version of Freya&#039;s Folly, in that when someone beats you to the punch, you can still finish your work for fewer points.  Upgrading your workshop(s) and adding mechanical men to automate what your apprentices could be doing is a worthwhile thing to do, if well timed.  Acquiring goodies is done through an interesting bidding system which basically requires you to commit all the apprentices of your &quot;bid&quot; at once, except for your master (or vice versa)... unless you get the council action that lets you move an apprentice.  If you don&#039;t win the bid, you can still get the goodies for an increasing amount of money.  In fact, you can keep buying more of the things, if you can afford it, and the fee does stop rising after the fourth purchase during a round.

What absolutely wrecks this game is the core mechanism.  Your apprentices are permanent resources that you commit anew each round.  One of the things you can do with them is use them directly to bid for more apprentices.  If you get shut out on this, and can&#039;t afford to buy them, you waste your resouces.  The people with more apprentices just keep getting more, while the people still with the minimum can&#039;t get any.  The leaders don&#039;t have to spend some consumable resource to get more of them, so it&#039;s a built-in runaway crush-o-matic mechanism.  Additionally, the people with more apprentices can procrastinate committing the bulk of them to what they want until after the weak players have committed all theirs.  The only &quot;hope&quot; for a player out of money, with the minimum number of apprentices, is to miraculously complete works to get cash, which they can use to buy the apprentice when they&#039;re outbid.  See the nice layers of abstraction there?  Why the horrible direct acquisition of workers by having the most workers?  HORRIBLE.

There is so much good game here.  I hate that it is ruined so deftly by its central mechanism.

I guess there are other horrid things, too.  The instructions are dodgy, and the game setup involves ten minutes of bizarre deck manipulation that is different for each quantity of players.  I was ready to forgive those aspects, though, for the elegance of the game, until the crush-o-tron showed itself.  Such a shame.

I&#039;d like to see if playing without C, the apprentice part of the city, and instead giving each player one more apprentice at the end of each round salvages the game.  That would mean that you would start round 2 with 4 of your apprentices, and get your 9th one just in time for the round 8-9 dénouement of sorts.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Having played only a solitaire 2p game and [thread=460807]my solitaire variant[/thread], I had this to say:  You get the tension of a more organic [thing=1293][/thing], because your eyes get to roam vast letters, and small eddies of letters, looking for words any which way; however, you get to lay your tiles as you like, providing a little bit of strategy.  [thing=39241][/thing] is not just a word-search game, although that is a sufficiently significant component of it that you will benefit if you excel at such things.  Will it win you the game?  Not necessarily, but it will help a lot.
Once I finally played with other humanoids, I found the game to be a very interesting challenge.  In short, you flip the timer, then place a letter tile that will form at least one new word, and finally noting any yet-unfound words you see.  Once you&#039;re done, the other players have one chance to knock, indicating that you missed some.  Anyone who knocked then gets a crack, in knock order, at identifying any yet-unfound words.  This leads to some interesting strategic choices, because you can make plays that give far fewer words, but allow you to horde them all for yourself in your limited time.  Very cool word game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[b]First edition note:[/b] The intense epoxy fumes from the box are torturous, especially if you have a sensitive nose. Air that sucker out, and hope for the best.

Now, as for the game itself, I really like it. It is right up my alley. The only flaw is that the &quot;hold &#039;em&quot; 3 face-up cards in the middle lead to a lot of downtime. You can&#039;t be sure what 30% of your &quot;hand&quot; will be until your turn comes around. Try the following downtime-killing variants to see which works for you:

[b]10-Card Stud[/b] Each player just gets 10 cards in their hand, instead of 7. There are no shared cards in the center.

[b]Card Conveyor[/b] The middle of the table has 2 more cards than the number of players (2p: 4; 5p: 7), but only the left 3 are available for the current player. Using them does [b]not[/b] discard them. Instead, after each player&#039;s turn, the leftmost card gets discarded, the others shift left, and a new card comes out to fill the gap on the right. This way, each player can always start plan her next turn as soon as she finishes her current one.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I like this quite a bit better than what clearly must be its inspiration, [thing=45][/thing]: It&#039;s quiet, you have control over your die values, and a clue about the sample set available; however, its victory conditions are even more degenerative than its predecessor. The tension is good, but I&#039;m never going to want to grind each other player out, one card at a time, especially because it&#039;s too easy to be pegged as you have fewer cards and fewer players. A step in the right direction, and easy enough to tweak to my tastes!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 5.00

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m not much for n-in-a-row games, but this infuses enough cleverness (especially having two ways to win) into the notion as to make it very interesting to play.  The fact that it comes with discs to alter the boards&#039; colors for theoretically infinite replay value is a serious selling point (and I haven&#039;t even factored that into my rating!). So, if this concept interests you, rest assured that you get a lot more bang for your buck with the configurable board….</comment>				</item>

The first time you play, it can be really tricky to tell where you can play a &quot;broken&quot; word for triple score.  It&#039;s actually rather difficult to find such an opportunity, and is well justified in being triple the word score for pulling it off.  I&#039;d love to see this remanufactured with a LEGO level of precision.</comment>				</item>

If you play this, insist on playing with all the variant rules, because all they do is add a little strategy, with negligible additional complexity.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>2013-06-01 [b][bgcolor=#80FFCC] 7.5 [/bgcolor][/b] This is actually a very interesting game.  Essentially pick up and deliver back, and forth, and back, and forth… between two cities and among the towns therebetween.  Also, choose which of two roads to take on either side of the Loire, depending on your needs.  Fund your endeavors by buying materials low and selling them high.  Hire people and build buildings to facilitate your tasks.  Other than some slightly strange production choices for this otherwise lovely game, laden with helpful visual cues, the biggest downside is that there are so many buildings and characters from which you can choose that perusing them can inject a lot of downtime in a game that wants to be fast-paced.  Fortunately, for the most part, you can finish your turn, informing folks of your shopping intentions, then go shopping while people play on.  Also, this weakness is one of the game&#039;s strengths:  The variety of advantageous cards for purchase provides plenty of replay value, and dynamic strategies, so you don&#039;t just have everyone duking it out for one thing.  I&#039;d like to play this more, and get comfortable with it.

As always, [person=2762][/person] provides some interesting innovations, and unique gameplay elements and singular feel to his game.

2015-08-03 1p: [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] All of the running around and most of the fun. Occasionally, you may lose track of which piece you moved first in your turn, and thus be unsure whether you should have incremented the turn counter, but all in all, it&#039;s La Loire!</comment>	<conditiontext>Limited edition n. 659</conditiontext>			<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 6.40

The main problem is that I can never remember to put the bloody things on the table after each day. :shake:

[b]Future[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] These are good. I&#039;ve never played without them, and they fit so seamlessly that it&#039;s easy to forget they&#039;re add-ons.

[b]Office[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] These are so very different from Trash that it&#039;s hard to choose which to use each game. So, I make the other players choose. ;)</comment>				</item>

If you draw nothing but merchant ships, but play them every turn, you should get a number of them through.  If you draw a lot of pirates, then sack others&#039; ships.  Interesting, quick game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Throw away the white, non-glossy rules that come in the box.  Do it.  Now, only use the latest, greatest rules.  Ah, there you go.  This game is fun in semi-cooperative mode.  Instead of the players bashing each other, they score glory in a similar way while competing together against Sauron.  Once you get the game down, this can turn into calculated choices to let Sauron&#039;s forces remain just strong enough to wipe out high-scoring units your opponents have in play.  The corruption of things in the Wilds really works well.  If too many become corrupted, all players lose; but worse, anything that becomes corrupted (and isn&#039;t already [i]mustered[/i] or [i]prepared[/i]) is rendered blank.  So, you weren&#039;t sweating Sam getting corrupted… until you pulled four Sam dice from your bag — four effectively blank Sam dice.  If you&#039;re used to cooperative games kick your butt around the block, you will be surprised by how easy it is to beat Sauron with even just a modicum of cooperation; however, I think it is clear that the intention is simply for the players compete against one another in a more structured setting than just a free-for-all.

Note: The game also has fully-cooperative rules which sound like they make it more difficult to defeat Sauron, but I haven&#039;t tried them.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Other than the crappy, half-baked printed rulebook, which has been updated in electronic form, the spielbox review made this sound pretty interesting, in its progressive nature.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>WOW this was fun.  True, a lot of it probably had to do with our Sauron saying, in a deep voice, &quot;Poooo....&quot; whenever he was foiled.  Sauron as a person has many cruel choices to make, but also can make mistakes.  In a strange and frightening way, this sort of balances.  Good, difficult fun!  Now the person in the group who doesn&#039;t want to collaborate can go it alone against the rest.</comment>				</item>

Fortunately, that&#039;s only a bonus for me. This clearly has some ancestry from [thing=18602]Caylus[/thing], whether by design or happenstance, and that is a good thing.  I&#039;m not thrilled by the amount of text one must constantly digest, nor am I delighted by being able to throw &quot;blockers&quot; (Mandatory Quests) at people; however, having to seed action spaces with resources — sorry, &quot;adventurers&quot; (colored cubes) — creates some interesting dynamics.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>2009-03-05: [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b] Between the double deck, double the players, and unevenly distributed bonus tiles (i.e. the player who lucks into all of a certain color will do better than the others), this inflates the playtime, and deflates the joy of [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing].  I&#039;m sorry to say it.  :(  I do think the [thing=34585]Keltis[/thing] rules are better:  Since the values of the cards only matter for sequencing (not for points as in [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing]), why not let a player choose her direction of play (which works quite well, and provides its own agonizing choices in [gameid=39704])?  ...and to play three rounds of a game that&#039;s already going to take several times as long?  No thanks.
If you&#039;re going to get this one, choose the look you like, then play by the [thing=34585]Keltis[/thing] rules; however, if your tastes match mine, play it once to convince yourself - and play it by the [thing=34585]Keltis[/thing] rules to convince yourself in 1/3 the time.

2011-04-09: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] This [u]is[/u] better playing by the [[thing=34585]Keltis[/thing]] variant that allows you to choose for each expedition whether it goes up or down.  I suspect that if it&#039;s played at full speed, with people actually making next turn&#039;s choice immediately after they finish this turn, that it could be fully fun!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 7.50

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>The exploration in this is superb fun!  There are a few slight vaguenesses in the rules which your group will need to make agreements on, but no show-stoppers.  For instance, no more than one prospector can be on an intersection of tiles, and no more than two if that intersection is along the river bank:  Can you pass through that &quot;full&quot; intersection, though, as long as you don&#039;t stop there.  To us, &quot;Yes&quot; seems a very sensible answer.  There are  plenty of angles you can take on this game in order to try to excel, so in addition to the exploration itself making each game fresh, the number of strategies available, as well, should make every game of this interesting to play.

After our first playing of it, one of the other players said, &quot;Honey, I have a new game I want to get.&quot;</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Simple, quick game of strategy and tactics.  Once of its more interesting traits is that the game is mostly linear.
Despite its Chinese look, its movement mechanism is reminiscent of one that drives the Mancala family of African games.
...and like those games, it permits a pure, abstract strategy-and-tactics game to be quick, accessible, and fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>16</numplays>			<comment>I am increasingly impressed with Rüdiger Dorn as a game designer.  Louis XIV provides enough &quot;noise&quot; in the game to keep the struggle for influence and benefits interesting in replays.

Also, thankfully, despite what I&#039;d been told - &quot;It&#039;s a game that takes 45 minutes to teach and 20 mintues to play&quot; - it was untrue.  I read the rules, which may have taken 45 minutes, but then taught the game in 15 minutes.  I think the education would have gone better but slower if I&#039;d instead just had us all play a face-up demo round.  Also, needless to say (since the game is rated at 75-100 minutes), Louis XIV did not take 20 minutes to play.  Perhaps I need a better ability to detect hyperbole.  ;^)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Fortunately, I got to play the second release of this, which never quite got released.  A friend got the updates from Matt, and printed them dodgily monochromatically, which no doubt caused more digging through the rules than ordinarily would be necessary.

Nonetheless, this game is like the child of Formula Dé and Car Wars, raised by the nanny, RoboRally.  Lunatix Loop — with six players, and on the track we used, anyway — provides nice, tight, narrow tracks with plenty of single-lane spots, both in short cuts and on the main track, which kept the car interaction quite high.  Though I zipped into a strong lead in the second half of the game, at the end, 5/6 of us were serious contenders.  (Don&#039;t worry:  I squeaked out the win by a fraction of a turn.)  Alas, we were not playing with two-player teams, but all seemed to have a good time.

Though the game looked interesting, I was surprised by just how fun it turned out to be!

Matt, may your next reprint attempt go smoothly and thoroughly, so Lunatix Loop can get the fanbase it deserves!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>16</numplays>			<comment>Ooh, brilliant logistical, speculative, gambling agony!

Macao is a great one for the masochist in all of us.  Its core mechanism is a heptagon for each player, depicting the six values on a die, and an arrow.  There are six colors of [i]action cubes[/i], and the corresponding six dice in those same colors.  Each of the twelve turns, the dice are rolled, and each player may take cubes according to two dice of her choice.  If I choose the 5 that rolled on the blue die and the 2 that rolled on the red die, I take 5 blue, and put them outside the 5 position of my heptagon, and put 2 red outside the 2 position of my heptagon.  Next, the heptagon rotates clockwise, and the action cubes at which it points are my very ephemeral supply for this turn.  Those are the only ones I can use this turn, and this is the only turn I can use them — leftovers get discarded.  The other thing that happens each round, and before the dice are rolled, is a forced draft of one card per player.  Those cards have costs of 1-4 cubes in 1-4 colors.  Of course, our dear Stefan likes to motivate the players through punishment, so you are punished every time you let those cards accumulate too much on your board (i.e. without &quot;activating&quot; — buying — them).  There are two other types of punishment, as well.  The good part is that the cards you activate are yours to use for the rest of the game, and they enable you to do special things.

Macao is a game that encourages repeated plays to try out different methodologies, and because there are dice involved (as well as opponents, of course), it may take several tries just to execute one methodology successfully.  In the first four days after opening it, we&#039;d already played it three times.  It would have been four, but we were too sleepy the third day from starting it late at night the first two....

One &quot;issue&quot; this has in common with [thing=31594][/thing] is that you [-]basically must[/-] almost need to vie for start player.  [-]You can&#039;t[/-] It can be tricky to win off the table scraps.  Knowing that, however, play and have fun!

Another problem is that, due to the tactical nature of the individual turns, there&#039;s a little more downtime than I would prefer; however, it&#039;s not too bad.</comment>				</item>

However, I also think [person=1]Schmiel[/person] has pretty well nailed the feel of an election process.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I think this is rather fun. Standard mode adds more strategy to your scoring choices, but I&#039;m not super fond of palming the scoring discs. The trouble is that the extra components, setup, and fiddliness of the standard-mode scoring thingies don&#039;t really provide enough extra oomph to be worth it. That is to say that the basic mode is slightly less fun, but significantly quicker to whip out, score, and play. Basic for fun filler, standard when you feel like messing with the… mess.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.00

On the other hand, once you get into their mindset, the only things that make the clues more difficult are unfamiliarity with the phrase they&#039;ve mutated, and their clues being more of a stretch from the proper pronunciation:  For instance &quot;...ch howled&quot; being &quot;...child&quot; - maybe if you have a serious twang in your pronunciation.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Magic Treasure, as written, gives the players no choices, and the limited choices in the Sunshine Game are countered by penalties that undo what strategy there could have been.  Both are quite salvageable with house rules.  Nonetheless, the pieces are all big plywood tiles with rather nice graphics on them, and are excellent developmental toys.  My 20½-month-olds played for half an hour or more, saying and signing what all the pictures depict, stacking the tiles, laying them out in a row, and seeing just how many they could hold in each hand at once (it looked like about 6 in each of the hands of the one whose hands are a good 30% smaller!).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>While you are into the game, willing to collect cards - be they physical or virtual - and studying its strategies and interactions, this game is completely fun and addictive.  Building decks will appeal strongly to your inventive side.  It&#039;s easy to go broke if you do both real and online cards.  You can&#039;t give up the real, because they&#039;re something you can physically use.  You can&#039;t give up the virtual because online, you can play any time, purchase any time, compete in tournaments any time - you get the idea.  Much of the illustrations are rather nice, as well, just to add to the sting.

Once its tendrils loosen their grip on your soul, however, you can pretty easily lose all motivation to play any more.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is a silly, roll-and-move race, driven by a draft of characters before the races, and CCG-style ability interactions.  I would prefer if there were more characters, because as it is, you will see the same characters over the course of a game.  Although the combinations will vary, it reduces the feeling of freshness on subsequent plays.  The illustrations are cute and fun!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Between the die-rolling and the weighted paper-rock-scissors dueling mechanism, this game feels pretty random.  If you don&#039;t waste your &quot;big guns&quot; early on, the game plays pretty nicely, for what it is, until you get to the final oracle.  The rules basically specify that the final oracle can only be scored by the 1/6 chance on the die (presumably unless someone saves one of the summoning spells for just this purpose).  More importantly, the final one does not score when it fills.  This means that the final oracle almost invariably turns into a slugfest of players randomly replacing or eliminating each other&#039;s influence around the oracle until Maginor steps on it due to the magical die roll.  The effect is that it feels like the last oracle lasts as long as all ten of the others.  All in all, a very mildly amusing game, but best played inattentively.</comment>	<conditiontext>Donated to needy family.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>19</numplays>			<comment>A brilliantly agonizing K/K game.  Mistakes feel way more torturous than in most games I&#039;ve played.  Yet despite my first three turns of my first game being almost exclusively mistakes, I nearly needed a tie-breaker with first place.  (I was second :^)  I noticed similar disasters and recoveries, though of far smaller scale, from my opponents; so, this seems to be a very trickily balanced game.
This game thrills me every time I play it.  Superb!</comment>				</item>

This is a die-rolling game that has barricade mechanisms that feel like they came from a luckless game.  The combination is not bad.</comment>				</item>

Other than that, this is a suspenseful game of trying to acquire pattern-rewarding cards and set up rewarding patterns on a shared board.  I take special delight in the parallelogram tiles (though I&#039;m sure they could annoy some).  Andrea Meyer has provided good, tense choices as you take cards, speculating that you can use them, and choose between building the patterns you want or &quot;cashing in&quot; on the patterns that will have formed (and not been invalidated, in the early part of the game).  Strategies to unload cards that have become undesirable (you can&#039;t discard unless a card is literally unplayable), to play the cards you want to play, and to generate liquid assets are fun to discover and figure out.  My appreciation is growing on this one.  The rulebook makes the rules a lot tougher to understand than they could be.  I intend to provide a summary for new players, as well as a pick-it-up-after-a-year-on-the-shelf summary, so people can enjoy this interesting game!</comment>				</item>

For some reason, I really like the dodgy graphics.  They (and the Z-Man publication) are what drew me to this game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>This is a brilliant family game!!  It&#039;s disturbingly cute, and with proper creative dialog between the ladybugs, it&#039;s quite hilarious for little kids when a ladybug refuses to swap colors.  Additionally, with the distraction of children, it can actually be a little challenging to keep track of which ladybug likes which, an effect that is enhanced by ladybugs bowing out after they&#039;ve gotten four other colors.  In other words, you don&#039;t necessarily expose all the information quickly.  In a family setting with at least one little kid (my two are 2Â¾ at this stage), this is a very fun little game!  Also, except for a spinner that serves to randomly select a ladybug to go swapping and to provide tension from the game&#039;s enemy AI, the game is entirely choices and memory.</comment>				</item>

Sure, we&#039;re vying for victory points, but with vague feints and confrontations and - it just nearly totally lacked tension.  The big suspense in the game was flipping over the guardian&#039;s card to see if you&#039;d beaten it.  Yes, that&#039;s as exciting as flipping a card over.  Woo.  Hopefully, on another play, it can be smooth and fast, and strategy and motivation might become evident.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The biggest detriment to this game is playing it with someone deliberate or slow.  Employ a timer to limit people&#039;s turns, and you are set.  The challenges of the shifting labyrinth and trying to synchronize your turns with the ingredients on your recipe (which provide a heavy bonus) make this a very fun game, provided you play with respectful turn lengths.  I rather enjoy the provision of the lore behind each item, as well.  We rarely play without reading those aloud as we go for a new item.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Interesting game with quite the market fluctuation elements.  It&#039;s prone to human error in the bookkeeping, and a little tedious to keep up; however, as a computer implementation, it should be pretty interesting.  The complexity would still be there, and the players would need to understand what things their choices would affect in the market, but it would take significantly less time to play....</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s an interesting idea, and I appreciate the attempt to map Neuromancer to a solitaire piecepack game.  Full marks for that.

[b]Basic game[/b]:  [b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4 [/bgcolor][/b]
Unfortunately, the basic game just doesn&#039;t present interesting decisions to the player.  You can make statistical guesses about which pawn should make the next move, but the possibilities all collapse to whichever tile comes off the top of the deck.  Then, you are compelled to attack whatever it is, and the attack is a die roll.  You may choose to boost it with coins you&#039;ve accumulated, but being able to take 10 points of brain damage means that there is no real incentive to do so until you hit 9:  Save them for the forts.

[b]Advanced game[/b]: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b]
The advanced game allows you to assign special powers to your icebreaker pawns, which already makes the game setup for the advanced game more interesting than the entire base game.  Each pawn ability adds decisions to the game, and the pawn synergy makes the game combo-licious.  For example, in my first advanced game, I used Black Diamond, Flatline Dix, Sliver Virus, and Dub Lattice.  Dub Lattice plus Flatline Dix is just a powerhouse, if you take a hint from Dub&#039;s moniker, and layout the matrix in a lattice.  Sliver paved the way over rough spots, and although Black Diamond&#039;s ability is quite potent, I never even found it worth using, due to the others&#039; abilities.  The advanced game is where there&#039;s value in playing Matrix.  The advanced game is what infuses the game with its great theme.  You use your set of icebreakers like a set of lockpicks, strategically combining their abilities to your best advantage.
Additionally, because each of the four colors of pawn has six customization options, you get a little deck-building effect (1,296 combinations gives you some extra replay value).  Furthermore, you can enhance the replayability by rolling each suit&#039;s die to determine which icebreaker its pawn represents for that game, forcing you to use the tools at your disposal for an expert experience.

My advice:  If you play this, plow on through to the advanced rules and start with an advanced game.  Please, do not waste your time with the basic game.  Matrix (advanced) is a very interesting solitaire game.  I&#039;m glad I forced myself to re-try the game with the advanced rules!

Finally, the &quot;expert&quot; (random icebreaker) rules could make this a perfectly decent collaborative game, each person controlling one icebreaker, and playing in turn.  It would be more difficult than the solitaire game, but I think that&#039;s appropriate for a cooperative game.

[b]WARNING:[/b]  The rules are pretty dodgy as written.  Here&#039;s a correction guide for the instructions, which are expressed too thematically for having zero illustrations therein:
pon → pawn
contiguous → adjacent
ice breaker → pawn
ice breaker breaker → pawn
data structure → tile
fort or ice → tile
fort → null tile
ice → non-null tile
An ice breaker in the matrix is contiguous to the four cardinal spaces (located up, down, left, and right). Diagonal spaces are not contiguous to an ice breaker in the matrix. All spaces in the matrix are contiguous to an ice breaker that is outside the matrix. -&gt; Adjacency is only orthogonal, not diagonal; however, pawns outside the matrix are considered adjacent to any space in the matrix.

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>Interesting competition between the players, and against themselves as they swill their currency to get more.  Good challenge!  The lack of clear labeling on the board looks cool to a passerby, but is rubbish for play, however.  The budgeting choices as you bid on the one-time-around auctions carry some interesting subtleties with them, which lend a lot to this game.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>So far, the French Lui-même edition seems best, though I&#039;m hopeful that RGG&#039;s new edition in the same look as Medici vs. Strozzi is good.  Update:  It is MUCH better, but the tiles make it difficult to exclude 12 goods for 4 players (for example).</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>It has some good mechanisms.  Medievalia elegantly tweaks the Magic: The Gathering concept for a non-collectible, 2-4p game, neatly eliminating crazy combo/loophole situations brought on by card text.  It&#039;s just too confrontational for my tastes, but I&#039;d heartily recommend it to those who enjoy conflict with their opponents.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m playing the web version at one turn per day, so I grant that playing Menhir physically, in person, with friends probably lends a bit more excitement to it.  Still, this game seems to have something subtle going on under its simple surface.

Basically, each player has as many cards as there are seasons.  Each card has very different uses and efficacy during the different seasons, but can be used to acquire 0-4 new seeds, plant 0-4 of your seeds, or swipe some of an opponent&#039;s seeds.  There are some rules of precedence governing which action takes effect first, but you mostly are trying to maximize the utility your particular cards provide (e.g. your rainbow root may be very potent in summer, so you may plan to use it then), while protecting your seeds (it doesn&#039;t do any good to get gobs of seeds just so your opponents can steal them).  A very tricky factor of the game is that plants are what matter - seeds are only tie-breakers.  So, maybe you can get 4 seeds in the last season, but since they would only act as stealables on that last turn, or tie-breakers if you get to keep them (or gambling fodder), perhaps you would do better to use that ingredient to affect a smaller number of seeds in a more significant way.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Tentative rating based on one play: [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] — Because I dove into the first game without taking the time to analyze the way it all cascaded and worked, I had a hard time comprehending how to be competitive.  That said, my opponents thought (from looking at my current contracts) that I could have been contending for the win, rather than far in last place (with about half their scores), because I had the highest contract out of everyone.  This was quick, and I&#039;m itching to play it again, because while I don&#039;t think I &quot;get it&quot; yet, I do think I have a much better sense of things to try next time.  I am guessing this game will end up being an [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] for me, because I really like the mechanisms and the challenge in this.

Oh, and the first edition [b]really[/b] needs a frame to go around the boards, holding them together, because the &quot;built-in&quot; storage bins mean the split board is constantly bumped around while people dig for the bits they need.  The installed storage bins are a great idea, especially that you take the player summaries and such out of the holes (very efficient), but needed a little more to make them work.  Also, I agree with Paul Grogan that it is most unfortunate that the locations are represented by frames with all their information therein... and then you&#039;re supposed to cover that information with cubes.  I would (and perhaps shall) go a step farther than Paul did, and put the name, the time cost, and the tag-along time cost [b]outside[/b] the square, leaving only the cube type indication inside the box, since as it&#039;s covered, it&#039;s replaced by that very same kind of cube.  [imageid=838456]

One final gripe about the production in the first edition:  There is some warping that occurred with the player boards, even though they look like they&#039;re done the same way as the [thing=31260][/thing] boards.  Because their backside isn&#039;t an alternate display of the same information (like [person=11507][/person] did with [thing=31260][/thing] and [thing=39683][/thing]), you can&#039;t just flip it over.  So, I sat there the whole game with my board wanting to spin.  It certainly doesn&#039;t wreck the experience, but it was disappointing.

I&#039;d love to see these kinks worked out for a second edition, so I can buy this with pride, and feel my money is not only going to great people for a great game, but is also spent on a quality end product.  As it is, I intend to buy this, once its price is like [thing=39683]Loyang[/thing]&#039;s has become ([b]half[/b] what folks were charging for it right after Spiel), and then print up one or more alternate boards for it, which is a shame, because I adore the [b]concept[/b] of the installed bins.  That, or I make a frame for it, and cut out overlays to make the board&#039;s layout more functional for play.

Oh, and then there&#039;s the small mistake with the Alsterhaus.  Come on, excellent second edition!  ;)  (But that means I need everyone else to be sure the first edition sells out. :ninja: )

Indeed, on a second play, with my wits about me to play strategically, this has risen to an [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b], and may yet rise a little more.  Excellent game, but surfing the card opportunities can be tricky!

As for solitaire play, as with [thing=39683][/thing], the solo game involves delightful, torturous mechanisms that aren&#039;t in the multiplayer game, making it a different experience that will make my eyes light up with images of [thing=39684][/thing] when I&#039;m left alone....

[b]Update:[/b]  You can easily combat the board warpage by facing the boards toward each other before putting them back in the ribbon loop, and load the rest of the bits atop them.  Mine all sit quite flat now!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>What I said with my [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff]&amp;nbsp;5.9&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] rating, and the pre-Mayfair rulebook: Moving nimbly and nicking your opponents&#039; goods when you could have picked one up elsewhere will take you far.  Something about this game doesn&#039;t quite gel for me, though.  Hopefully, if I actually get to play two games in a row with the same ruleset (most inelegant rules I&#039;ve seen since Africa), Mesopotamia will click, and I&#039;ll enjoy it again.

Now, yes, the rules are solid and probably as fair as a randomized, exploratory game can get.  This is a good game, with interesting, tough choices and gambles.  Mayfair REALLY cleaned up the rulebook!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>17</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;ve played a decent number of two-player games of this, and it&#039;s a delicious game of tricking your opponent into helping you get what you want, while hoping that you&#039;re not stuck with one of the stepping/bluffing stones along the way, and that your opponent doesn&#039;t obstruct your plans.  With three or four players, the dynamics are a bit different, but it&#039;s — well, different, but equally good.  You can feel like you&#039;re not participating in the game, but it usually leads to consecutive, stronger strikes later.</comment>				</item>

It can be difficult enough to remember all the actors in a logic puzzle, but then to name them all with the same starting consonant cluster?!?!?  The questions themselves are pretty good, if you can get around the transic, hypnotic effect of all that alliteration with regards to character names.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The start of the game often feels a little nebulous, as you look at your mess of a hand, and decide what to do with it; however, as the game progresses, the mind races, looking for hyperactively cascading combos.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Limited resources, and the movement and promotion of pieces, whose movement options vary based on the terrain and the situation, make this descendant of Go-moku intense and interesting.  Basic pieces on &quot;land&quot; can move orthogonally one space, or jump a line of adjacent, contiguous opposing pieces orthogonally or diagonally.  Basic pieces in the &quot;water&quot; move orthogonally one space, or orthogonally along unobstructed water as far as they like.  Once a piece has moved, it is experienced, and can move one space diagonally, in addition to the basic capabilities.  Five in a row still wins, but (to me) it is a much more interesting trek in Miracle Five than it is in Go-moku.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m not sure how much longevity there is in this title, but it&#039;s a fun, challenging chess descendant.  One of the trickier aspects is remembering that permitting yourself to see something in one of your mirrors permits your opponent to see the piece you just moved.  Another key skill is deduction:  By granting yourself a view of enough pieces, you can deduce what color seal pieces are, and take them out.  Very cool, and I&#039;d like to play it more.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>I adore the utterly closed system of the game.  No money in or out.  The ever-crashing stock market provides very interesting challenges.  I&#039;m sure it helps that in my first game, I was 2 points ahead of all the other players, who were tied... until the money was counted up, and one player beat out another by one bill, taking first place by one point.  Nonetheless, Moderne Zeiten is fun every time I play it, and I keep wanting to play it yet again.  Brilliant fun!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>A very interesting game, entirely composed of making strange trades with the board to try to reach a goal value.

The colors in [thing=2184]The First Million[/thing] (a later incarnation) are matched complementarily and intuitively (though the print run could have better distinguished them), which is an improvement over [thing=1520][/thing]&#039;s weird pairings of colors.

There is just something kind of fascinatingly mechanical, yet opportunistic about this game.</comment>	<conditiontext>pristine 3M Gamette</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I like that there are numerous primates from which to choose, and that each has its own traits and abilities.  The fact that your options in this direct combat are driven by the five cards in your hand, with just a simple play-and-draw approach, didn&#039;t really engage me much in the game.  I do feel that Ben believably mapped each primate with a representative special ability, though.  I could see this game being some mindless fun, but in my opinion it relies too much on the players delighting in picturing apes fighting and flinging things at each other.  Sometimes imagining jumping onto someone, and then kicking them, amused me a little, I must confess, but I think this one&#039;s just not for me.</comment>				</item>

They gave you three guys matching each property&#039;s color set, so I think it would be easy to make better rules for integrating this with Monopoly, but you&#039;d also need to use the game differently:  The shovel whacking the jail floor is complete rubbish.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 4.00

The physical mechanisms are pretty cool, but there is still loose paper money to contend with :what:, and without any real escalation, the game just goes on until people quit, really.  Worse, little money leaves the game.  Many of the expenditures go to Loose Change, which the players win back.  :shake:</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Monopoly, when played without adding more money into the system (through the common house rules, or players forgiving rent owed), but with much negotiation and deal-making, is rather fun.  The last game I played of it was not unlike most games of Monopoly for me:  At one point in the game, every, every, every single property, including utilities, had some kind of profit-splitting deal on it.  My favorites were the two groups owned by two different sets of three of the five players, with some warped ownership/upgrade arrangement.  Thankfully, I wasn&#039;t part of those two, so I didn&#039;t need to understand it in great detail.  ;^)

Monopoly is often villified by people who consider themselves &quot;gamers&quot;.  Play it correctly (just read the bloody rules) and with vim, and it&#039;s astonishing how much fun you can have with it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Interesting concept, and plays very quickly.  Since &quot;trading&quot; happens by way of swapping discards, this means if you have a handful of crap, you can&#039;t unload it.  This game mostly reminds me of Mah Jongg, actually, except that you don&#039;t need specifically four sets and a pair to call Mah Jongg - I mean lay your hand down.  Since we play Monopoly with gobs of crazy negotiation, I think that some form of negotiation and buying from each other would spruce this up a bit.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>The weather-dependent Park, the weather- and ship-dependent Pier, the neighbor-dependent Restaurant, and the luck-dependent Casino provide some interesting improvement options.  Since there are only 3 or 4 of each, players still have to rely on the traditional improvements&#039; analogs if they want to vie for the win.  The DVD interaction can slow things down a little, but once you no longer care about the vignettes, you can skip them easily enough.  The player roles also spice things up a little.  I&#039;m not sure I like the particular implementation of the starting title deeds, but the idea is quite sound, except that there is no real way to balance them.</comment>				</item>

For instance, instead of each player have cards 1-6, each player has 1-18, and any card you play is out until all your cards are used up (3 rounds) - now that would be more the bluffing game they bragged it to be.  At least it&#039;s a very quick game to play in its published form.</comment>	<conditiontext>Sold! $2</conditiontext>			</item>

First off, it&#039;s obviously a way to whisk a character up to 8 spaces along the board - even where there are no manholes available.
Secondly, it&#039;s a handy way to keep a character&#039;s ability from getting used that round (moving a cordon, for instance).
Thirdly, it&#039;s a mobile obstruction that you can use to keep a character from an exit, a manhole, or possible accusers.
Fourthly, it&#039;s a herder that you can use to gather characters together.
Fifthly, it&#039;s a disperser that can run through an otherwise inseparable clump of characters, sending them this way and that.
Did I miss anything?
In short, it feels right at home in the dynamic game of cat and mouse that we call &quot;[thing=21763]Mr. Jack[/thing]&quot;.</comment>	<conditiontext>with spielbox 4/2007</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>First off, this looks great, with its lush colors and cute mushrooms.

The rules sound pretty basic and unexciting; however, once you and your opponent start manipulating where the basket can and can&#039;t go, you see that the charm of this game runs deeper than the toxicity of the red &#039;shrooms. It&#039;s fun and vindictive (the latter being a trait I only like in simple, 2-player games like this)!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Wow!  The mutation really alters one&#039;s collection philosophies, and the gene-code cards, like the order cards in the second edition of the first expansion set, tempt the player to perform odd stunts just to get a little bonus money.  I have seen a player ignore the bonus cards and their bean-pennies, and even almost never mutate fields, and compete soundly with old-school bean-dollars from homogenous fields.  I have also, however, seen quite a profit from bean-pennies.</comment>				</item>

2012-12-24: The escalating difficulty balancing mechanism works really well.  Playing against someone new to the genre, who had but a tentative grasp of how it would play out, victory was only by two meeples, and it was getting close!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 8.10

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>As a two-player game, a more experienced person will thrash a newcomer every time.  That said, I think there is a solid and interesting system here.  Aspects of it are reminiscent of Louis XIV, but the decisions seem more make-or-break in Mykerinos.  With three players, there&#039;s a little more leeway, but the competition for plurality is fiercer.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>The base game provides a carefully chosen array of units, permitting deduction and clever play.  Be sure both players are sitting nice and high, otherwise, you also can use a [thing=94140][/thing] strategy.  [i][ahem][/i]  I was a little surprised to notice this while I was low and pondering from the units&#039; perspective.  Quickly, I sat upright, because those lovely acrylic backs give a spectacular reflection of enemy units that are &quot;behind&quot; them.

I look forward to trying the variability provided by the expansion variants and units!</comment>				</item>

The unfortunate part of this game is that you could just wing it in a &quot;don&#039;t care&quot; way, and have absolutely no fun playing it.  On the other hand, if you let the theme grab you, it&#039;s a fun game of misdirecting suspicion while trying to identify the various players.  Sadly, there&#039;s no bonus for correctly identifying the other players, other than increasing the evidence against them.  (Sadly, because in my first game, I correctly identified both of the other players - hee hee hee - good educated guesses, really, but it still was gratifying.)</comment>	<conditiontext>Like new

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s no joke:  This game takes about one minute to play.  You seriously will want to make use of the doubling cube if you are actually sitting and playing it.

On the other hand, since it&#039;s the size of an Altoids tin, and smaller than my wallet, I could keep it with me at all times to fill several-minute voids, as long as someone is willing to play it with me.  ...and the game doesn&#039;t even rattle audibly in my pocket, because of the baffle (&quot;rattle-stop&quot;) inside the tin.

For a game so very portable and quick, with the doubling cube, it&#039;s actually quite fun!  I played 4 games while gabbing and eating breakfast, and several evil little doubles were accepted, including one that backfired on the offerer.

If you keep this handy (e.g. pocket), it is totally worth the purchase price, because you can play it just about anywhere.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is an interesting, unusual game that I&#039;m sure will be much more exciting to play once you get the rules down pat.  It&#039;s super-fast, but gives plenty of room for tactics, and a little room for strategy.  Yes, you are a bit at the mercy of the deck of cards; however, you are more at the mercy of the fact that the evil card you want to play on that player matches that player&#039;s color, and thus is -1 as effective against her.  On the other hand, cards of your color are +1 as effective, which can lead to some really nasty plays.  Still, if your cards don&#039;t suit your situation, you could feel a little helpless.  In a long game, this would be terrible.  In this quickie, it&#039;s probably just going to make you demand a rematch….

Also, I hear a rumor that the players have picked up defensive options since last I played….</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>This is a very nice half-breed of the chess family of games.  The fact that you start the game with a Navia and 9 Gulleds (soldiers/pawns) on the board, but all your powerful pieces have to be summoned (for free) is interesting enough.  However, saving up resources (Gyullas) to enable Dratping (promoting) units is a fascinating element to the strategy.  I won my first game by saving up all 60 Gyullas, getting my Navia well out of check, and then spending the 60 for a Navia Dratp to win.  Rather interesting!</comment>	<conditiontext>includes all maseitai</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Pro: Closed money system, which can lead to clever manipulation of your opponents.
Pro: The board has certain spaces where the buildings can only grow one high; however…
Con: The way the one-story spaces are indicated — with a picket fence around them — is cute and clever when the board is empty, but too easy not to notice when it starts to fill.  It is a minor inconvenience.
Pro: The bidding and placement are much more interesting than I predicted.  Often you are bidding on things in which you have no vested interest because you can place them in ways that are probably damaging to your opponents.
Con: The game can end with you very surprised to have a big negative score.  It provides suspense, but it can give you a bit of a feeling of having accomplished nothing.

This is a rather unusual 3D building game with bidding and manipulation of the players and the playfield, made with excellent bits.  Definitely worth playing, with the minor risk that you don&#039;t savor one of the elements of the game.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 7.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Reading the rules, I was dismayed by how similar it was to stock [gameid=822]; however, play proved that the subtle changes were quite nice.  It&#039;s [gameid=822] with a sense of urgency provided by the surveyors.  Additionally, they provide greater opportunities for gambling, while helping new players get their ill-placed meeples back.  That is, unless they&#039;ve turned them all into trappers....
If you already have another [family=2]Carcassonne family[/family] base game (except [thing=12902]The City[/thing] or [thing=7717]The Castle[/thing], since they&#039;re bound by walls), you can adopt the surveyor rules and have no need to purchase this.  Otherwise, this would make a fine starting point - especially if you want to avoid the expansionitis of [gameid=822].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Pretty decent light wargame.  Though it&#039;s nice that each turn you get another secret potential source of victory points, since you draw them randomly, they may all be infeasible for your situation in the game.  Perhaps what I most appreciate about this game is that it is a streamlining of this sort of game, yet with a modular map to keep things varied from game to game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Yay!!!!  It has a table of contents, [b]and[/b] all my components are correct!!!!

This is a pretty fun family game of digging for items that need to be moved to particular rooms.  There are some player-bashing and stealing mechanisms, but all such elements are one-shot effects that leave the game after you play them, so it doesn&#039;t drag on.  Although the effect on gameplay isn&#039;t drastic, I adore that you can lay out the house however you like.  Again, [company=7585][/company] has provided an unusual but fun design in a small box!

Sadly, the rulebook is lacking numerous explicit statements to clarify the game, so the game spent about 2 minutes total on the table the entire time we played, while every single one of us five players looked through it constantly for answers that weren&#039;t there.  One of the finer examples (in both Spanish and English) pertains to the three items that belong in a room:  The first gives you 2 points, the second gives you 4, and the third gives you 8, so if you have all three, you get 12 points.  :what:  Errors like that in the rules turned the game into a wad of house rules that approximated [thing=63672][/thing], but we still enjoyed the game, inasmuch as we guessed [person=10313][/person]&#039;s intent correctly.

Unlike the other [company=7585][/company] I&#039;ve played, the English translation in [thing=63672][/thing] does not match the Spanish thoroughly, and omits or changes a number of crucial phrases, such as the effects of winning a duel.  As a game translator myself, I suspect that there were numerous late revisions to the rules, and the two languages just got out of sync.  Then the final versions weren&#039;t cross-checked.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Criminy, this is tricky and can be brutal.  Money is scarce, scarce, scarce.  The bank is only going to give you 9 Talers that you can use (and 3 more after the last turn, which could affect your score).  Everything else you earn is good, old-fashioned &quot;buy low, sell high&quot;.  ...and there are a host of interesting mechanisms for you to jockey for goods that you can use for that purpose, and to directly acquire townsfolk (trying to have the highest total value in each guild), and indirectly acquire them with their crest (and if you&#039;re good, the prestige crest for the round, too).  I can&#039;t do this game justice with a quick description, but I haven&#039;t stopped thinking about it since I played it.  I&#039;m ready to take it on again (and my rating might well go up, now that I&#039;ve had time to sort my thoughts how to play it).</comment>				</item>

In one game, I captured all but one of my opponent&#039;s pieces in one or two turns.  Obvious victory, right?  My opponent managed to keep just one move out of my reach, repopulate, and win, in a matter of maybe 5 more turns.  Very cool.  Who has ever won a game of [international] chess or xiang qi with only one piece left?</comment>				</item>

You mainly conduct goods into your freight pile in the most optimal order you can while managing your money, cards, and actions as efficiently as possible.  It also really does work with two players:  It didn&#039;t feel much different, other than the acceptance that one player is ahead on prestige, so the other can do well to exploit the position, rather than trying to &quot;catch up&quot; in prestige.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>This is an interesting, fast-paced (AP notwithstanding) game, with plenty of parallel ways to compete, but plenty of opportunities for the players to be pounded by each other and by the gods.  As in [thing=60][/thing], [thing=40692][/thing], and [thing=97786][/thing], there is constant conquest with guaranteed success.  In [thing=92319][/thing], not only is your population a resource you must mind, but so is time, in the sense of a [i]time track[/i], as in [thing=13883][/thing] / [thing=30869][/thing], [thing=35570][/thing], [thing=12681][/thing], etc.  There are developments your civilization can make (e.g. military strength, or general piety) to facilitate aspects of the game for you, and the precise costs for those are randomized (within parameters) each game.  Additionally, high-point-value wonders&#039; costs are reduced by first accomplishing developments that happen to be in the same column this particular game.

This is a solid effort, with plenty of replay value.  The beatdown from the gods for being least pious can feel excessive, but I can testify that being the butt of their joke doesn&#039;t necessarily keep you from winning.  Because there&#039;s more riding on it than [thing=40692][/thing]&#039;s thin point-scoring mechanism, being conquered can also be more frustrating, but since your populace can remain, dominated, in that region, and uprising is just a turn away, again granting you access to the quarry, or whatever, that you were so frustrated to lose.

Finally, I&#039;d been watching [person=12886][/person]&#039;s art for this since before either the name [i]Olympos[/i] or [i]Atlantys[/i] were associated with it, hoping against hope that all these lush paintings would be for a game that was to my tastes.  Lucky me!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Solid game that I want to play more, and the art is stupendous.

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>OtU is a tricky tactical game, with a subtle but brutal dose of strategy to it.  I have an extra fascination for it, since the game plays out the creation and extension of underground lines.  Well done, Sebastian!  Just be wary of playing this with a very think-out-loud person - especially one who simply must advise every player, for better or worse.  This game is a breeding ground for such &quot;helpers&quot;, and they really, really slow it down.

As a bonus, almost everything you need to remember about your turn is printed in a summary on the board.  (The &quot;big&quot; omission:  The cost to branch is TWO branch tokens.  Don&#039;t forget it!)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>This is a very nice game!  The movement mechanism gives you two options:  [b]walk[/b] one space (no climbing!), or [b]run[/b] any number of spaces in a straight line to a friendly piece, vault off its head, and [b]jump[/b] in that same direction, just as far as you ran; and, if you land on an opponent&#039;s head, you can jump again from there, and so on.  (I can&#039;t help but picture scenes from anime when I play this.)  This movement, coupled with the clever victory condition that you win if at the [b]beginning[/b] of your opponent&#039;s back row has more of your pieces than your back row does of hers, makes for a very interesting and unusual abstract gaming experience!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is a great concept for a game, and definitely produces entertainment proportional to people&#039;s twisted creativity, memory, and story integration skills.  Unfortunately, while you wait to break into the story, you have to keep scanning your cards &amp;#8212; cards which we have to stack vertically to see what they are, due to a strange card layout &amp;#8212; to catch that opportunity to break into the story.  Of course, while working so hard to break in, you miss details that would make your chunk of the story a smooth inclusion.  Also, once you blow most of your cards working toward your story end, you pretty much shoot your chances of actually reaching it if someone steals, or your ideas are exhausted temporarily.  This game would probably be an unstoppably good party game if the game were tweaked a little to disallow the hogging of a story &amp;#8212; Let&#039;s face it:  Anyone fairly creative can keep the story in their court indefinitely, as long as others don&#039;t steal, and once you are familiar with the sorts of cards in the game, your story can wend carefully around those terms and concepts that allow people to swipe control.  The Game Cabinet variant helps address the Screwed-at-the-End syndrome, but I look for someone (maybe me &amp;#8212; who knows? ;^) to solve the downtime problem of this game.
Finally, some people just aren&#039;t as good at telling stories, or making things up, as others, and keeping the game fairly handicapped can make it boring, while not handicapping frustrates and alienates </comment>				</item>

If you play with a 30-second timer (or shorter, ideally), and treat slow plays like no-match turns, it keeps the pace up, and elevates the excitement.</comment>				</item>

Racing the priests&#039; ship felt tense, especially because every single time it hit &quot;metal island&quot;, it was a high roll, and thus a gold. Nice!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.00

Nobody&#039;s fighting you for that settlement you want to build, because everyone has the same ones available; however, that means everyone&#039;s potentially scrabbling for the same resources and actions to make them happen.  Very cool.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.80

In fairness, I didn&#039;t see the rules myself, so they may have been misinterpreted in such a way as to detract from the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Yes, another draft, draft, draft… score, game over game (not that there&#039;s anything wrong with that); however, this one brings something fresh to the table.  When you draft, you take two characters and a story card (story card = scoring card).  Although you will take 8–9 of these trios, you will only keep 4 scoring cards, replacing them (or not) as you go.  [person=2762][/person], with his usual drive to do something unusual and interesting, has made the scoring/story cards thematic sets of characters, but with nicely compatible and/or conflicting scoring of the character cards you&#039;ve collected, with some specifically competitive scoring cards (e.g. no other player has more wicked witches than you, earn big points).  The net effect is that right out of the gate, you&#039;re making decisions that are challenging and increasingly complex, while not becoming overwhelming.  The combination of Emanuele&#039;s design proclivities and [person=47773][/person]&#039;s illustrations drew me to this game.  Everyone with whom I&#039;ve played it has enjoyed it, and has appreciated the bold re-imagining of the characters&#039; appearances in a style that is predominantly, but not entirely manga.</comment>				</item>

Seriously, there are scratch-and-sniff cards with smells to identify, but it&#039;s the usual very artificial scents, some of which are fairly accurate, others of which....  Before long, the aromas on the cards just commingle and bleed into even the unscented cards, making the game less useful than the aforementioned Candyland.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[b]Shacru[/b] — 2010-12-04: [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] This game is basically the Tron light cycles, in a turn-based game.  The differences:  You can go at a diagonal, which creates a gap in your wall that another &quot;cycle&quot; can go through.  The goal is to get the most cylinders on the board, but in practice that basically means staying alive the longest (although technically a blocked piece could get to move again, it&#039;s not a common occurrence).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>2012-09-14: [i](When playing with a mistaken rule that really diminished the experience.  Mistakes, and observations based thereupon, are scratched out herafter….)[/i] [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b] I love the concept:  I have started so many color-mixing game designs that it&#039;s ridiculous.  [-]The way it plays out is not particularly satisfying, though.[/-]  Smearing the led primary color, so that a secondary color wins the trick is thematically nice, and cruel to those who played/followed the led color.  [-]Part of the problem with[/-] the game [-]— which incidentally[/-] is impressively colorblind-friendly [-]— is that the traditional mandate to follow suit is extrapolated:  If you can&#039;t follow a secondary suit, you [b]must[/b] mix the requisite primaries to follow, if you can.  If you can&#039;t follow a primary suit, you [b]must[/b] smear by playing another primary and the resultant color, if you can.  This means that not only are your strategic options reduced through additional obligatory plays, but your cards are getting involuntarily burned twice as quickly.  Yes, you start to adjust your bids based on the realization that having one or two moderately big cards in a color probably means they&#039;ll just get bled out involuntarily; however, ultimately, you&#039;re even more buffeted by the waves of the current situation than you are in something like [thing=6901]Euchre[/thing].  In Euchre, your choices are so distilled that you can simply focus on those opportunities, and strike when you can.  In Pala, the added complexity just muddies the waters, and constrains the player more.[/-]

The [boardgameversion=126230]first edition[/boardgameversion] has excellent components: bright, beautiful cards, with the paint splotches shaped differently for each color, and the name of the color on the card; bold, tightly stacking bidding chips for each player (these aren&#039;t colorblind-friendly, but as long as there is one person in the group who is not colorblind, the worst it does is slow play slightly; if it&#039;s a problem, label them).  Of course, it still comes in the traditional, despicable plastic clamshell that is standard for [company=4569][/company].

To clarify, I do still wish to play this a little more, because I believe that the game could rise as high as a [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] for me, given dedicated opponents and opportunities to play.  …but I could be wrong.

Still, it&#039;s a very clever design!

2015-02-02: When I played this recently, I literally didn&#039;t even remember having played it before — perhaps because of the wrong rules.  Did I really flush my memory of them that thoroughly? Anyway, this does in fact seem like an interesting game I&#039;d like to play more; however, it was made painfully clear to us that this definitely should not be a young player&#039;s first trick-taking game: Angrily confused.  I think I like it, though.  :)  Tentative [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] for me.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.75

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This brilliant pentominoes game doesn&#039;t look like much, and its look doesn&#039;t do anything to set it apart from the squall of pentomino (and polyomino) games released since its 1960 debut; however, several things really make it work well:
:d10-1: You each have a full set of the 12 pentominoes to work with.  …and if you play competitively with even an inkling more competence than a gnat, you will have plenty of them left over.
:d10-2: Creating spaces that do not have a multiple of 5 squares in them guarantees that at least one piece won&#039;t have a home.
:d10-3: Creating spaces into which your opponent&#039;s remaining pieces can&#039;t fit will help maximize the number of those homeless pieces that are your opponent&#039;s.
:d10-4: Creating perfect 5-square spaces into which only one of [b]your[/b] remaining pieces fits gives you an advantage.
At the end of the game, the win goes to the player who placed the last piece; however, the rules welcome the winner to add insult to injury by continuing to place pieces.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Intricate and rather interesting to play.  Plenty of fun choices.  I just wish there were a short player aid of the more tedious bits e.g. in some of the leftover space on the board or on a player aid card, or something.  With several copies of the rules, so multiple players could look things up, things go pretty quickly, but it would be nice not to have to look.

Good stuff, though!  A singular experience, but with plenty of replay value.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.61

I think, however, that collaboratives aren&#039;t filling my sails much any more.  So, if you enjoy collaborative games, I totally recommend this.  You can&#039;t play a faster one.

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>First impression: Deck-building word game that rewards lateral thinking.  Score!  This matches the pace of [thing=36218][/thing] (provided you require people to play immediately when it&#039;s their turn, or employ a timer, and utilize the Bounty variant), with the satisfaction of a word game; however, instead of having to milk every last point out of each word, word values merely give you purchasing power.  While nonetheless important, this can give you enough wiggle room to get what you want without hurting yourself.  Also, the optional Theme cards, Player Power cards, and Award cards give the players more variety and challenges.

I can&#039;t wait to see the mobile digital version of this cracking game!

On the opposite end of a spectrum from the excellent [thing=39635][/thing], this word game uses just as much lateral thinking — no, more — but within the confines of the letters and wilds at your disposal.  You know, more like in [thing=320][/thing]; however, some of your cards have pairs of letters, and some have powers you want to employ.  …and rather than the values your words just scoring you points, instead they provide the currency you can use to buy new cards that turn.  Mechanically, it doesn&#039;t fall far from the [thing=36218][/thing] tree, but that is a really good thing:  It&#039;s a fast-paced, deckbuilding word game.

Between [thing=97690][/thing], [thing=71655][/thing], and [thing=141572][/thing], I&#039;m becoming such a [company=12549]gabob[/company] fanboy….</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.42

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Collect fragrance sources, distill them successfully with mutable die rolls, combine them into perfumes, then sell them to customers interested in their scents, and willing to pay what you want for them. There are nice trade-off mechanisms to make the game fun and interesting, and to make gambles exciting.

[i][b]Example:[/b] Reroll flies of one color, or every single die, for 1 water. …or just &quot;fix&quot; a single die for 2 water. Due to the fickle nature of dice, it can often enough end up being cheaper to spend the 2 water per die you need, but the gamble of 1 pays off enough to keep you trying it.[/i]

[i][b]Example:[/b] Waking up early can give you drastically fewer opportunities to find fragrances and distillations you need, but gives you first crack at taking the perfect distillation or customer… if you can pull it off with fewer chances.[/i]

I suspect that the planned expansions, as with Fresco, will add depth and satisfaction to the game without drastically complicating it.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 7.50

This game had a previous incarnation named &quot;Pig Mania&quot;, but all the internal components had the same names, such as the Pig Pen you use to write on the Pig Pad, and so forth.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>This is significantly more difficult that I would have guessed.  I definitely need to consider making player trays to hold 2 commissions, 2 hexagonal tiles, and 8+ little cards.  I like the game, though.  It is surprising at first to realize that secondary and tertiary colors are the easiest to get, while primaries are harder to acquire.  Fortunately, the cards have point values that suggest it&#039;s the case.

The manufacturing on this first edition is astounding.  The game weighed a ton, so I assumed there were a bunch of punchboards for the the hexes.  Wrong.  The hexes are already separate, and bagged nicely.  The commission cards are actually huge (3⅝&quot;×4⅛&quot;), thick (2mm) tiles.  The board and box are thick and sturdy, and the board lies perfectly, seamlessly flat on the first go.  There is even a box insert, perfectly designed to hold all the &quot;decks&quot;, with finger holes on both sides of each deck.  You certainly get your money&#039;s worth in production value!</comment>				</item>

For this one specifically:
:colonist: [b]Old-Timer 1899er[/b] Equipment encourages you to replace it. [shrug] Interesting enough.
:colonist: [b]Wabasha Well[/b] Claim gets better as the weather gets colder, encouraging you to play chicken with the thermometer….
:colonist: [b]Old-Fashioned Pans[/b] are an awesome Claim Gear, especially because they need fixed after a single use, but for a worker to do it is 50% waste of the worker&#039;s repair talents.
:colonist: [b]I&#039;m Too Old for This S#!t[/b] is a spot on and thematic Hardship.
:colonist: [b]Max &amp; John Goldman, Catfish Hunters[/b] are a nice pair of workers you can keep until they get rich enough to retire.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 6.25

For this one specifically:
:colonist: [b]Spectral[/b] Equipment mysteriously processes dirt neglected at its first stage (particularly nice with the Wash Plant). Work it, ghosts!
:colonist: [b]Spectral Vortex[/b] Claim receives the next three tiles that get processed, which can lead to some interesting player interaction….
:colonist: [b]Bodahi[/b] lets you manipulate the Hardship Deck, but (to my tastes) in an ineffective way. I doubt I&#039;d ever buy this.
:colonist: [b]Poltergeist[/b] is a silly but thematic Hardship. In practice, it does the same thing as [i]I&#039;m Too Old for This S#!t[/i], which is a little disappointing.  I&#039;d think a possession that lets another player assign that worker before any of your others are assigned would be much better.  Work around that meeple&#039;s random behavior.
:colonist: [b]Ray &amp; Peter Spengler, Ecto-Managers[/b] — how can you not like the nod?  Well, Winston Zeddemore&#039;s absence in the reference, I guess, but he did join the squad later — [b]anyway[/b], it provides 2 workers with a challenging tradeoff.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 6.25

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I feared that these silly mini-expansions suggested that the game was too silly, but now that I see them in action, it&#039;s clear that they are minor (ha!) little odd effects that are so trivial, that I include them on people&#039;s first play.  I just make sure they are not in the first set of auction lots.  The hardship cards are all self-explanatory, so no problem there.  I actually like what they add to the game!

For this one specifically:
:colonist: [b]Last Frontier[/b] Equipment is too high-tech for tinkering workers to fix it; you need to strip other equipment or use alternate repair techniques.  Nice!  …and it&#039;s all 1-stage, with cheap minimum bid, so it&#039;s very tempting.
:colonist: [b]Maxwell&#039;s Mine[/b] Eh, it&#039;s a rich/rich/promising mine.  Who wouldn&#039;t want that?
:colonist: [b]Holographic Decoy[/b] lets you dodge precisely one Hardship.  It&#039;s a cheap insurance policy, if you ask me!
:colonist: [b]Raided![/b] can be a harsh Hardship, but it lets you choose from Gear, Personnel, [b]and[/b] Equipment, so it&#039;s not horrific.
:colonist: [b]Ruskie Maxwell, Colonist[/b] lets you fix that high-tech Last Frontier equipment, so he&#039;s pretty awesome….</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 6.25

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Immortal Eyes Games brings us a quick, intense mind game.  The cards are of a thickness halfway between cards and tiles, and the cards, board, instructions, and box all sport gorgeous artwork.  As the box claims, this game is an excellent &quot;warm-up&quot; game, and is perfect for those relatively short stints in which you want to play something quick, but suspenseful and satisfying.

For the length of the game (really short), and setup time (the time it takes to unfold the board, provided you keep the players&#039; cards separate), this is a great game to grab to fill a few minutes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Very light, but suspenseful game.  Most of the suspense derives from choosing when and how to break up strong sets:  Keeping a strong set means that if you can grab the lead, you can probably hose people and hold on to it for a bit.  On the other hand, failing to get the lead will mean you are stuck with the large number of tiles that compose that set.  So, perhaps taking nibbles out of it destroys it, but nets you a better score overall.  Not a bad little game, but I don&#039;t think it is worth paying big money to import it from Korea*, unless you&#039;re blind.  That said, I played it with some people at a deaf event (Don&#039;t ask me why I was playing a blind-friendly game at a deaf event :) ), and at least one person was very specifically interested in getting a copy.  So, it&#039;s probably a very kin-friendly game.

The cool, wavy, orange tiles are definitely a selling point of the game, but all you need to try it out is a set of 64 cards of one suit (suits wouldn&#039;t be bad, but they&#039;d add confusion), as follows:
4× 1-15
4× X
Ideally, the X cards should be a different color or something, so they stand out, and one of the 1s should be marked differently so it can identify the start player.

[size=7]* Especially because the box has a LOT of air in it.  I was able to dump the tiles haphazardly into a small tissue box, which is probably 1/6 the volume of the big, orange Peeper box.[/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>First impression.  There are some unusual mechanisms in here, but they can be simply brutal.  Of course, since you&#039;re gambling, it&#039;s technically under your control, and the mechanisms are mostly self-compensating.  The unfortunate part is that you still get some pretty big luck-of-the-draw swing in points.  I suspect this is all mitigated with experience, though, and I look forward to playing this some more.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 6.87

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is a fascinating game of vying for victory points in three simple ways:
1. Having cubes in the six cities - and those cubes can be stripped out in numerous ways, not the least of which is by...
2. Winning elections in a city, securing you right to a number of victory points that could decrease as low as 0 by game end (round 3 at the latest)
3. Winning battles.

The last can be a painful one:  Although there is a nice scaling mechanism to push the odds in the favor of the right party, based on troop strength, your battles still come down to a few die rolls.  If you effectively implement the strategy &quot;roll well&quot;, then you probably can&#039;t lose.

I had no idea what to expect out of this, but now that I know what it&#039;s all about, it&#039;s surprisingly good; however, that may have been biased by the excellent company in which I played it.  There are very interesting mechanisms at work in this game.  If the concept of dice for combat resolution doesn&#039;t bother you at all, then this is an excellent game.</comment>	<conditiontext>New in shrink

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Super-quick, and delightfully suspenseful.  I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll ever find a better Ghostbusters: The Board Game than this.  It&#039;s a family-friendly, gamer-friendly deduction game, and really novel.  Plus, it comes with some additional [gorgeous] components to allow you to play in ways more satisfying for gamers.

[b]Note:[/b] You know how the die-punch process leaves one side flat and the other side curved?  …and usually the flat site sits on the table?  That&#039;s how the board will sit on the table.  …but always have everyone put the ghosts in [b]curved-side-down[/b].  …and whenever someone wants to move or remove a ghost, [b]push the ghost through the board [u]from the top[/u][/b], so it pops out the bottom of the board (you have to lift the board a little to do this).  That way, you&#039;re always pushing curve against curve, and it keeps the edges nice.</comment>				</item>

With the five-card hand of drawn cards, you don&#039;t have much control over your fate, as you watch one yard build and build, then people scarf up the corn with their birds, and you can&#039;t even so much as send a fox in. I think a variant to add some control would make this an interesting game of feints and bluffs. As is, a decent diversion at best.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is a truly interesting picture-search game.  Starting the turn with a roll of the die is rarely a good sign, but in this case, it is.  The three equally likely outcomes are green, &quot;blue&quot;, and red.

Green means that you and only you have to find 1-6 (roll a die) objects matching the description (e.g. things that are cold) in the very short time limit.

&quot;Blue&quot; means that everyone races to spot the picture shown on the card first.

Red fascinatingly starts an auction in complete ignorance.  You bid on how many don&#039;t-yet-knows you think you&#039;ll be able to find.  Once there is a high bidder, the description is revealed, and I have to say that the range of numbers of them you can find is quite varied, which lends a lot of suspense to the bidding.

Finally, as in [thing=24082][/thing], the backs of some cards indicate action upon their being drawn.  In this case, the actions are things that alter the layout of the nine tiles, in order to confuse those of us with photographic memory.  Great idea!

After our first game, ¾ of us had the same thought:  The red auctions have no consequence, so there&#039;s no incentive to stop bidding; however, we subsequently played that failing to succeed at finding the number of objects you bid causes you to lose a precious card (you need six cards to win).  This had two noticeable effects:  It kept our bids much lower, in general, but despite this, it still lengthened the game due to failures to meet our bids.  I think I preferred the faster pace of the first game, but either way is fine, and it&#039;s easy enough for the players to agree beforehand....</comment>				</item>

There is an odd thrill in running from a bigger ship, while tailing a smaller one that&#039;s running from you.  Even more thrill when it&#039;s several larger ships on your tail!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>piecepack</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a basic roll-and-move with some slightly interesting strategic and tactical decisions to make - probably excellent for the target age group.  You occasionally get to decide to change the pose of one of your penguins, and the die roll is only applicable for a penguin in the right pose; therefore, you tend to want to keep at least one penguin waddling, and at least one sliding.  The game is also designed to speed the penguins to the end and back again, so I don&#039;t think too much patience is required of the little players.

Also, the components are superb!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The downtime in this game is useless, because you can do and plan nothing until you roll the die at the beginning of your turn.  Then you have some choices; however, unless one of the choices is a winning move, the options are usually fairly arbitrary, because you have no idea what moves subsequent rolls will require you to make.  As a result, it can be a &quot;one step forward, eight steps sideways&quot; kind of game.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Imagine RoboRally on smaller, tighter boards, with a smaller variety of board elements to hose you.  Now replace the huge deck of uncooperative cards with uncooperative dice.  Instead of firing forward at the end of each phase, you only fire — broadsides — at the end of each entire turn.  Throw in a goodly number of variants, and you have a more family-friendly way to scratch that RoboRally itch; however, vindictive use of the skullduggery faces of the dice can lead to a little frustration.  If you take it in stride, though, it&#039;s all part of the crazy, dangerous fun!</comment>	<conditiontext>Has 5th Player expansion</conditiontext>			<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 4.00

This is an insidious little game with the unfortunate mechanism that you lose all your progress any time you remember incorrectly.  This can be frustrating at any age, but more importantly, it means the game can last forever.  Especially if you&#039;re playing with little ones, I suggest both of the following simple variants:
:colonist: Pete only takes 1 gem back, rather than all of them.  The player acting as Pete gets to choose where it goes.
:colonist: You may move onto your ship to drop off gems you&#039;ve collected so far, but you must do so by opening only one side of the chest, lest Pete hear all that noise and come running!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 6.00

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I love the production quality of the game — a consistent theme with [company=8405][/company].  At first, this can feel like an exercise of rock-paper-scissors, but once you catch on to how to slice correctly (and your opponents &quot;cooperate&quot; — i.e. you predict their optimal moves), you can come back from one solitary garlic to winning the game.

I have one big, two-pronged complaint, though, about this elegant and marvelously produced game:  The rulebook has a safety rule in order to prevent effective player elimination; however, it is perfectly ambiguous.  No problem!  We have a quotation on BGG from one of the designers, in which he gives a better explanation of the safety rule… which is still perfectly ambiguous, just in a different way.  What I&#039;ve found to be the most playable safety rule is [article=10417594]Chris James&#039; simple, unambiguous suggestion[/article]: If a player is in a position to lose all of his toppings [at once], they are all safe.

All in all, this is a deliciously unusual, quick, suspenseful game for precisely three players.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 5.75

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I adore that this game can be won by two very different methods, requiring you to really pay attention to your opponent&#039;s state.  Also, the tactics that won you the last game probably alerted your opponent to something new to watch for, which keeps this game very fluid.  It is a fast-paced, surprising tactical game.  Jim Albea can&#039;t be congratulated enough for working and testing this game for so many years before actually producing it.  Completely brilliant.  The Albeas were also very friendly during our purchase, and for that, deserve all the more support.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>From a game mechanisms standpoint, it&#039;s pretty bad, but it does give the players choices, and lets you run along collecting Pokémon….  It [b]is[/b] better than I expected.

Where they really missed an opportunity here is that all the Pokémon skills are reduced to a simple battle point scale.  So, if I have a 9, three 8s, a 6, and a 4, it is strictly better to use the 9 in battle.  The only catch is that whoever you send into the ring is at risk of being lost.  …but guess what?  The 9 has the least chance of being lost, because it&#039;s better.  Even if they&#039;d given the li&#039;l beasties a rock-paper-scissors designation, so a &quot;rock&quot; has an advantage fighting a &quot;paper&quot;, there would have been something to weigh in that choice.  Instead, you have a deck of a million Pokémon, when a deck of, say, twenty would have been the same.  Oh well.  At least you can rocket through the game, and kids like seeing all the different pictures for what, in this game, are functionally identical creatures.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>These provide some zany, but fun optional acquisitions to Power Grid.  I really wish there were an icon marking the &quot;plant&quot; cards that are immediately auctioned to all when they are drawn, though.

Also, as a huge bonus, the way most of them work is sufficiently non-disruptive to the flow of the game, so you can jam wads of them in the deck without people having to bear extra rules in mind.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>First impression:  We may have had a particularly stupid robot for our first go, but it seemed too easy to manipulate it to an ineffective state.  Thus, although it provided fun dynamics to the market and the board, it was not any competition at all.  At game end, the robot had merely 6 cities connected.  Nonetheless, the variety imposed upon the map and the market shook things up nicely, and I look forward to taking The Robots out for another dance.

Also, [b]every[/b] modern classic needs this type of expansion.  [i]What&#039;s that?  You need to drop out?  No problem; we&#039;ll build a robot to sit in for you.[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 7.50

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Ppolf is a very nice tabletop disc golf simulation.  If you enjoy flicking/carom games, you&#039;re probably going to like this one.  Don&#039;t get cocky and set up a bunch of obstacles for your first course; in fact, zero is plenty.  The &quot;baskets&quot; (tiles) themselves provide more than enough obstacles.

One minor gripe is that hard flicks will knock the baskets around, but the rules cover that scenario.  Still, it feels wrong to alter the course for the next person.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>What a nice, intricate game, with [b]plenty[/b] of interaction between the cards you can get into play!  I strongly recommend forcing your players to use the little chits that indicate how much PR, Quality, and/or Trendiness they have, going into the show.  The competition is a bit unfair if people have to ask all the time, and it slows the game down.  Nonetheless, there are a ton of moving parts in the game, but few actions with few workers, which is a delight.  One unfortunate part is that you do have to do a bit of gambling when placing your workers, and just one bad gamble wastes 33% of a round&#039;s actions.  When you have only 24 actions in the game, that&#039;s a lot.  A number of aspects of this game remind me of [thing=42052][/thing], but the gambles in that game are fewer — by which I mean that it&#039;s basically only vying for the endgame that involves placing workers (barrels, in that case) that might end up being useless.  It does sting in Vinhos, too, though.  The difference is that you probably had chances to use them for other purposes before then.  [shrug]  I look forward to playing Prêt-à-Porter more.  I dig a game in which you can waste 50% of the game in a huge deficit, but come back to second place… even if it is only a little over half of first place.  :gulp:</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.73

The insidious mechanism of a checkbook with nine checks whose values increase as your collection does &amp;#8212; and of course, how can you afford to collect, other than clever bartering and spending the aforementioned checks? &amp;#8212; provides for a pleasant agony in deciding the course of your actions.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I was surprised to discover how different this feels from [thing=12][/thing].  Yes, the core auction mechanism is absolutely identical, but the tiles are 100% different (except for the Ra tiles, of course), and there is nothing similar with [thing=12][/thing] about the way you collect them or score them.  Additionally, buildings and people are mostly two-sided, allowing you to choose which type you are putting on the auction block when you draw it.  This is a factor in your decisions, but it doesn&#039;t weigh as heavily on the game as I might have expected.  An example of a big difference is that rather than having disasters that instantaneously and immediately destroy tiles, you have plagues that are (triangularly) cumulative badness, and are hard to eradicate.  This is a worthy purchase alongside [thing=12][/thing], although I&#039;d have preferred to have an option to buy only the new tiles and ankhs.</comment>				</item>

[b]Sacred Hill, level 1[/b]: ([b][bgcolor=#9999ff]&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b]) Wei-Qi-like strategic game.
[b]Sacred Hill, level 2[/b]: ([b][bgcolor=#ffffff]&amp;nbsp;?&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b]) TBP
[b]High Kings of Tara, level 1[/b]: ([b][bgcolor=#ffffff]&amp;nbsp;?&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b]) TBP
[b]High Kings of Tara, level 2[/b]: ([b][bgcolor=#ffffff]&amp;nbsp;?&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b]) TBP
[b]Poisoned Chalice[/b]: TBP ([b][bgcolor=#ffffff]&amp;nbsp;?&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b]) TBP

I love the bits.  This is how beginners&#039; Go/Wei-Qi should be made:  It facilitates seeing which stones are connected.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Prototype: This is an excellent word game, with nice tradeoffs and a fast, intense pace.  Interrupting another player&#039;s turn is encouraged, yet doing it excessively is punished.  The at-will one-minute timer is perfect for the game, and helps keep the pace up.
This game is a piece of excellence.  I look forward to being able to purchase it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A tricky game of obscuring your &quot;bricks&quot; while providing only nastily exposed places for your opponents to build.  The solid &quot;bricks&quot; are very satisfying to handle, and though the contemplations each player makes on where to place their bricks sometimes slow the game a little much, it still moves sufficiently quickly and viciously to keep me engaged.</comment>				</item>

The rotation of roles, and little things you may try doing in order to squeak ahead really leave you itching to try it again!  Yes, the game takes its two hours, but since you&#039;re active pretty much the whole time, the hours just whiz by!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Pulling Strings restores face to simultaneous action declaration.  Temporarily helping your opponent at just the right moment can really screw him up in the long run, by removing his ability to yank chips toward that particular spot any more.  Of course, you can&#039;t either, but you really don&#039;t mind that:  You helped him once so you could help yourself the rest of the time.  I look forward to playing this more.  Besides, any game that makes good and practical use of ASL is worth a look.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>19</numplays>			<comment>The changes definitely seem to be improvements, as intended.  It&#039;s easy to muddle through this, and casually appreciate some of the self-balancing mechanisms in the game, without it really clicking for you.  Thanks to the ante, the game will end.  There is so much right about this game.  One of the [conceptually] simplest improvements* that [thing=67928][/thing] brings to the genre is having each player play a different character.  It means that you can leave the entire setup identical, except for three character chips per player, and still play a strategically different game every time.

[size=7]* As with software, the simplest change for the user often requires the most work under the hood.  The amount of effort put into design, development, and testing the very asymmetrical characters is probably obscene.[/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[b]2-player[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] As a 2-player game, I have to say that this is a really interesting, lateral thinking game.  The action is fast enough that if you get beaten down, and nothing goes your way, it&#039;s over quickly; however, between the bend-the-rules cards, of which you can accumulate three, and the one-shot gambit cards, not to mention the clever ways you can use the ship dice themselves, it takes more than a bad skirmish to keep a player down.

I suspect that the attacking aspect of the game would make me not enjoy it with more than 2 players, but I&#039;m peculiar that way — and I could be wrong:  I though the rules were interesting, but I certainly didn&#039;t expect to enjoy the game as much as I did (with 2).  I think plenty of people would eat this up, though.

Oh, yeah, and the dice and boards are [b]huge[/b].  I assumed they were standard-size dice, and the boards sized accordingly.

One of the things I love about this game is that it uses [thing=9440]Maharaja[/thing]&#039;s notion that the goal of the game is to get all of your palaces / Quantum Cubes constructed, no matter what other fun distractions there are along the way.  Unlike that favorite, though, this game gives you two ways to do that, one of which is direct conflict.  In a two-player game, I have very little problem with this, and it&#039;s an interesting strategic option!  A notable difference/similarity between Maharaja palaces and Quantum Cubes is that Quantum Cubes also serve as deployment centers (Aspects of this game felt just a little like [thing=35256]Caledea[/thing], with its own odd charm); however, in Maharaja, your objective structures can heavily influence receiving greater income, should the maharaja be enticed to revisit their location.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	10.00

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A blank map tile.  So what?  Let me tell you!  When it provides you a temptation to &quot;waste time&quot; parking your ships out in the void, just to gain a little research, it can be a big deal!  In practice, what this means is that you might swing a ship over into the void, rather than ending its move elsewhere.  It rewards you while taking pressure off the nearby planets.  Sometimes it rewards you for what would otherwise be a junk move.  It&#039;s a good element, no matter how simple it looks!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>36</numplays>			<comment>I love that the replay value is increased by providing various cards for each type of die, so while a Death Incarnation is always a Death Incarnation, its exact efficacy can vary from game to game.  There are very interesting choices to make in this game.  The biggest downside is that players can dither with the dice on their turn, trying to min/max, but if you play with people who are willing to take chances (It [b]is[/b] a bloody dice game, after all!) just to see how it will work out, you should be just fine.  Also, gaining familiarity with the cards and game in general should help.  Otherwise, it plays nice and fast, and more importantly, I keep itching to play it again.

Don&#039;t let the MSRP scare you too badly:  You get 130 custom dice (5 of each special die, with a few extra basic [custom] dice), and several variations of each associated Power Card, as well as a nice dice bag for each player, and scoring cubes that actually match the bags&#039; colors.  The cards are the cheap part, but they lend so, so much more replayability to the game — as if the unpredictable dice themselves didn&#039;t.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>The Quaxos slipstream into the rest easily enough, and all interact with each other especially.  Interestingly, they appear to have been color laser printed on 110 pound or better paper/cardstock, as opposed to the mass market, finished printing technique used for the normal cards.  As a result, the colors [can&#039;t and] don&#039;t quite match the others, but it isn&#039;t really a problem.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A fun, sneaky, jockeying-for-&quot;area&quot;-control game, which is driven by a lot of non-controlling placements on controllable buildings that have been started by those who want to control them.  There are enough cogs moving in this game to make it [pleasantly] difficult to manipulate perfectly, which means there are nearly always sneaky avenues to accomplishing something helpful.  The scoring-with-a-half-life of the &quot;domains&quot; is delightfully unusual (the closest I&#039;ve seen to this is [thing=12188][/thing], which cycles through the areas for tie-breakers, but doesn&#039;t pass along cubes), and manipulating it can be of great importance, but every bit as difficult as manipulating the other mechanisms of the game.

Gameplay is quite fast, considering all that delicious complexity, allowing Québec to deliver an excellent gaming experience in the time advertised on the box — a rare bit of verity!

The entire board is composed of colored spaces for the buildings.  During setup, the buildings are shuffled, and placed on the board randomly by color.  The only differences between the buildings themselves is the era (1–4) during which they are available to be started; their position determines what ability they confer to contributors.  …but the era number is a huge factor in play, because you want to maximize your biggest chain of buildings.  More cleverly and specifically, you want to maximize the point value of your most valuable chain of buildings, so just flitting along for minimal points is extremely ineffective — for chaining purposes, anyway….

A brilliant game, which I look forward to playing more!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.50

Invest in a beast enough to push it into the lead while stowing enough of its stock for yourself to keep you ahead of the competition.  That&#039;s it!  Extremely quick, slippery-bar-of-soap game:  The harder you try to grab what you want, the less grip you have on it.  Of course, the Mythological Edition has very nice NeonDragon art from Jessica Peffer.</comment>				</item>

THE LIVE is not quite as &quot;naughty&quot; as the normal manga-style [thing=24894][/thing]; however, because they&#039;re photos of a real person, it looks like a pinup book.  Nonetheless, this is a playable book, and represents a slightly different incarnation of Airi, with different powers.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>There are plenty of laughs to be had, and plenty of lateral thinking.  The physical stunts put those of The Mad Magazine Game to shame.  Ultimately, though, this is not really my sort of game, and I pretty much would only play it if coerced.  I love that the illustrations for the pawns show their fronts on the fronts, and their backs on the backs.  That&#039;s a nice bit of extra effort!

P.S.  For whatever reason, something like 70% of our turns were red cards, so having red for the final space was just the poison on the cake after all that.  I think the game is probably more fun if you actually get a statistically likely distribution of die rolls.  :^)</comment>				</item>

[b]1p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] — OK, I&#039;m pretty addicted to solitaire right now.

[b]2p[/b] TBD

[b]3p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] — It seems to me that the rogue has the worst chance of winning this.  The mage shouldn&#039;t have any trouble revealing 20 tiles (especially with the inadvertent help of his opponents), and sometimes the warrior will have access to many monsters — or too few.  …but the rogue&#039;s goal guarantees that the mage can neglect 45% of his goal, assuming that he&#039;s not worried about the warrior winning, so I think the rogue may get the short end of the stick.  We&#039;ll see, though!

[b]4p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] — Ah!  Here we are.  Suspenseful, manipulative, but quick.  The balance feels pretty good here.  When the healer won, the warrior (next player in turn order) was one step from winning, and the rogue (next after warrior) was 2 steps from winning.  The mage was 6 steps from winning, but he had gambled on his teleport, choosing between two locations and lost the gamble.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The crazy, crabby graphics of the Gigamic edition sets a frame of mind I prefer for this game:  Quick, silly competition.  This abstract strategy game is fine to play for a quick stint.  I doubt I&#039;d ever dig it out of a closet to play, though, unless I wanted to see thos amusing graphics.  The more classical editions have always looked pretty, but the game - with four, at least - is just a brutal spitefest until people are out of barriers, allowing whoever was least abused to win.</comment>				</item>

Simple, given the nice scoring reference on the gameboard:  Having the most of some things, or multiples of others, or certain combinations of some, or complete sets of still others gains you points, while having none, or the least of certain things, loses you points.  With each bid, you are not only helping to fate your points for the current epoch, but also determining your bid potential for the next epoch, in a cleverly implemented mechanism.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>As the rules and box state, this is basically [thing=11]Bohnanza[/thing] taken in a slightly different direction.  5 of the 7 bean types have magic effects while sitting in your fields, all of which are significant.  1 of the 7 types adds more magic spells to your repertoire when you harvest it.  The 7th type just has a darn nice beanometer for its frequency in the deck:  There are 17 Princess Beans, but they have a beanometer like Soy Beans (12) in [thing=11]Bohnanza[/thing].  It doesn&#039;t sound significant, but it really is, when you can keep harvesting them in pairs to get one bean taler out of every two beans.  The possibly-backfiring attacks, beastly bullying of bean talers, plucking of hand cards, and 11 magic spells really make this a fun and somewhat suspenseful spin on the [thing=11]Bohnanza[/thing] formula.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>This is, as many have said, a more intricate cousin of San Juan.  I&#039;m itching to play it some more, but I currently have some concerns about how opportunistic (namely, luck of the draw) it might be.  Examples:  I mined for cards a lot, and throughout the whole game, drew merely two - yes, two - cards that could provide military.  So, clearly, I couldn&#039;t pursue military.  I drew only two cards that could provide genes, and one of those was exclusively a windfall planet.  I had two shots at alien tech, one at novelty, and enough rare elements cards to do some stuff with them.  In other words, I had constant tough decisions, but I had extremely little choice about what I could pursue.  It seemed that the best strategy was to specialize in something, and cash in on that; however, what if you end up with a smattering of everything?  Remember, I was drawing a good number of cards, thanks in part to my developments - little thanks to my poor production potential.

Nonetheless, I suspect that with experience, you see clearer paths through the chaos.  I yearn for that experience.</comment>	<conditiontext>Autographed</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This game has its roots in Pachisi:  Help all/enough of your pawns traverse the path safely to the goal, in order to win.  What makes this game much more interesting than Pachisi?  The sweeping radars, and the choices in which exact path toward the goal you will try to use.  The radars sweep faster as more planes are on their screen, increasing the likelihood that planes are sent home.  Oh, and except for the lightning spaces in the centers of the six outer radars, planes can&#039;t be captured by other planes.  You work your way toward the center radar screen, which at first sweeps at half the speed of the outer radars; however, since planes must accumulate in the central radar in order to vie for victory, it soon sweeps at incredible speed.  This also serves as a nice catch-up mechanism, because the players close to winning must commit strong dice to keep their planes on the central screen alive.

Unfortunately, ultimately, as with the other members of its family, your success is dependent upon getting lucky rolls.  With all players given equally good/bad rolls, wise tactical choices will be the deciding factor; however, unfortunate rolls will keep you from winning against all but the most foolish players.  Nonetheless, its novelty of movement and back-to-start mechanisms make this a pleasure for me to play.

Suggestion:  The fighters from [gameid=548] are tiny enough to make marvelously fitting planes for [gameid=25070].</comment>	<conditiontext>home-made</conditiontext>			</item>

This game and [thing=19995][/thing] have a fair amount in common.  Unlike Canal Mania, your connections are not driven/constrained by contract cards: You can build links anyplace where the delivery opportunities are ripe, or wherever you bloody well wish.  The loan system is a gentler sum of the schemes used in [thing=28720][/thing] and [thing=39683][/thing]:  You can&#039;t pay back &quot;loans&quot;, they permanently detract from your income, and they reduce your score at the end of the game.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.7+:	 8.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting spin on connection games (e.g. rail or power), with some unusual mechanisms I&#039;d like to explore more.  Unfortunately, there as a lot more information to look at in any given moment than is practical.  The business cards have nice illustrations of the business in question occupying much of the upper half.  Much more useful would have been to have a minimap that shows where the heck the town or city is.  The industry illustration could still be on the card as a washed out background, or a smaller icon.

The health of the economy is controlled by a die roll, but you lucky dogs see it coming two turns in advance, which mitigates its effects greatly.</comment>				</item>

[b]Advanced[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6.5 [/bgcolor][/b] It sounds like a more user-friendly version of [thing=43307][/thing], which is an excellent game; however, the rules leave a number of things unclear.  Although the play of the basic game is more streamlined and pleasant, there are things in the advanced game I&#039;d like to explore some more before it&#039;s totally relegated to the mothballs.  I do rather like that the advanced game equipment should work for pretty much any [thing=38479]RotW[/thing] map.  With tighter rules, I&#039;d probably enjoy it more, and want to pursue it more.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.50

Loads of lateral thinking have been added to the game, as you try to plan transport of cubes through various times, without revisiting an era.  Plus, with 8 boards, and only using 3–7 per game (2–6 players), there is plenty of variety to be had.  So cool!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.00

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I really enjoyed playing this when I received it as a gift in grade school.  The art and the different-valued house parts (and their colors) kept me coming back for more.  I&#039;ve played it in the last few years, as well, but my opponent just got nowhere.  Therefore, it wasn&#039;t a fair opportunity to rate it:  Playing against a flounder just isn&#039;t much fun.  On the other hand, after each slaughter, he would insist on just one more game, so clearly it has some allure.

Thus, I give a tentative rating, subject to change upon playing a proper game of it!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The &quot;eggs&quot; have very nice magnetic fields, but this dexterity game is pretty much decided by the first person to have to pick eggs up.  It&#039;s suspenseful, but challenges the players too little.  Because Polarity requires the players to lean magnets on others&#039; magnetic fields, having played that, RattleSnake feels trivial.  On the other hand, it&#039;s very fun to just play with the magnets....</comment>	<conditiontext>one of the eggs is cracked, but seems to function just fine - and there&#039;s never been any sign of a rattlesnake emerging from it....</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>If you only had the base game, this triples the number of class cards available, which greatly increases the replay value.  Instead of each game having 6 of the 6, it has 6 of the 18 (or more, with other expansions).  The protective classes (Nun, Bishop, Wizard, Emperor) are an interesting new dynamic.  Queen and mayor are riskier roles to take, but can be very rewarding.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 7.50

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Very intense game of trickily interlocking mechanisms.  For your first game or so, you might do well to try it on SpielByWeb, since it constantly shortlists your options to suit the circumstances.  That being said, this is a grueling, but interesting third-party struggle for dominance.  You make the coral grow, possibly consuming other coral over which it has dominance, and claim a coral territory as your own by guarding it with one of your shrimp.  You can manipulate the relative dominance of any pair of coral types, but you must choose the moment when it is most beneficial for you to have your parrotfish eat one of your shrimp and the coral it guards, thus earning yourself VP.  Ah, but the relative strengths of the coral types also determines their values in VP at the end.  Very good stuff, but not something you can casually whip out, teach to someone new, and expect them to offer you any competition.

If the rating simply reflected its brilliance, this game would be rather close to a [b][bgcolor=#00cc00]&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Wow.  This game uses cards for movement, and lets the players choose how they&#039;ll move and manipulate the paths to the goal.  It also wisely makes the player-hosing spells once-only, so they deplete, and the game can end.  Somehow, it still feels pointless and thoroughly un-fun.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 3.50

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I love the production on this game, and it sounds like an enticing notion, especially with the actions being mandatory, but in any order; but I felt like I had nearly no control over what was going on. Two consecutive games ended 5-0 for the same player, so effectively, it was 10-0. I really hope I&#039;ve missed something crucial in the succinct rules (besides mistaken the use of &quot;effect&quot; instead of &quot;affect&quot;, which I did not miss ;)), because they really hit it out of the park on graphics and packaging, and I&#039;d like to show it off, not hide it.</comment>				</item>

So, half-way through the game, poles accelerate you, and ladders send you back.  Also clever is that there&#039;s no regression past the half-way point, so once you get over to the &quot;back&quot; of the board, you have at least guaranteed making it that far.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Simple, suspenseful die-rolling.  Making your initial roll, and then committing to a territory provides very interesting choices.  It&#039;s all luck of the roll beyond that choice - well, choosing which dice to commit to the card is technically a choice, but it&#039;s fairly perspicuous which you should choose from a statistical standpoint.  Simple and suspenseful.  For those who are itching to try this, but dismayed that it&#039;s not in your country, download the 7dice file from the file section.  :^)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s an interesting take on the engine-building dice game concept.  Simply building one&#039;s engine is not enough, because another player can jam on the points successfully with a lesser engine; however, too weak an engine and you get nowhere.  Of course, as with most dice games, the key to winning is rolling well and making some good guesses along the way.</comment>				</item>

Unfortunately, they opted to have a 10% chance that you don&#039;t move: 5% that you change the board, but don&#039;t move; 5% that you just lose your turn.  I am ever against &quot;lose a turn&quot; mechanisms, and recommend house ruling that as you and your opponents see fit.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Pleasant, cutthroat positioning game.  This definitely would be better with solid pieces, rather than the hollow plastic of the [company=765][/company] version.  Really, they couldn&#039;t have playtested it with the final components.  The lazy-susan is concave, which causes severe instability once stacks are higher than four cubes high.  Even if you shim it to flatten and stabilize it, the hollow plastic pieces knock each other about, really damaging the game experience.  The solid pieces of [gameid=3228] permit stacking, but [gameid=6411]&#039;s do not.  Most unfortunate.  The game design is quite fine, though!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>36</numplays>			<comment>I can&#039;t get enough of this game.  The careful management of your funds; the ability to completely shoot yourself in the foot, but only have to suffer for the short duration of the game before trying again, because you usually know what you did wrong.  Yet it&#039;s so easy to be tempted to err again.  This game is brilliant!  For the longest time, I&#039;d only played it on BrettSpielWelt, and feared that keeping track of everyone&#039;s income and all that could be an accounting nightmare which could really detract from the fun.  In reality, the biggest thing missing is the cool snippets of Russian music to prompt the players.  :^)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The plexiglass pieces are the best bits I&#039;ve ever experienced in a game.  The modular map of Japan, which merely omits an island for each player fewer, is simply brilliantly designed.  This is a fairly fast and sneaky game of influence and control.  Some people who play this seem to actively hate the scoring system&#039;s assertion that if two people tie for a lead, they are both worthless.  I love that mechanism:  It means you not only have to strive for a lead, but must be very attentive to attaining it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>With three players, anyway, this game was kind of relaxing for having two once-around auctions per turn.  I enjoy it.  Its manual, however, makes the game sound way more complex than it is, even though it&#039;s a fairly succinct manual.  This is certainly a game you can pick up by watching a turn or two, and being told the very simple end-game scoring.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>These dominoes are squarely in the category of &quot;I wish the game had a tile like [i]X[/i];&quot; however, in practice, they aren&#039;t particularly desirable. They can be useful, they can enable you to score a border space, but they don&#039;t set you up for another play, so it can be a bit like skipping half of a turn. Still, they have their uses, even if nobody took one for an entire game.

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>Very quick, simple, and entertaining.  It&#039;s the excitement of watching a dexterity game, with the active gameplay of a simple strategic game.  You place your orbs in discrete locations, and you don&#039;t have the Bausack / Arbos / et cetera factor of everything falling apart when you mess up - instead, you just retrieve your sphere, and your turn is done.  The rules are quite simple, but the interdependent fulcra of the rings provide some delicious surprises, as you place your innocent little 1-point sphere on a ring, and watch the balance shift in a way you didn&#039;t quite expect.  This game is unanimously beautiful to see in still; however, its greater beauty is the motion on three interdependent axes that influence each other more with each placement.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Awesome dexterity game system.  The turtle in this and the turtles in [gameid=18881] are superb!

Game 1: [b]From Island to Island[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#9999ff]&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] It&#039;s Go Fish with a dexterity prerequisite.  Get the turtle to an island, and you can ask players for that animal tile.  It&#039;s fun and challenging to get the turtle where you need it, but it slows down the Fishing process; however, you only need two cards more than those with which you started in order to win.  So, ultimately, it&#039;s pretty fast.

Game 2: [b]Turtle Skittles[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#66ff99]&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] This is twisted.  It&#039;s bowling / skittles, but you use the turtle to knock down the 9-pin setup.  Ah, but really makes this a sick little game is that you score [thing=2243][/thing]-style:  You&#039;re trying to bowl every score once.  Each time you roll a duplicate, you must choose a score where you will take a zero!

Game 3: [b]Turtle-Boules[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#66ff99]&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] This time, you use the turtle as a cue ball in a game of Bocce / Boules / Petanque.  This one&#039;s only for two players, but using the turtle to position glass pebbles (and/or the target) is a nice challenge.

Game 4: [b]Turtle Memory[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#9999ff]&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] As with From Island to Island, it&#039;s sort of [thing=7688][/thing] with a dexterity prerequisite.  Get the turtle to an island, then flip the tile that matches the animal there.  This one definitely gives the advantage to the dexterous player with workable memory.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Try all the modes!</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>In common with Lost Cities, Schotten Totten torments the two players by usually requiring them to commit to battles (or expeditions in the case of Lost Cities) before they&#039;re ready to.  In ways, it&#039;s more agonizing in Schotten Totten, because players are in direct competition to do better than each other at each of the nine stones.  Since the game can be won not only by force, winning the majority of the battles for stones, but also strategically, by winning three adjacent stones&#039; battles, the decision of how to play your nine parallel 3-card poker hands gets still more interesting as you attempt to lure your opponent&#039;s strong formations away from the three adjacent stones you&#039;d like to take - while you can&#039;t know what troops you&#039;ll drum up to send in, other than the ones already before you in your hand.  In summation, quick fun, with tricky speculation every turn.  This is a two-player game that is always fun to play.</comment>				</item>

As for [b]the English version[/b]:
Good fun to be had here, but since the landscape upon which you can build a word changes right up until your turn, each player provides a lot of downtime as she tries to place a word in the new environment. I prefer a more &quot;active&quot; game, but this is certainly enjoyable on occasion. Wildwords spices things up with the Scrabble formula, but I prefer Upwords for a crossword game. Since it allows you to cover old tiles, the board landscape is far less dictatorial.</comment>				</item>

The execution is simple enough, and actually fairly fun.  By the time you mow through 50 states, however, it starts to get old.  The &quot;Go the Distance&quot; cards mix up the tasks a little bit, but aside from the geographical educational value, I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s a good thing in this case.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s an interesting game, but with so much text, and so absolutely nothing to do when it&#039;s not your turn, besides taking the 13 seconds required to decide what to do when your turn rolls around, it just drags, while your opponents cycle through all the stuff they&#039;re doing on their turns.  Fantastic art and components, though!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.80

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Definitely a lot more fun than the photos led me to believe.  Though you are at the mercy of the tiles drawn, there are still some interesting strategies you can use, and every play is a gamble.  You&#039;re either playing for some points, betting that you won&#039;t lose them in a temblor, or trying to attract the next shockwave to rip through your opponents&#039; points, betting that there are still more quakes to come.

The downer is that, at the end of the game, it&#039;s very likely that only one or even zero of your dudes score.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Yawn.  There are strategic choices to make, but they&#039;re pretty obvious, even for kids.  On the upside, you generally can win the game within 5 turns, and even if you try to do your worst, someone is likely to win within 15 minutes.  So, it&#039;s over quickly enough.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Quite an odd drafting game. It has a fair amount of pick-a-player-and-do-this-thing-to-them, of which I am not a fan, but it also had some interesting aspects. Unfortunately, the variety of cards, combined with the complexity of the requirements to build ships (which thankfully is not the only way to score points), combined with the frequent opponent tear-down makes it frustratingly difficult to progress. Fortunately, there are safer ways to earn points… if those cards ever come around to you.

The art is very appealing, and there are worthwhile aspects to the game, but overall, it is not for me.</comment>				</item>

The five rondels (four accessed through one) provide for some very interesting choices, but make the game very incompatible for someone with a fixed strategy, unable to roll with the opportunities as they come.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Dropping in pieces you captured from your opponent as your own provides some fascinating scenarios and challenges.  It also means losing a key piece is doubly dangerous.  The ability for nearly every piece to promote, though usually to a piece that can only move one space, is also key to making this a very fun chess to play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Rather torturous (in a pleasant way), as you utilize each of your ten actions in no more than one province per season.  The order in which those actions fire has quite a large impact on your choices as well.  Very interesting!  The turn order mechanism is a nice touch over Wallenstein; however, you might need to take a horrid ability in order to get the turn order you need, or vice versa.</comment>				</item>

Similar themes, similar assembly of a film.  The genre implementation in Showbiz Shuffle is a nice thing HB doesn&#039;t have.  HB, on the other hand, has the auctioned lots.  Thematically, they scratch the same itch.  Mechanically, it depends on what you&#039;re in the mood for!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>My first impression was that I appreciated but didn&#039;t like the choose-the-next-player mechanism.  After a little reflection, it&#039;s more balanced than I initially thought; however, the last player to get an action (as opposed to the person who gets no action) is the one most likely to get &quot;screwed&quot;, so if you&#039;re always that person, you might feel downtrodden.  On the other hand, you can vie to start the very next turn, which at least will get you more money, which is worth about as many points as the cubes anyway.  My respect for that mechanism rises still more even as I type!</comment>				</item>

One of my favorite parts of this game is something not necessarily evident until you&#039;ve played it a few times:  You usually can easily recover from someone obstructing your intended path - sometimes for an even shorter path than you&#039;d planned.  ...but this also means you can feint and block, placing ants, or even a hill or two where they cause others problems, or don&#039;t make it so perspicuous how close you are to winning, sometimes allowing you to reach victory unchallenged.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a finite and hence minimal-downtime push-your-luck game with very nice dice.  This plays well as a solitaire — in fact, there&#039;s not a whole lot of reason (beyond social ones) to play it with others, except that it adds the dynamic of the Abandoned materials.  On your turn, you get either 3 dice (of your choice) or all the abandoned dice, and roll them, building, demolishing, or (with more than one player) abandoning one or more after each roll.  Gambling hard and/or (more likely) poor rolls can lead to a lot of frustrating recidivation, but this is a pretty pure dice game.  Your choices are simple (but interesting), so turns go quickly, and the game goes quickly.  After a bad game, you can shelve it, or spend another 15 minutes or so trying it again.

Bonus:  The solitaire rules not only give you point-based rankings, but also provide goals you can try to achieve, just to make the game more interesting in this world of achievements in video games, which push you to replay numerous times, trying very strange things, and really experiencing the game more fully.  I wish more boardgames had this aspect.  [i](My extreme enjoyment of [thing=25554][/thing] is ongoing, because it&#039;s pretty easy to create goals like that for yourself in the game, but less easy to find satisfaction with them while contending with the draft choices and other leftovers from your opponents, as well as the whim of the rats/characters.)[/i]</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 6.38

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The two-stage, combo-driven play in this game takes some basic abstract strategy concepts, and stirs them together, but with a suspenseful edge to it all.  I really like this.

Connect opposite sides of the map, eliminate 10 enemy agents, run your opponent out of agents, capture an agent with your militia, or get five of your scientists in a line to win.  It sounds disjointed and messed up, but the two-stage deployment/activation of agents (deployment as sleepers, activation as whatever-crazy-power) really makes it work, and the multiple, weird victory conditions keep you on your toes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>39</numplays>			<comment>As with [thing=60]Vinci[/thing], there is a lot of downtime, especially with new players, but otherwise a game of subtle strategy and puzzle-solving, really.  Warring is represented, but less as conflict, and more as a predictable occurrence.  You can conquer all day long and not win.  The key is in maximizing your &quot;income&quot; with both your live civilization and your declining one.  The feel is almost identical to [thing=60]Vinci[/thing]; however, having different boards for the different numbers of players can only be an improvement.

The mix-and-match of peoples and powers provides some nice variability and replay value.  It also makes it very easy to expand, as [company=1027][/company] and numerous BGG users have deftly demonstrated.

I&#039;m not thrilled about adding the relics for this, because the rules-exceptions-to-uses-in-play ratio for relics is way higher than for the races and powers, but it&#039;s easy enough to agree whether to include them.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m really glad they classified these by chaos level.  Nearly all of the non-wimpy ones are only for when you feel like having the game flow outright dictated by the cards (e.g. active races don&#039;t score this turn, or in-decline races don&#039;t score this turn).  These can provide some fun variety and tide to the game, but like the [thing=38733][/thing], it&#039;s only for when you are in a mood for less control over the game.</comment>				</item>

Oh, and the instructions are incredibly difficult to digest, partially because of nearly every noun having &quot;Smart&quot; in it.  Nonetheless, there are interesting mechanisms in here, though, so I&#039;ve mostly rewritten the instructions to remove as much of the &quot;smart&quot;-ness as I could (which is nearly every use of the word).  I&#039;m also going to try using acrylic nuggets and cups to replace the candies and shells.  Then someone bigger than an action figure could pick the things up!  ...and slight humidity won&#039;t cause the components to stick to the table.
Thus, I have given a tentative rating of the game design, because I think we&#039;ve got a pretty good game here....</comment>	<conditiontext>Like new

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Very cool racing game that suffers from pretty heavy downtime.  It grants the player both more and less control than [gameid=173]:  More control in that you apply cards from your hand to control the sled, rather than rolling a die.  In other words, when you make a decision, you pretty much know how it&#039;s going to play out.  Less control in that you can&#039;t steer willy nilly, so your choices must be much more predictive and strategic.</comment>				</item>

The best addition may be that while you have two or more aces [u]in your layout[/u] (not in the foundation), you may move queens and jacks to blank stacks just like you normally can with kings.  As a result, this is significantly more strategic and fun than Klondike, without losing any of the addictiveness.

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>This game is a great example of American ingenuity and cheapness being combined excellently.  Sorry! Sliders gives you shuffleboard, [thing=5072][/thing], [thing=521][/thing], darts, bocce, and even some [thing=150][/thing] pleasures, and I got it new for $15.  It&#039;s made with cheap components — &lt; 2mm thick cardboard, plastic pawns, plastic rails, plastic pawns with ball bearings — but it&#039;s done in a clever, effective way, permits playfield construction, and the translucent pawns actually look pretty cool.  Graphic design on the cardboard has a nice, multi-layered digital art style (sort of like a simplified spin on [url=http://wirestyle.deviantart.com/]wirestyle[/url]&#039;s technique) that pairs well with the translucent pawns.  The vivacious colors and graphical style deftly misdirect your attention from how very far from a [company=1562][/company] production this is.

The differences between the following games barely qualify as variants, so I won&#039;t say much about them as separate concepts.  Due to the short length of the score tracks, games are typically very fast, leaving you hungry for another go.  Additionally, þe olde American standard mechanism of &quot;You must reach the goal by exact count,&quot; that usually serves only to lengthen a game with a shoddy attempt to hinder the leader, in this case provides some darts-like constraints:  &quot;Oh, I need three ones and a two now.  Anything three or higher is useless to me.&quot;  It works well.

The configurability of the layout picks up a smidgen of [thing=150][/thing]ness.  It&#039;s not like you even have curves at your disposal, but that any configurability whatsoever is present is astounding.

[b]Race for Home[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] [thing=5072][/thing]y/shuffleboardy goodness!

[b]Instant Home[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] This gets a little [thing=521][/thing] feel, having the insta-home hole in the middle.  The game goes even faster.

[b]Instant Sorry![/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] Having an extra way — smack in the middle of the target — to send yourself and others back to Start is not such a good thing, even if it is pretty much the trademark mechanism of [thing=2407][/thing]; however, the inner ring of the bullseye is upgraded to a from a 4-point to a 4-5-6-point space, which nearly compensates for it.  With consistent players, this game is fine, but with kids or other erratic players, it can be frustrating to watch them kill themselves turn after turn.

[b]Danger Dots[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] I like that the dots merely &quot;explode&quot;, sending your piece off for no score.  It&#039;s a stingless Sorry! shot, basically.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.7+:	 7.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A fun, amusing game of deliveries (It strangely reminded me slightly of Game of the States), in which the dice simply resolve the known risks:  If you take risky cargo, you know the odds of losing your ship.  Of course, since you can buy insurance, the risks are less catastrophic, if you&#039;ve chosen to take the insurance.  However, when you miss winning by less than the price of your unused insurance policy, &quot;Regret&quot; will be your new middle name.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>When I rated it [b][bgcolor=#66ff99]&amp;nbsp;8.1&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b], I said: Excellently speedy game.  The fact that you&#039;re handed your next turn&#039;s hand almost as soon as you&#039;re done with your turn gives you the little time you need to plan your next turn.  Keeping track of the opposite directions is quite simple if you simply make your play, then gently smack the remainder of your hand down to the right, while looking to the player on your left.

...but the comment is still valid for my [b][bgcolor=#9999ff]&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] rating.  It just doesn&#039;t excite me as much as it did then.  ;^)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>First impression, 3p (me at Captain and Engineering, two 7-year-olds covering all other stations on a training mission):  This seems to be everything I hoped, if having a little more complex a learning curve than I might&#039;ve expected for a bunch of minigames.  I can see that if your Weapons officer or Helm officer are miserable at their jobs, this could get frustrating quickly, as you pray for a Station Change.  Fortunately, that card is — cleverly enough — a damage card in each of the four locations, so if officer ineptitude leads to damage, change cometh….
⋮
Alright!  Now we played a vaguely 7p game, with people coming and going from their stations, and others covering, but we finished the first training mission.  Woo!  This is definitely fun.  You live or die by your Weapons officer, though, so make sure you get a good flicker in that role.  A good enough flicker only needs to be able to complete one torpedo tube puzzle in order to be effective; however, if you can crank out four, and still make most of your flicks effective, the odds of mission success will rise dramatically.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.33

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Elegant descendant of Mancala:  Each player has three times three sizes of ships.  You select a planet with one of your ships on it, and then they move out, leapfrogging one another.  The large ones move out &quot;first&quot;, then the medium, then the small, making the largest seem to move slowly.  Try not to let your ships end up in the black holes!  Once a player is eliminated, everyone gets 4 for each surviving large they have, 3 for each medium, and 1 for each small.  Most points wins!  Very simple mechanisms, with some strategy and tactics.</comment>				</item>

I hadn&#039;t really been drawn to this game, despite (or perhaps because of) its festive presentation, and upon playing (and even winning), that feeling hasn&#039;t really changed; however, I should point out that I probably enjoyed it the least of the players.  Don&#039;t get me wrong:  It certainly wasn&#039;t bad.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I [b]love[/b] the concept, and the suspense of exploration, but it just doesn&#039;t work too well mechanically — that, or the rules aren&#039;t as clear as they should be about climbing.  For example, I think you should flesh out the path around you on the current level, as specified*, but whenever a [i]platform[/i] is created, you also automatically explore up to the point that sits atop that platform.

Something that doesn&#039;t work well physically is that you can move to any explored white point to which you&#039;re connected; however, a physical shibumi set doesn&#039;t allow for easy excavation of the pyramid in order to replace balls.

So, while the game seems technically broken with the current rules, the concept is so cool and unusual for the equipment that I can&#039;t in good conscience give it the [b][bgcolor=#ff0000] 1 [/bgcolor][/b] associated with brokenness.

[size=7]* Something [else] that doesn&#039;t work physically with the rules as written is that if I get up to the second level before finishing the first, and I explore over to an area that doesn&#039;t have a defined bottom floor… well, what do I do?  Undefined.[/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>This is a most unusual, but very cool, quick dexterity game.  You must perform a massé to get a ping pong ball into your hole on the other side of a wall.  This is actually quite simple, given the strange silicone brush/finger you use to - well - do a massé-style launch of the ball from your yoke.  I&#039;m apparently a ridiculous natural at this, so I think my enjoyment would be higher against another natural; however, it&#039;s still singular and very cool.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>The rules as they are have a simple flaw:  The game doesn&#039;t escalate; rather, it peters out, due to invalid rolls.  Also, the rules don&#039;t even mention what happens with invalid rolls.  That said, the components are wonderfully huge and chunky, and house rules fixes would be quite easy to devise.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I have mixed feelings about the fact that with four players, you start with a pool of 12 of the 26 red cards and four pawns to work with, but playing solitaire, you have only 3 of the 26 and only one pawn.  Thematically, sure, playing with more should be more rewarding and successful; however, if you&#039;re playing with fewer players, it&#039;s probably simply because you don&#039;t have the extra [i]Mitspieler[/i].  In practice, this means that deck has to stack itself much more favorably for fewer players to win.  On the other hand, one could argue that this is perfect, because it takes less time to play, and in a solitaire game, you want it to be challenging, suspenseful, and dangerous.

The design feels pretty good, though, sort of a reduction of [thing=37046][/thing], right down to the big baddie being more of a problem with more ghosts in play, and the normal losegame conditions still applying while you have to deal with the boss.  In this case, the boss&#039;s terrible power comes from the fact that her strength equals the total strength of all the other ghosts in play.

The single cruelest mechanism in this game is the &quot;afterspook&quot;:  After you whack a ghost, you are rewarded by something bad happening, which is either a new ghost coming off the bench to replace its defeated cohort, or the wasting of a potentially useful liberator card.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Due to the thematic nature of the rules, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m playing this correctly; however, it seems like a simultaneously stricter and more permissive take on SPuzzle:
Stricter: Same-colored balls sitting diagonally seems to be forbidden (referred to as a [i]break[/i], but that makes me think that the rule means [b]disconnected[/b] diagonal balls — i.e. having an L would be OK).
More permissive: You can have any number of balls in a group, as long as they don&#039;t form a tangle (or break?).

Until I learn clarified rules, my opinion of this game is a big, fat, right-in-the-middle question mark.</comment>				</item>

Your only income is from bonuses or stacking 5 or more dice on your turn, yet you often don&#039;t even have the option to stack 5 dice on your turn.  It&#039;s definitely a pretty fun idea - one which a variant would make great!  If you don&#039;t have a stable place to play this, it can be a little frustrating.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Firstly: The rules make little sense, functionally: Here, you get random cards that you aren&#039;t allowed to see until you surprise me (and yourself) with them. OK, fine, it&#039;s a random enough game, just go with it.

Secondly, and far more importantly: Two, and only two, of the cards are permanent; the rest you must trash to use, or they give you an &quot;on reveal&quot; ability (remember, you can&#039;t plan for it) and a trash-to-use ability. One of the permanents gives you access to an exclusive, for-you-only &quot;trade row&quot; card [b]at a discount[/b]. The other, way more powerful, triples the efficacy of your Vipers — [b]triples[/b] your Vipers every single time you play them. Unlike Bases and Outposts, there&#039;s no way to get rid of these permanents. They are highly imbalanced, and unwelcome except if you desire some hardcore handicapping.

It would be much more sensible to give each player a random permanent Gambit, plus a few others, and then draft. You know what you have, you can choose to reveal each card at a meaningful time.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Just random stuff that tends to affect both players (some won&#039;t apply &quot;fairly&quot;) that takes up space in the deck, making it harder to shuffle. I wouldn&#039;t have bought it, had I not been beseeched to bring All Things Star Realms home, but I had liked that they added a new type of card altogether. The graphic design pleases me, but ultimately, these feel like tumult added for tumult&#039;s sake.

Depending on my mood, I will sometimes insist that we ignore and scrap them when they come out of the deck.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 8.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I like that these add a new kind of card to the game. They also add choices, good. Single-use, disposable heroes that give you a quick mini-boost; and they&#039;re available at &quot;leftover&quot; prices. They aren&#039;t particularly interesting; however, I suppose they are good insurance for when you really needed that blasted symbol and didn&#039;t get it.

I don&#039;t think they&#039;re worth bloating the deck for, but whatever.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.00

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Firstly: The rules make little sense, functionally: Here, you get random cards that you aren&#039;t allowed to see until you surprise me (and yourself) with them. OK, fine, it&#039;s a random enough game, just go with it.

Secondly, and far more importantly: Two pairs, and only two pairs, of the cards are permanent; the rest you must trash to use, or they give you an &quot;on reveal&quot; ability (remember, you can&#039;t plan for it) and a trash-to-use ability. One of the permanents gives you an extra Military each turn; not a gamewrecker, but it adds up — especially if you got both of them. The other reduces damage against you by 1. This one is a bit of a gamewrecker, especially if you have both, because that can really cut down on the early-game damage. I&#039;m not a fan.

It would be much more sensible to give each player a random pair of permanent Gambits, plus a few others, and then draft. You would know what you have, you would be able to choose to reveal each card at a meaningful time.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 8.00

Someone astute at the table observed that the cards&#039; effects were at least partially from some other Catan expansion(s).  So, for some Catan fans, there will be nothing new here, but it&#039;s a fun way for hardcore Star Trek fans to enjoy a solid game set in the universe of the original series.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>While it captures the &quot;suspense&quot; of hit-or-miss combat, I just do not enjoy combat resolution by the roll of a die.  Strategy theoretically always matters, but if one player consistently rolls poorly while the other consistently rolls well, who do you think will win?  (I always respected OGRE&#039;s notion that the technology is good enough that you always hit:  It&#039;s just a question of how hard you hit.  It&#039;s a baby step in the right direction.)  The miniatures are cool because they&#039;re all the Star Wars ships, right?  No.  They have a sagging look to them, and are totally not to scale.  For instance, if one fighter has a detailed design and another of the same size has a simpler design, the fancy fighter&#039;s miniature is bigger.  While this keeps the cost down, it sucks even more out of the tiny pool of cool that this game managed to preserve.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The action cards for each miniature team do a very good job evoking the theme, and the teasing two actions per turn give nice, tough choices to the players.  This game provides combat by card play, which I always prefer over combat by die roll.  Perhaps this would be more fun for me as a two-player game.  Certainly, I think it would improve with subsequent plays, because you better understand the strategies you should consider with whatever major character you are using.  I expected to rate this a 4, but I&#039;m surprised that I must confess it&#039;s actually more of a 5 for me.  I suppose I should play it again sometime.</comment>				</item>

The innovations aren&#039;t even good design; they&#039;re just a deviation from the normal abysmal stuff: Roll one die to move; if it&#039;s odd, move laterally (i.e. fairly useless), but if it&#039;s even, move toward the goal.  The board is covered (30%?) with go-back-to-start spaces, but 13/21 of them can&#039;t be reached, according to the way the die rolls will move you.  They may just be there to heighten the sense of danger.  Nonetheless, at least each player has two pieces to move (a choice!) and can choose which direction along the prescribed axis the piece will move.

Eh, what do you expect for free?  At least they make just about the entire box useful for purposes beyond containing tasty cereal — purposes which &quot;trick&quot; the consumer into cutting down the box to very, very recyclable sheets.  :ninja:</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>As I recall, even with the Chance and Community Chest cards to send players to the Stock Exchange, we felt the number of stocks a player could actually acquire in a game was woefully low.  By upping the number of stocks you could buy on the rare occasion of landing on the Stock Exchange, we enjoyed this expansion quite a bit more.  In addition, the values of the stocks, in comparison to your likelihood to gather them up, makes them fairly insignificant by the time you have to worry about paying $2000 on Boardwalk.  I love the concept, though.

I understand the weakness of this expansion now that I know that the version I bought in the 1990s was veritably untweaked from the original (of which I was ignorant) published in 1936.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>Interesting choices to make, although some can almost be made on autopilot each turn.  If the dice are constantly cruel to you, there&#039;s not much you can do about it, which is something I prefer to see mitigated in interesting ways in dice games.  No, alas, Stone Age pretty specifically and exclusively rewards high rolls at every moment.  That said, the choices make this about the closest thing you could have to a dice-driven Pillars of the Earth with a dash of Agricola and La Città (must... feed... growing... populace).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Based on solitaire 5p trial game:  The security guard adds a small element of hot potato to the game, and a little bit of weak spite, but nothing too disruptive to play.  You quickly find yourself deciding whether you should be grabbing T-shirts or seating your fans; however, since there is no competition for the shirts, and you can only get half you points that way, seating your fans is generally preferable.  On the other hand, if you seat more than 5 of your fans in the early part of the game, you might not be able to sprint as fast for shirts to end the game in your favor.  Again, this depends pretty heavily on the cards.

Success depends pretty heavily on what cards you draw, but since it plays pretty quickly, this is fine.  It could be interesting to add a little Moon-style public drafting of cards.  It certainly would add tension!

Note on the instructions:  &quot;spaces&quot; seem to refer only to the 30 numbered spaces.  Disregard the 60 stones of the inner ring.  I think of it as the fencing to keep the fans out. :)

Production note:  I found it useful to use two bars from a 6th color (from the expansion) in order to suggest a queue that starts at 1, and ends at 30, guiding the fans out to the merchandise.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Great puzzle!  The mechanisms are ingenious, and the thing is designed to hold everything you need to play, without a bag.  Unfortunately, you could lose &quot;water&quot; on the go, so a bag is probably appropriate for travel.

It is so satisfying to shift the water around with the boats.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>This is a fast, agonizing auction game — but probably not like any other you&#039;ve ever played.  There will be 35 auctions over the course of the game, and you have 24 cards you can use to try to win them.  What a start!

At the start of each of the five rounds, you draw as many cards as you like (looking at each as you draw it).  Then, you group them into bids, aware of the seven auctions coming, but not what your opponents are willing to bid on the &quot;items&quot;.  Your winnings can include point-scoring (and possibly privilege-garnering) seats on the council, items to sell, plots of land to buy, opportunity to sell items (the [b]only[/b] way to generate cash), and control over beside whose people the point-scoring chapel or edifice are built, depending on the auction.  All this is fueled not only by the direct points they provide, but also by the 1-5 task cards you kept at the beginning of the game.  Like [thing=9209][/thing], you are rewarded for success, and punished for failure.  Unlike [thing=9209][/thing], failure scores you -3 points, regardless of how large — or small — the task&#039;s reward was.  It still stings.

Timing your best bids — or more over, [b]sufficient[/b] bids — for those crucial auctions, and remaining open to scarf up the unexpectedly less-desired items is a fun bit o&#039; agony, especially as you mow through your paltry deck of 24 cards (values 1-6).</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.12

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This [b][bgcolor=#9999ff]&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] is a tentative rating.  I say that because I tend enjoy Heinrich Glumpler&#039;s designs, but occasionally, I don&#039;t realize how much I do on the first play.  By the end of my first game, the elements of the design that you can control and manipulate to your advantage became more evident, and I rose, in a 6p game (but you always have 7 cars), from last or near-last to first place.  I snagged first place in the last stretch of the race from one of the Old Pros.  Clearly, I&#039;d started to &quot;get it&quot;, but I didn&#039;t &quot;get it&quot; for enough of the game to really assess my feelings about it.  Looking forward to my next crazy Glumpler race!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Tentative rating after a brutal first play.  This is a game you could learn from a friend in maybe 15 minutes, and fumble your way through a little slowly the first time... or both players could learn it from the rulebooks, and you take forever to figure it out.  It&#039;s relatively intuitive play that isn&#039;t explained so intuitively.

As a game, it&#039;s interesting, and has some good mechanisms to give you a definite wargame feel with eurogame-style choices feeding the action.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.10

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>2014-01-14 [b]First impression (2p):[/b] [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b] There&#039;s a whole lot of obtuseness to this game, but I started to appreciate some strategic nuances, although I still am not sure I have a grasp on the game.  Definitely be sure to play this several times in a short timeframe, lest you never progress in your grasp of the game.  I&#039;m sure once we get it, we&#039;ll be good.  The question is, will the game?  Also, I&#039;ve had a couple of epiphanies since playing, so I&#039;m more interested in replaying it.

2014-01-19 [b]Second impression (4p):[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] Given time between games to have a few epiphanies, I enjoyed this much more.  In this game, however, the player who won was my opponent last game, and she just plowed ahead claiming cities, and won with more than twice as many points as second place.  It strikes me that either people have to fight hard over the cities (I was [b]just[/b] starting to try to take her key cities when she got enough points), or hope that she gambled too much, and had the loser on her team.  More play required….</comment>	<conditiontext>#_/200</conditiontext>			<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.50

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>2012-08-17: It seems mega-fiddly at first, as you cross-reference this hex with that hex, but it actually tends to ease up after that, and is an excellent game.

2015-09-18: The Casino is a tile that should be removed if you play versus Dale the Bot (solitaire), because it is hideously broken without the high cost to offset it. Him paying $3 for it as soon as it hits the line easily gets him over 300 points by game end. That&#039;s just not fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>This is an excellent family game, because there is enough gamer satisfaction in here to keep them interested, but its mechanisms are simple enough for young children to play along — perhaps even competitively, depending on their aptitude for strategy and grasp or intuition of the fruit values.  The theme is a spectacular fit for this abstract game:  I [b]love[/b] the torpor mechanism.  Yes, you will always see it get used at the end of the game, but it&#039;s those small uses for it (short naps) in the middle of the game that make me adore it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Turns are suspenseful and the feel of them is slightly reminiscent of [gameid=497], because the odds that what you choose not to keep for your hand is going to give you pains are pretty decent.  It&#039;s a nice game.

I wonder how it plays with more than one person per team....</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>2007-07: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6.5 [/bgcolor][/b] The basic game (plus water rights) is extremely opportunistic.  If you score big, it&#039;s at least as much because the player before you set you up for it, as because you played well.  Nonetheless, it&#039;s pleasant to play with the jigsaw pieces.  I look forward to playing with more layers of the rules slathered on.

2009-07-10: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] Awesome puzzle pieces used for a pretty decent tile-laying game (in which the tiles happen to fit together jigsaw-style).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is a nice descendant of Pickomino / Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck.  The die-locking mechanism is completely identical.  This time the roll screwage comes not in the form of &quot;you must have worms&quot;, but in requiring you to be able to do something.  If you can&#039;t, you take the worst negative on the table.  The dice themselves have not values, but abilities, which if rolled in sufficient number permit you to either take a sushi bit in a specific position, take a bone in a specific position, take the top sushi from an opponent, take the top bone from an opponent, take any sushi from an opponent, or take any bone from an opponent.  Since you only score as many sushi (positive) as you have bones (negative), but score all your bones, you have huge incentive to take the most positive sushi and bones, but timing which to do when can be challenging.

Like its predecessor, the game length depends heavily on how much theft goes on.  Still, nice little game.

Note:  The tiles are about half the thickness of Pickomino&#039;s.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Very easy to learn, with great mechanisms that make the players face difficult decisions about how they want to apply their employees.  As with Master Builder, events can cause workers to be useless; unlike Master Builder, you know in advance what those events can be, and can work against them.
Bonus:  How many games reward you for having unpersecuted Christians in your employ and for having freed your slaves?  Heh heh heh.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>[microbadge=16256] 2011-05-04 Nice, challenging, lateral thinking game of perfect strategy.  As with [thing=1890][/thing] and [thing=8548][/thing], pieces can be merged and split for combined effect.  Each game has its own spin on it, though:  Plateau allows bluffing and sneak attacks on an even smaller (4×4) board, but as with Symbol, the stack moves like one of the pieces therein.  Unlike Symbol, with most piece types, you can move as far as the stack is tall.  Also, you can scoop up or drop off pieces as you go.  In Gounki, the combined units allow you to use all the movement points of the components in whatever order you wish.
Symbol establishes its uniqueness:  Each unit type has special abilities that are optionally additive in a stack.  Each type has unique movement (or lack thereof) — you choose one unit to &quot;carry&quot; the others in the stack (opposite of Plateau, which uses the top side of the top piece of the stack).  Each unit also has a restriction, which is sort of subtractive in a stack — i.e. &quot;blue can&#039;t be on land&quot; becomes irrelevant if something land-friendly is carrying it.
Because of the way Symbol&#039;s piece powers combine, you effectively have 63 types of unit at your disposal, to be constructed or split on the fly, as you choose, during the game.  This means there is [b]much[/b] to explore.</comment>				</item>

[microbadge=16259] ([b]hex[/b]): [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] This is my favorite [thing=63661][/thing] board so far.  The hex movement feels more natural (as usual), and the particular layout more readily permits convoys and other interesting developments.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Normal game: Very cool constraint notion, but it feels &quot;solvable&quot;.

25-match variant: Very good, tense game of putting constraints on your opponent.  I think [thing=58907][/thing] — a re-make of it in [boardgamefamily=20][/boardgamefamily] — is a better take on it, though, because you have a fixed set of pieces, rather than &quot;building&quot; your own, as you need, out of the supply of matches.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Excellent!  Yes, it&#039;s just [thing=95138][/thing], implemented with [boardgamefamily=20][/boardgamefamily], but it takes a set of constraints and tightens them a little more, because you can&#039;t &quot;build units&quot; of whatever size suits your needs.  You must work with your stash....

Oh!  And 5 suits of [thing=2860][/thing] are, of course / by design, the perfect board for this, too!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 8.00

Simply extrapolate the face-up card scaling:  Put out 3 cards each turn for two players.  ...and you&#039;ll probably need to use more palaces than just your own.  :^)</comment>				</item>

Its art is cute, and the theme is so very manga; however, while there are icons to represent certain common effects, they are on two corners of the card, so you can&#039;t see them by fanning the cards.  Also, the card costs are in a corner, but the Love is not, so if you fan your cards in the usual way, wishing to see how much Love you have to spend, instead of 1, 1, 2, 3, you see 1, 1, 4, 7.  Also, I am not a fan of the directed permanent damage, such as Bad Habits.  Finally, as with [thing=53953][/thing], the escalation doesn&#039;t seem to feel quite right.  [thing=69789]Ascension[/thing] has this issue, too, but that game is always progressing quickly, even if escalation stalls.</comment>	<conditiontext>[b]Tanto Cuore[/b] — English — all sleeved in pink-backed sleeves, superb condition

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Completely pointless.  These are just five of the base game&#039;s cards with full-card illustrations.  It&#039;s not even a useful set of five:  The two Chief Maids (VP cards), and three of the ten unique Private Maids.  You wouldn&#039;t make doubles of the Private Maids available, and having a 33rd and a 34th Chief (one of each, that is) is comparably pointless.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The rulebook choices are pretty poor.  The summary, named &quot;Full Rules&quot; is excellent, and even in a style I might have used; however, they are useless for learning the game, because they lack illustrations.  Don&#039;t call something from which you can&#039;t learn the game &quot;Full Rules&quot;.

The Guidebook has that unfortunate narrative tutorial style [person=789][/person] seems to love, but which is decent (at best) only if you are reading the rules by yourself, with no one around.  There is also this severely unfortunate sentence: &quot;Each player chooses a different deck, but use only two colors of pieces, one complete set for each team.&quot;  So much clearer would be: &quot;Each player chooses a different deck; however, each team shares one color of pieces.&quot;

Alright, primary gripes out of the way, this is a weird but very cool concept, and I was really getting into it by the end of the first game.  I look forward to playing it some more, and giving people the 5-minute education that will save them nearly an hour in the documentation.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.14

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is a really quick game that reduces World War II naval battles to a quick, simple, abstract-feeling card game.  You must second-guess your opponent, but doing so rarely goes like you&#039;d think, since the triggers for two of the three types of battles require four (carriers) or five (battleships) of the six cards played to be the same.  Otherwise, it&#039;s torpedoes.  In my limited experiences, the battle tends to be a battleship big gun skirmish.  It&#039;s a very portable, inexpensive game, quite suitable for killing a few minutes with an acquaintance.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s rather rare that I part with my money for a game I haven&#039;t played; however, having played Sopwith many times with my parents when I growing up (which I suppose I haven&#039;t really achieved), and loving Robo Rally, I could tell I was going to enjoy this one.  ...and enjoy it I do!  While I am supremely bad at estimating where the curved trails will put me, the miraculous accidents are quite entertaining.  Since you choose how much flight you want to plan, and thus how much risk you want to take, at a sacrifice of speed (since you&#039;re skipping more turns to fly than someone who flies quite well and fills the spellbook each time), the game automatically scales well for experience.  In addition, the missions in the game help to ramp up the difficulty gradually.  Top notch, and inexpensive, to boot!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>This is such a departure from [thing=11]Bohnanza[/thing]&#039;s fundamental rules that if you&#039;ve played [thing=11]Bohnanza[/thing], you probably won&#039;t adapt to Telebohn on the first game.  Also, the earlier English translation on BGG ([filepage=7480]Telebohn.doc, uploaded 2004/11/14[/filepage]) has some mistranslations - I&#039;ve uploaded [filepage=10097]my lovingly hand-translated special action card text[/filepage].
So, with the correct meaning of the cards, this is a pretty fun game.  The flow is much more &quot;selfish&quot; than when you are trading beans, but your &quot;hostile takeover&quot; (forceful swap) of someone else&#039;s field may actually help them, so it&#039;s always interesting to play.
Fascinatingly, some of the special action cards are single-shots of the rules from other Bohnanza (and Al Cabohne) games, so those of us with all of them can experience a wider variety of expansions without playing with 438 bean cards.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Tempus and [thing=60]Vinci[/thing] do the best job (in my limited experience) of providing a map-based civilization game with interesting decisions to make.  As the conflicts arise in Tempus, you get at least a little sense of unforeseeable danger, which you will have to choose to riskily disregard, or with which you must deal.  Still, my award for civilization games goes to [thing=25613]Through the Ages[/thing]; however, it is a civ card game that uses no map, so it&#039;s not a fair comparison.

The particular multipurpose use of the cards in Tempus is quite nice, but still can leave you with cards that are useless for your situation (other than for bluffing, which can bleed off your opponents&#039; cards).  Also, the Cafe games edition is beautiful, with cards that shuffle perfectly.</comment>	<conditiontext>Like new

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Though it plays 2-6 people, you shouldn&#039;t approach the high end of that range unless ALL the players are experienced with Terakh.  There are some interesting concepts here to liven up this elimination game; however, it is a grueling elimination game for up to 6 players.  Comparisons to risk are quite fair.  You have cards to add chaos, but this is boils down to a fancy wargame with die rolls for combat resolution - something of which I am not a fan.  I prefer the harsh brutality of knowing that I lost my unit because I played poorly and/or my opponent played well, rather than the happenstance that my opponent rolled the die &quot;well&quot; when I rolled &quot;poorly&quot;.  Also, the downtime is incredible with many players:  Other than the possibility of rolling the occasional defense die, or playing a card defensively, with 6 players there could be TEN TURNS between your last turn and next one.  (The maximum between-turn downtime is 2p-2 turns, where p is the number of players.)  That said, StonePlay&#039;s production of the game is amazing:  Heavy, felt-bottomed, triangular boards; a heavy, metal coin to flip for play direction, circular plastic pieces that look like they came from a Venn diagram (which means you will fidget incessantly with your &quot;downed Inkas&quot;).  This game is not to my tastes, but I can see this really appealing to some, and the production values would just push it up a few more notches for them.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Take [thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing].  Remove the cloister.  Add a temple, which scores rather uniquely.  Replace the farm scoring with the field scoring from [thing=4390]Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers[/thing].  Add one ark, which you may move 1-5 spaces, rather than placing a follower.  Add a one-shot prophet, a follower who goes to a city in an attempt to score double in that city.  Add oases along the roads that each add one point to the completed roads.  Tweak the scoring of incomplete features a bit.  Now you have Ark of the Covenant.

The ark doesn&#039;t do much worthwhile, unless you&#039;ve run yourself out of followers (not as likely in this game as in a nicely expanded [thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing]), or have drawn a crap tile.  ...and happen to have followers within 5 spaces of the ark, and a way to reach them without giving your opponents comparable points.  (The ark in this game is not nearly as exciting as Indiana Jones might suspect.)  Still, it&#039;s a fun enough game to play.  Its subtle differences from the other [family=2]Carcassonnes[/family] can bite you if you don&#039;t read the rules carefully, but a good and worthwhile game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A dice-dependent tactical game with items of varied seriousness (yet all believable, for such a situation) for the protagonists, and interesting proliferation and growth decisions for the antagonists, this game&#039;s art and character really add to the experience.  If you happen to own the plastic travel case version of the game, then it is a very portable diversion that should play enough differently each time to keep it fresh.  I first found this game in the 1980s, and I even now get the craving (I feel it at this very second!) to play this game on occasion!

Dice-based combat resolution bothers me a lot less when the whole game is kind of crazy:  Not knowing what effect an item will have until you use it really sets the tone of the game, and the dice are right at home in this classic.</comment>				</item>

The only other game that gave this dual-race sense was the saber race in Caveman Games for the Commodore 64.  Even once you&#039;ve seen your opponent cross the finish line, you&#039;re still running with all you&#039;ve got so the sabertooth tiger doesn&#039;t make a snack of you.  Ahh, what a party game — what a digression!

ANYWAY, this is not a mentally challenging game, by any means, but for those times when you want a simple game that is still interesting to play, TDCG fits the bill nicely.</comment>				</item>

They also provide slightly tricky choices as you accumulate the fish.  I haven&#039;t yet seen the boot enter play, which is clearly a king-basher, and grants even more benefit to victory point card holders.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The consensus from my fellow players and passers-by who&#039;ve played this is that it runs way longer than advertised.  I have faith that as players become as familiar with the new options as with the old, the game won&#039;t take too much longer than the base game - 5th and 6th players notwithstanding.  I LOVE that the expansion addresses The Big Gripe about this brilliant game, in that you can no longer get stuck with the last three actions.  The worst you can do now is last two out of the bag, then first of the last-in-first-out third-builders.  ...or first out of the bag (and pay), last out of the bag, then last of the LIFO third-builders, depending on your perspective.  The crusades are an excellent option for your workers.  France is incredibly useful, and adds the sneakiest new aspect to the game, but is certainly the new feature that will see the least time reduction with familiarity, because it necessitates looking at everyone else&#039;s craftsmen each round.  This is a great expansion to a superb game.  Its only flaw is the game length it adds.  It certainly spices the game up wonderfully.</comment>				</item>

The concept is rather like [thing=979]its predecessor[/thing], though without a gameboard, and with enough of a twist that it&#039;s different.  The ability to &quot;steal&quot; a villain from someone and put it at the back of the villain queue provides an interesting lead-buster that isn&#039;t a guarantee.  Good fun!</comment>				</item>

Also, the game does present a small suspense factor with the risk built into the market roll:  Unless the player chooses the start position rather than rolling, there is a 6.0125% chance that the turn track skips forward a turn..</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The tactical choices available each turn are always interesting, but they don&#039;t build to a greater whole-game interest.  A large part of that is probably the fact that you pretty much have to ignore the game until your turn goes around, since there&#039;s basically nothing you can do.  This would be a great candidate for a turn-based web game, since you wouldn&#039;t need to see anything between your turns.</comment>				</item>

The concept feels rock solid, but I think it needs to be realized in a larger game, dare I say it.  That said, it still seems rather interesting to try to control your destiny….

Oh, yes, and the score tracker is horrific, although an interesting idea.  I think it could have worked as magnets, but as tiny bits of cardboard?  Even without sneezes, coughs, or sighs, the minuscule things far too easily lose their position on the scoretrack spine thingy.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 5.00

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The concept sounds like it could be interesting if well play-balanced.  …but the progressive suit sizes actually lead to plenty of helplessness when playing.  Example: You have a 10-red goal, with a −13 &quot;bid token&quot;, trump is one of the less-frequent suits, of which you have few or none. You win zero tricks, and take 23 points of badness.  Not my idea of fun.  Sorry, guys.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This game has a pleasantly unusual feel to it, and is quite interesting to play, for how simple it is.  Unfortunately, it can be a bit meticulous to tally and count the effects of your actions, which makes me ready to move on before the game is done.  A computer implementation would easily rate a whole point higher, as could some ingenious ways to tally it all a bit more quickly.  Definitely pleasant, though.</comment>				</item>

2010-12-03: [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff]&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] This is supposed to be fun?  Grind away, turn after turn, unable to defeat any of the monsters?  Oh, wait, there&#039;s one I can beat, revealed at the end of my turn, and of course, it at the beatable one after it are gone before my next turn.  Lather, rinse, get soap in your eyes.  There are some nice mechanisms at work here, but what the heck?  I&#039;m assured that it is usually quite fun, and I should try it again.  I shall, when I have another two hours to blow on nothing more fun.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Ferries requiring locomotives is an interesting touch, though since they&#039;re around the perimeter, a player may never have to face that challenge in a game.  The stations are a nice compensation for being otherwise cut off from connecting a ticket&#039;s destinations, especially with the tradeoff of their being worth 4 points each if you can spare them.  The tunnels, though, are what bring greater suspense to the game.  Making sure you have enough extra cars of that color (or locomotives) you have in your hand before connecting a tunnel, so you don&#039;t effectively miss a turn, while trying to minimize time wasted in collecting cards you don&#039;t need is a nice element of gambling.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>The passengers add some insidious, point-&quot;stealing&quot; strategies to the Ticket to Ride formula.  If you wait too long building up your passenger&#039;s path, he may pick up much less than you thought, as your opponent rides your lines using passenger cards.  On the other hand, collect passenger cards for too long, and you may get cut off from completing your Destination Cards&#039; routes, taking serious negative points at the end.  If you&#039;re just going to keep improving this game, Alan, keep up the good work!</comment>				</item>

Also, although you&#039;ve always been able to cut off people&#039;s probable paths in Ticket to Ride games, this is the fist game in which you deal the damage to existing work, knowingly.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>In Fairy Tale, you draft cards, and then just score what you drafted. Tides of Time is very similar, except you lock one card in each round, and remove one card from the game each round, replace those two in your hand, and keep working with your 40% different hand. Simple rules, mildly convoluted scoring, and phenomenal art.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.00

It&#039;s so challenging to plan your temporal excursions in an optimal way… when your opponent can interrupt your plans via time travel, as well.  There are several video games that accomplish this for a single-player experience, but having another human in your space-time puzzle really gets the head spinning.  Just fantastic.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Though the layout of the game requires significant pushing about of the cards in the timeline, the effect is worthwhile:  Plotting successful sale of your goods can be tricky - a feat likely much more difficult with 5 players than 2, since every purchase of commodities alters the timeline and future pricing.  The timeline on which you purchased item X may become severed from the future where you need to sell X.  I&#039;d love to see (and may have to make) a computerized implementation of this.  I think this game could be 8.5, were it implemented on BrettSpielWelt, for instance.</comment>	<conditiontext>Like new

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I normally don&#039;t go for pick-specific-neighbors-to-attack games, but this one is really interesting and works well.  There&#039;s so much unusual going on with this streamlined space combat game — not the least of which being the planets available as incentives, and the conditions that constrain the current conflict.  Very cool game!  Two of my first opponents promptly bought a copy when we were done.  Huge bonus:  The card art is lush and immersive.

Also, I really like the risk/reward give/take in this game.</comment>				</item>

The ability to build your &quot;arsenal&quot; of extra dice and manipulation in whatever balance you choose - and the dice allow - as you vie for this or that, and ultimately the king, always seems to amount to a pleasurable endeavor.

The Tokaido itself being a time track certainly helps make the game more strategic, and forces you to make some interesting choices and sacrifices along the way.

It&#039;s also a bonus that you always choose (or are assigned ;)) a character to play, with his or her unique ability in the game.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 6.00

They&#039;re very useful when you want to take a shot to shift things with no risk of rendering a slice ineligible with your new puck, but you probably are sacrificing 2 points if you fail.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Very fast and shockingly fun.  Nothing about this game&#039;s visuals tempts me to play it; however more involved graphics would make it nearly impossible to play!  Had I not heard three friends beside me having an absolute blast playing it, I doubt I ever would have tried it myself.  I&#039;m glad I did.  It&#039;s a fast game of tricky pattern recognition, but because you play the whole darn thing in real time, it&#039;s lively and fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The game is thematically spot on:  You choose where to build your six trailers, then ten tornadoes rip through the park utterly randomly, according to die rolls and a movement chart.  Although the movement of the tornado is suspenseful, the only choices you make in the game are the locations of your trailers.  Then you just roll a die ten to infinite times (seriously), and move the tornado according to a movement chart, destroying everything in its path.  Actually, there&#039;s more point to the solitaire game because, like solitaire [gameid=13503], you have to predict the winner.  Unlike [gameid=13503], instead of deciding everything, you only choose those trailer locations at the start.

This is one of those games about which people say, &quot;Well, it&#039;s a lot more fun if you bet on it,&quot; like [gameid=3522].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Here is a game that has the distinction of being a strategic and tactical game that (provided sufficient bits) you can play with [b]eight players[/b] in about an hour, due to [geeklist=74936]simultaneous play[/geeklist].  The only &quot;downtime&quot; is when you are on the edge of your seat, seeing how that island on which you were vying for dominance ends up scoring.  Because of the ingenious indirect scoring mechanism, you really get to work the plotting and scheming centers of your gray matter — that, or get some big surprises.  With minimal downtime, and fast play, I can&#039;t wait for this one to hit the streets.  I hope we get to have an 8-player version, because that would fill a spot that I had accepted as no-games-land before I played 8p [b]Tradewinds[/b]:  An eight-player game between the brevity and lightness of [thing=16992][/thing] and the sometimes epic nature and botched programs of [thing=18][/thing].</comment>				</item>

Although it&#039;s a fusion of deck-building and track-laying, I do not find it to be a synergistic combination, unlike the brilliant [thing=144567]For the Crown[/thing], which combines two even more disparate things, but then enhances it to make every decision interesting and tough.  Every card you play.  [b]Trains[/b] seems to take its two parents&#039; concepts, and somehow make the decisions [b]less[/b] interesting.  It has plenty of fans, and I have plenty of games; we won&#039;t miss each other….</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.84

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>In this edition, the super-shortcut is basically pointless, since you have merely 2/3 the distance to travel, and taking two steps instead of four is not nearly as nice a benefit as the two-instead-of-six of the original Aggravation.  The packaging is simultaneously cheaply constructed and well designed.  All the necessary parts fit within the one-piece, foldup board/box.  If you want a slight variation of [gameid=2136] which you can play in the car or on public transportation, this isn&#039;t a bad option.</comment>				</item>

[b][gameid=31594][/b] Expansion II: [b]The Superevents[/b]

[b][gameid=13642][/b] Expansion: [b]The Favorite[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] — This adds a little variety to the game and a few more choices, now that you have the special action board, but it doesn&#039;t drastically alter the feel of the game — which is fine by me!

[b][gameid=25554][/b] Expansion: [b]New Persons[/b] [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] — This is a rather nice set of new grey people to hire.  There are a couple that can be rather risky to use, but used back-to-back in tandem, they provide an incredible payoff.  I like them!  Because the new cards require you to randomly select the 3×A, 3×B, and 3×C, everyone gets to review which nine are in the game before it starts.  These new cards inject more replay value into one of the most replayable games I&#039;ve ever played.  Bravo!

[b][gameid=555][/b] [b]The Muse and the Princess Expansion[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] — It&#039;s an interesting twist to add to the game.  It also serves the purpose of adding distraction from the goal, and money drain to the game, which I welcome.  The bad part is that each card can be very, very powerful in the right circumstances, so players need to learn the relative values of the characters in those situations.  Muse abuse, for example, can catapult a player into the lead....

[b][gameid=555][/b] [b]Two Player Rules[/b]

[b][gameid=3076][/b] Expansion I: [b][thing=12382]The New Buildings[/thing][/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8.9 [/bgcolor][/b] Excellent addition to the base game.  By randomizing the buildings available, the dynamic from game to game is a refreshing challenge.

[b][gameid=3076][/b] Expansion II: [b]The Nobles[/b] [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] — These are a splendid fit.  The buildings&#039; conditional functions are a little more difficult to digest at first, but they add quite a dose of freshening to the game.

[b][gameid=8217][/b] Expansion I: [b]The New Buildings[/b]

[b][gameid=8217][/b] Expansion II: [b]The Events[/b]

[b][gameid=34084][/b] Expansion I: [b]The 6th Player[/b] [b][bgcolor=#00cc00] 10 [/bgcolor][/b] — The 6th player components are perfectly fine and welcome, and the additional potions are perfectly fine.  The crow tokens are an excellent addition, so the people who take crow-bearing potions needn&#039;t keep them face up.  Plus, it&#039;s a little easier to see that the crows have flown away than it is to count up to the right number at all times, especially with more players.

[b][gameid=34084][/b] Expansion II: [b]The Amulets[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] — Nice.  This adds some more choices to the game, and the amulets are rigged to encourage you to play them.  So, being the last person in turn order doesn&#039;t guarantee you the &quot;I am...&quot; role.  This keeps the suspense higher, as it&#039;s not always apparent how each round will play out....

[b][gameid=34084][/b] Expansion III: [b]The Magic Abilities[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] — By giving each player a card, and the start player two extra, drafting your special card for the round is expedited, since only two of the cards are newly passed to you.  Nonetheless, it inevitably slows the game a bit.  ...especially with 6 players, since you blow through the deck every two sets, which means you just keep seeing the same abilities over and over.  Better with fewer players, methinks.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The downtime in this game is useless, because you can do and plan nothing until you roll the die at the beginning of your turn.  Then you have some choices; however, unless one of the choices is a winning move, the options are usually fairly arbitrary, because you have no idea what moves subsequent rolls will require you to make.  As a result, it can be a &quot;one step forward, eight steps sideways&quot; kind of game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>The titular trench really defines this game. The same pieces on the same board, sans trench, might still provide a decent battle of wits; however, the protection from frontal assaults, allowance of brutal charges, vulnerability to rear attack, and trench-walkers&#039; immunity from one another turn this into an agonizing grapple for domination, and allow its stark, lovely, abstract presentation to evoke its World War I commemoration quite effectively.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>NULL</wishlistcomment></item>

[b]Steeplechase Championships[/b], for 2-4 players, uses a linear path of obstacles, each labeled with the rolls (on two dice) required to pass it.  For instance, to start, you need to roll 2-5; then to clear the water jump, 6-9; then for the brick wall, 10-12.  To clear the logs at the end, you need to roll doubles.  More mundane than Ride-em Cowboy, but a better way to pass the time if you&#039;re bored.

[b]Ride-em Cowboy[/b] (a rodeo game for 1-4 players) is appropriately hellish to score decently on.  It did a good job of simulating a rodeo, in that you often wouldn&#039;t stay on the bronco long enough to score, and occasionally, someone would ride the whole way out.

[b]Ride the High Country[/b] was just a basic and inane roll-and-move for 2-4 extremely bored &quot;players&quot;.

[b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5.5 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]ReC[/b] would probably be worthy of adaptation into a mechanism for a more complex game.
[b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4.0 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]SC[/b] is a mindless, yet slightly suspenseful pastime.
[b][bgcolor=#ff3366] 2.0 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]RtHC[/b] isn&#039;t even worth the words I&#039;ve wasted on it so far.</comment>				</item>

[b]Curse of the Pyramid[/b] was an enjoyable race for 1 player.  You mark half the die&#039;s numbers as belonging to the mummy, then roll the die.  If the mummy&#039;s numbers roll, he moves toward the goal; if not, then you move the actual number rolled.  Of course, your path is substantially longer than his.  You also are required to change the mummy&#039;s numbers each turn.

[b]Vampire Attack[/b] lets 2-4 players attempt to bite each other.  On your turn, roll the die, then move orthogonally with up to one 90° turn per move, in an attempt to sidle up to another player.  Once you get orthogonally adjacent to an opponent, roll again.  A 1 (appropriately, the big, red pip) means you&#039;ve bitten them and they&#039;re out of the game.

[b]Escape the Evil Castle[/b] is a spiteful race game for 2-4 players.  Players traverse a linear path toward the goal, advancing the roll of a die each turn.  However, your roll also moves Dracula, whom you can move in either direction.  If you move dracula onto an opponent, she must move her pawn back to the 0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% mark.

[b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6.5 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]CotP[/b] is a gambling-driven race game for one player, and delivers a suspenseful pastime.
[b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4.0 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]VA[/b] features entirely die-based movement on a 15×10 board, for the 1/6 chance to exercise player elimination.  The decision you get is when to turn during each movement.
[b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4.5 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]EtEC[/b] offers a tactical choice each turn, with the prolong-the-game mechanism of sending opponents back to a safe point.</comment>				</item>

[b]Save the Whale[/b] is a bit of a misnomer for this game for 2-4 players.  As the whale moves slowly around the outside of the main playfield, players try to exit the playfield directly on or adjacent to the whale, scoring 10 or 5 points respectively.  The goal is 25 points.  About 2/3 of the playfield&#039;s spaces have arrows depicting the valid exit directions from that space.

[b]Cheetah Race[/b] is pretty much a rethemed, 2-player version of the solitaire game Curse of the Pyramid from Triple Flips 2: Monsters.  Each of you is racing agains your own &quot;time&quot;, as well as each other.

[b]Call of the Wild[/b] is a game of progress for 1 player.  You have four animals to progress along their respective tracks.  The tracks vary in length from 11 spaces to 19 spaces.  In ten turns, you try to get the four animals as close to the goal as possible.  Each turn, you roll the die, and choose an animal to move.  If you roll a 1, then you roll again, and move an animal double the second roll.

[b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6.0 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]StW[/b] is an abstract tactical game with a very loosely pasted theme.  Though movement is die-based, plotting your move is engaging.
[b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5.0 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]CR[/b] shows that a 2-player rendition of a solitaire game tends to be less fun than the solitaire.
[b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4.0 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]CotW[/b] provides very simple choices each turn, but it does pass the time. For a slightly more interesting variant, force yourself to choose the animal before the roll each turn.</comment>				</item>

[b]Save the Earth[/b] is a 1-player game that seems to be inspired by Missile Command.  Four missiles are bearing down on Earth, and you make straight, orthogonal moves based on the die roll, trying to hit the missiles before they reach Earth.  Each turn, the missiles advance - although, if you are blocking a missile&#039;s path downward, it will wait until you are out of the way to advance.  You essentially have 9 turns to fly around frantically to destroy the four missiles - well, 7 for two of them.

[b]Time Warp[/b] is a simple elimination game for 2-4 players, comprising two concentric, rectangular tracks - past and future - interconnected at four points by time machines.  That is the gimmick.  Roll, then move one way or the other, trying to land on an opponent to eliminate her.  If you land on a time machine, you may use it to switch tracks and go again.

[b]Robot Attack[/b] is a 2-player game which I&#039;d have to say is a cousin of Hnefatafl.  One player tries to traverse the passageways, by orthogonal moves from her die roll, to her spaceship, which conveniently lies behind the opponent&#039;s four robots.  The robot player tries to trap the other player with his robots, by splitting each roll among however many robots he wishes.  Not only are the robots inherently ¼ the speed of the spaceman, but they also are unable to move backward, toward the ship.  As a result, the robot player must be attentive in his move choices.  Fortunately for him, most of the board has four or fewer chokepoints to cover at any given vertical slice; unfortunately, players are neither allowed to waste pips from their die roll, nor retread a space on the same turn.

[b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5.6 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]StE[/b] is a tense solitaire game, though your success is mostly determined by the die.  Roll nine ones, you will lose.  On the other hand, with decent rolls, you have to make good gambles with your moves in order to succeed, so there is some risk-taking to keep the excitement up.
[b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5.0 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]TW[/b] has nice &quot;past&quot; and retro sci-fi art, but the decisions are fairly obvious.
[b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6.5 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]RA[/b] is actually a pretty good strategy game in which the die serves as an odd torture device:  One turn, you&#039;re begging for a big roll; the next, you want a 1.</comment>				</item>

[b]Kidnap and Rescue[/b] is a capture-the-flag game for 2-4 players.  Move to the captive, become the captive, and put your own pawn home.  Everyone else continues to try to get the captive, which is now you.  If someone catches you, they become the captive, and you re-enter from home.  Try to get the captive home!

[b]Spy Against Spy[/b] is another intentionally lopsided 2-player game, but this time the effect is a little more like American football.  The defender merely obstructs the offender as much as possible to minimize her progress over the course of ten turns.

[b]Runaway School Bus[/b] is a 1-player timed race, with the interesting twist that the timing is staged.  There are five points along the bus&#039;s path where you can intercept it.  You merely need to progress, by die roll of course, along your linear path more quickly than the bus to maximize your score.  This game features a small misprint, since if you don&#039;t count the picture of a schoolbus as a space for the bus, getting 5 points is quite literally impossible.  You can&#039;t get 14 out of two rolls of a six-sided die - it&#039;s low enough odds on three rolls.

[b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5.2 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]KaR[/b] would be a borefest were the movement not randomized by the die - though it certainly could be spiced up by having to choose movement cards or something.
[b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6.6 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]SAS[/b] is an interesting exercise in dodging defenses, or slowing offense, depending on which player you are.
[b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6.0 [/bgcolor][/b] [b]RSB[/b] offers you few decisions, but for some reason was addictive as a pastime.  If getting to the bus meant following a short path off the main trail, then the choices were tough and very risky!  Do you try to intercept the bus earlier for more points, trusting the die, or do you improve your odds of reaching the next intercept point in time by sacrificing a point?</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Excellent, and delightfully unusual.  You know, this is the way to use dice.  This game is more of a brain-burner than you&#039;d guess, because the way you hire people to get you dice, that get rolled, then used or hired out to secure positions of power, combat awful events, or otherwise wrangle for VP.  I wasn&#039;t completely sure how forcibly hiring each others&#039; workforces (dice) away from each other would work out; although it does shift play a little toward the tactical end of the spectrum, there is still plenty of strategy to employ.  It can be a little challenging to think your way through the complexities of playing well, which is a wonderful thing.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 8.03

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>This is a sick and rather strategic trick-taking game.  Take your tricks in the first three rounds very carefully:  You want all four suits and as many footprints as possible for maximum points, but you want as many of the next hand&#039;s trump as you can get, but you want the usual setup for a trick-taking hand of a missing suit so you can trump early and surprisingly.  You also want to be careful which tricks you take, because you only take enough tricks to form your next hand with the taken cards.  The fourth round scoring is absolutely different, and the tricks you may take are unlimited.  Instead of footprints × animalTypes, every bear you take is 4 points; every boar, 3; ram, 2; wolf, 1.  Just brilliant.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Production quality is excellent.  The game itself is about as basic as you can get:  Spin the spinner.  If it&#039;s rail (50% chance), and you can progress, move forward a space.  If it&#039;s the gate (25%), switch whose track is blocked at the midpoint.  If it&#039;s the bell (25%), ring the bell and yell for the sheer fun of doing so, really.  My not-quite-1½-year-olds&#039; eyes light up whenever we get this out, but they&#039;re just barely starting the get the notion of taking turns at anything.  The finer points of even a game like this are still a little beyond them, which was HABA&#039;s claim with the 2-year-old minimum.
1½ years:  They&#039;re getting better at taking turns, and even doing the right action for what they spun (with my instruction), though moving is rarely to the next space - not that I&#039;d expect it to be yet.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>43</numplays>			<comment>Each of the 21 coins represents one of the 21 unique combinations of two different numbers 1-7 on each side.  The coins are flipped and stacked into slots 1-7, to show what number you WON&#039;T get from that coin.  You select a coin, and flip it over, keeping that number.  You try to get all seven numbers to win.  This is an a suspenseful game.  Because you can get into a situation in which you can&#039;t win because all six of the number you need are taken, you must exercise a little strategy in addition to the gradual deduction.  If nobody gets their seven numbers, then you take turns turning one of your own coins over to try to get there.  I appreciate and like this more as I play it more!</comment>	<conditiontext>Home-made — My [b]5/6[/b] has gone missing!!!  :soblue:</conditiontext>	<wantpartslist>I need to make a new [b]5/6[/b] :soblue:</wantpartslist>		</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>As a 3-player game, with no one switching to Tuchulcha, it is just an unnecessarily more complex pachisi.  Getting Tuchulcha into the mix - and better still, Lasa Vecuvia, ought to increase the excitement level....

With 4 players, Tuchulcha in the game, followed by Lasa Vecuvia, then Tuchulcha eliminated, then someone else going Tuchulcha, it was a much more interesting game - even kind of fun!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>[b]Automa[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] The solitaire game is extremely basic (it&#039;s a deck of 24 cards), which means it&#039;s unobtrusive and welcoming to just set up and play. It also is set up to work automatically with whatever expansions you wish to include, which is nice. Does this mean it&#039;s easy to beat? Not necessarily: You have 7 years to win. So, while it doesn&#039;t excite me, it works well and serves its purpose. I just prefer playing against humans in this case. (Contrast this against [thing=39683][/thing], whose solitaire is so cool that playing with humans makes me itch to replay it solitaire!).

[person=62640][/person] pretty strongly recommends playing the game without any expansions, then adding Tier-1 expansions one at a time. Honestly, though, the Tier-1 expansions have such minuscule impact on the rules complexity that, if all your players are seasoned gamers, you could (and perhaps should) add them all at once when you move past playing the basic game.
:d6-1: [b]Mamas &amp; Papas[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] (complexity boost: 0) These add nice variation to people&#039;s starting assets, and will nudge them toward certain strategies ([i]Example: I started the game with a Wine Tasting Room, and nearly no cash, so I quickly started a habit of giving tours for lira and points.[/i]). However, you are welcome to buck the serving suggestion to a degree, by taking cash instead of the alternative.
:d6-1: [b]Property[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] 1. This makes your fields have differing capacities (5, 6, 7). 2. This gives you very interesting strategic options, not the least of which is scraping a few points out by flipping it back or forth when you have nothing better to do and the VP bonus space is available.
:d6-1: [b]Patronage[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] (complexity boost: 2%) It&#039;s nice to have an alternate &quot;known order&quot; to fill, right out of the gate, and the fact that doing this provides you with a secret 2-point endgame secret goal is good.
:d6-1: [b]Advanced Visitors[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] (complexity boost: 0) Mixed feelings on these.  I definitely like having more variety in visitors, but adding these without removing the equivalents broadens the quality spectrum on these quite a bit; however, removing them reduces the pool size again.  So, I guess I prefer them in there.
:d6-2: [b]New Visitors[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] More visitor variety is good, and the new ones seem exciting enough. [shrug]
:d6-2: [b]Extended Board[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] Aha!  The decisions are notably tougher now, and there are many more ways to replay this board than the basic one.  Nice!
:d6-2: [b]Special Workers[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] These rule-breaking meeples cost extra to train, but add another layer of consideration to your timing, placements, and exactly how you will gamble on getting the spots you need. …and because there is a Dominion-style greater pool from which a subset are selected for each game, it greatly enhances replayability.
:d6-2: [b]Structures[/b] [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] In effect, these are cards you can opt to take early on to guide your strategy, but unlike Mama and Papa, you&#039;re not stuck with them: You can fish for different ones. This is also good, because some become less (or more) useful over the course of the game, so you may wish to destroy and replace ones you&#039;ve built. I really like the variety of these, and they even outdo the Special Workers for what they infuse into the game.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>CRIPES, this has plenty of exceptions.  I think the game components could use some better naming and identification marks to show to what they correlate.  I do like, however, that there are really disparate ways to approach victory, so you can attempt whatever angle seems appropriate for your situation.  This game offers some good options, with a lot of downtime; the game&#039;s pleasure-to-length ratio is way too low for my tastes.  Our first game (2 newbs &amp; the owner of the game) took 6 hours with 3 players.  Yecch.  I was pleased to win sneakily, but could have played several games in that amount of time.  The second game, with everyone knowing how to play, took 5 hours.

The tech tree in the game is pretty silly for a 3- or 4-player game to 10 points; however, I imagine that in a 6-player and/or 14-point game, you can flex all the game&#039;s features.  ...but I wouldn&#039;t want to.  I spent probably 80% of those 5 hours of the second game actually watching a television show marathon, rather than engaged in the game.  Incidentally, I tied for the win on the second game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>2014-04-02: First impression:  Brutally difficult and utterly unforgiving system, but delightfully challenging.  The slap-each-other-around direct conflict feels a little too powerful for having so little ability to compensate (one change per turn, total, for both robots).

2014-04-03: Playing this real-time makes it much more satisfying.  I think it is a mistake for the 2p setup to have the bases straight from the middle.  Both 2p and 3p allow you to chain your two bots from the center, and just pass the crystals along to your base.  It&#039;s very satisfying to do, but chances are that if I am aligned to do this, you&#039;re scattered to the wind, and can&#039;t stop my well-oiled victory machine.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 6.50

All puzzle-race games are inherently biased toward the players whose minds excel in that area, but this is one of the more inclusive ones, since everyone&#039;s puzzle is different.  So, everyone gets to solve their very own puzzle each turn.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The difficulty jump from the three-piece side to the four-piece side is incredible, in some cases, but yay, this is fun!  It does away with the strategic element from its ancestor, which is mostly a good change.  (A sentence I still can&#039;t believe I wrote.)  It&#039;s a good change, because the strategic element of Ubongo always felt like an afterthought - a distraction from the blitz puzzle-solving action.  The replacement mechanism, however, can hand the victory to someone who is lucky at drawing from the bag - of course, they still have to be able to solve the puzzles, so the winner still has to have a modicum of qualification.  Nonetheless, plucking a gem or two after you&#039;ve solved your puzzle feels like a much more natural way to provide some statistically noisy scoring, and improves the game flow.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Wow, this gets fabulously convoluted, even compared to its little brother, [thing=136284][/thing].  You have 8 birds instead of 6.  The difficulty of the cards ranges from 1–5, instead of just 1–3.  Theoretically, you&#039;re supposed to use a sand timer, but you&#039;d need a judge; the game is too intense for any player to see that it&#039;s run out.  Also, depending on your players, li&#039;l brother&#039;s &quot;last player gets a countdown from 10&quot; rule seems much more friendly.

In any event, this game offers levels of handicapping, and total fun.  For how brutal speed puzzle games are, this modern game of seating everyone around the table according to their preferences is shockingly accessible… which makes me really happy, because I love it.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 8.00

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I like the various mechanisms Moon has in this game, and it provides a nice suspenseful choice each round of whether to invest your shares less efficiently than you could next turn, in order to have them should a scoring come up, or try to gain that efficiency.  Not to mention a little sneaky stock posturing, of course.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is a crossword game that manages to cut down on the downtime caused by the changing layout. Since you can overwrite other letters, your plans are rarely obliterated by the time your turn comes around. I prefer this to Scrabble and Wildwords (playing as individuals), though all are nice on occasion.  Wildwords in teams, on the other hand, is probably the best of the lot.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Interesting game with tricky choices.  Each turn, you need to decide how you want to implement your two previously-chosen actions (or the consolation actions if you can&#039;t use or don&#039;t like what your options), and then choose an unoccupied tile for which you will switch the current one.  In so doing, you not only speculatively choose your two actions for next turn, you also change the landscape for you and your opponents.  This leads to wonderfully difficult decisions.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Once you discard any expectations of what sort of game mechanisms something called &quot;Vampire&quot; might employ, this totally abstract game is actually good fun.  Vying for the best collection of vampire heads from a certain locale is made a little more tricky by not only the fact that once you display a collection, the only way you can &quot;improve&quot; it is by replacing it, but also by the foreboding awareness that the game could end easily - and perhaps spitefully - by someone having collections of vampire heads from each locale.  While I was initially disappointed (due to expectations, those ever-sinful notions), replays have really warmed me to this game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The 7th and 8th players are certainly welcome (as are white and purple).  The Verflixxt tiles are terrifying, but may add more chaos than some would prefer.  The worm tiles are brilliant.  Both of the latter two give players strategic reasons to [b]choose[/b] to take negative tiles.  I&#039;m quite pleased with the first expansion!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Insidious!  It looks like a [gameid=320] knockoff, but it really isn&#039;t - which is very surprising for a word game from 1976.  On your turn, you form as many words as you can, then leave the board for your opponent to try to convert letters and words.  Any word whose root she can alter by appending to it or changing one letter, any letter she uses in her word, and any crossed words tweaked (you&#039;re allowed to change one extra letter in one of the two crossed words), convert to her color.  If you can&#039;t end your turn with more letters in your color than in your opponent&#039;s, you lose.  It&#039;s the most cutthroat word game I&#039;ve ever played!  [gameid=4268] is quite the fast-pace tug-of-war, but Vice Versa is nasty, as you pointedly try to convert letters to your color and lock them permanently into that state!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>25</numplays>			<comment>2009-11: Tentative rating of a prototype:  [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b]  Hidden amongst the tannins are hints of [gameid=555] and [gameid=12188], with a nice bite of mechanisms that punish you slightly for letting someone else do what you want before you get to it.  All of this lingers nicely as you hedge your bets as to the best way to maximize your score while remaining solvent and capable of racking up more points.  [thing=42052]Vinícola[/thing] has not only a gorgeous color, but complex flavors to keep the connoisseur interested from cork to finish.

2010-12-02: Tentative rating of published game: [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] [thing=42052]Vinhos[/thing] has a lot in common with [thing=42052]Vinícola[/thing]; however they differ quite a lot, and play quite differently.  The published game is even more challenging, and leaves me strategizing after the game is over, anxious for another go.  The core of the game is the same, but there are some new aspects that provide interesting options.  For example, with Vinícola, the years before fairs were 3-3-3; in Vinhos, it&#039;s 3-2-1.  That means Vinícola gave players 18 actions over the course of the game; Vinhos, 12... [b]plus[/b] bonus actions through calling in favors with the Managers.  So you could have many more actions, if you jockey it well.  Money is even tighter in Vinhos than in Vinícola; however, due to the separation of balance and interest, you can pull some very interesting stunts at the bank, now.  There is much, much to explore in Vinhos before I can even pretend to be the wine game connoisseur I want to be....

2010-12-05: [b][bgcolor=#00cc00] 10 [/bgcolor][/b] As I&#039;m starting to get plays under my belt (and adapt to the new incarnation of a favored game), I can proclaim that this is a fantastic game!  I&#039;m hooked, and I haven&#039;t even popped the cork on the Vinho Verde in the basement to have with the game yet!</comment>	<conditiontext>Prototype, color laser printed.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Wow, this game is tricky, vicious, and cool, and it is really standing the test of time - or so I say November 2006.  Advice:  Use the little punch-out circles from the grape-holding wine cellar cards as six feet for those cards.  With the added height, the grapes are held off the table, and much more stably.  I&#039;ve even considered permanently affixing them to the cards, if I could just bring myself to defile the sanctity of a game well made.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I think this is a good game, and while the die can be torturous, its swing is only ±1 (0: 50%; +1: 33%; -1: 17%).  Optimize your strategy accordingly.  There are nice, torturous mechanisms for worker placement, and a few interesting outs when you are otherwise hosed.  Unfortunately, it can [b]feel[/b] like the winner is determined by the die, but the reality is that it&#039;s a game that lets you think that there&#039;s only one way to approach it; however, there are strategies lurking under the surface….</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.00

	<numplays>19</numplays>			<comment>[b][thing=128621]Viticulture[/thing][/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] The improvements made in the second edition are sound and good.  …especially because the &quot;no wasting the bonus space unless you have to&quot; rule was kept as a variant. It&#039;s certainly a rule that would depend on the the players&#039; preferences.

[b][thing=147101]Tuscany[/thing]:[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b]
[b]Automa[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] The solitaire game is extremely basic (it&#039;s a deck of 24 cards), which means it&#039;s unobtrusive and welcoming to just set up and play. It also is set up to work automatically with whatever expansions you wish to include, which is nice. Does this mean it&#039;s easy to beat? Not necessarily: You have 7 years to win. So, while it doesn&#039;t excite me, it works well and serves its purpose. I just prefer playing against humans in this case. (Contrast this against [thing=39683][/thing], whose solitaire is so cool that playing with humans makes me itch to replay it solitaire!).

[person=62640][/person] pretty strongly recommends playing the game without any expansions, then adding Tier-1 expansions one at a time. Honestly, though, the Tier-1 expansions have such minuscule impact on the rules complexity that, if all your players are seasoned gamers, you could (and perhaps should) add them all at once when you move past playing the basic game.
:d6-1: [b]Mamas &amp; Papas[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] (complexity boost: 0) These add nice variation to people&#039;s starting assets, and will nudge them toward certain strategies ([i]Example: I started the game with a Wine Tasting Room, and nearly no cash, so I quickly started a habit of giving tours for lira and points.[/i]). However, you are welcome to buck the serving suggestion to a degree, by taking cash instead of the alternative.
:d6-1: [b]Property[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] 1. This makes your fields have differing capacities (5, 6, 7). 2. This gives you very interesting strategic options, not the least of which is scraping a few points out by flipping it back or forth when you have nothing better to do and the VP bonus space is available.
:d6-1: [b]Patronage[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] (complexity boost: 2%) It&#039;s nice to have an alternate &quot;known order&quot; to fill, right out of the gate, and the fact that doing this provides you with a secret 2-point endgame secret goal is good.
:d6-1: [b]Advanced Visitors[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] (complexity boost: 0) Mixed feelings on these.  I definitely like having more variety in visitors, but adding these without removing the equivalents broadens the quality spectrum on these quite a bit; however, removing them reduces the pool size again.  So, I guess I prefer them in there.
:d6-2: [b]New Visitors[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] More visitor variety is good, and the new ones seem exciting enough. [shrug]
:d6-2: [b]Extended Board[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] Aha!  The decisions are notably tougher now, and there are many more ways to replay this board than the basic one.  Nice!
:d6-2: [b]Special Workers[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] These rule-breaking meeples cost extra to train, but add another layer of consideration to your timing, placements, and exactly how you will gamble on getting the spots you need. …and because there is a Dominion-style greater pool from which a subset are selected for each game, it greatly enhances replayability.
:d6-2: [b]Structures[/b] [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] In effect, these are cards you can opt to take early on to guide your strategy, but unlike Mama and Papa, you&#039;re not stuck with them: You can fish for different ones. This is also good, because some become less (or more) useful over the course of the game, so you may wish to destroy and replace ones you&#039;ve built. I really like the variety of these, and they even outdo the Special Workers for what they infuse into the game.
:d6-3: [b]Mafia[/b] [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b] This was a lot better than I expected, because it just sounded silly. It is still moderately silly, and not what I would consider a Tier-3 expansion: Tier-1 dispensable expansion.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is a magnificent game.  It does something that is difficult for abstract games to do:  Gives you a feeling like no other.  As with [thing=124265][/thing], the goal is to unify your pieces; however, UNITY&#039;s board starts full, and you unify your pieces at any cost, destroying pieces at least as often as you move them (itself, pure genius).  In Volo, the board starts nearly empty, and your &quot;birds&quot; (pieces) are not destructive.  In fact, they won&#039;t even move unless moving increases the size of their flock.  This element makes the gameplay very, very interesting, because accomplishing your goal requires a fresh mode of thought, as does obstructing your opponent.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>:) This is an interesting, and unusual card game!  You try to get your candidate into office by the delightfully distilled technique of getting the most political posters up first.  First, you look at the viable locations.  Next, you speculate which poster you will be able to stick up, or hedge your bets, and plan for several possibilities.  Select just the right worker(s) from your hand to be able to do the job.  By contributing more to the workforce, you will get your pick of the workers, but by contributing fewer, you can reserve certain workers for later.  If you contributed, you will get one new worker; if not, you have time to recruit two.  Once everyone&#039;s made this tributary bid, the pecking order for the turn is established, and in that order, each player drafts a worker for the turn.  Next, in turn order, each player posts her propaganda — if it fits anywhere!  (This is a polite political contest:  Nobody plasters their posters over others&#039;.)  Repeat this process until either someone has posted all her posters, or there&#039;s nowhere left to post anything.  Whoever has the smallest area of unposted material wins!

A couple of things diminished our enjoyment of the first playing:  The first of which is that we discovered that the yellow candidate&#039;s poster deck had two duplicate difficult cards, instead of two very easy cards.  Fortunately, there were only five of us, so yellow switched to black, and we played (after verifying that we all had identical distributions of posters).  This bring me to a second strange issue:  The box says it&#039;s for 2-4 players, but the rules clearly expect 3-6 — and the component corroborate that.  A small but strange production mistake.  My final issues all pertain to the generally good instructions, which are translated fairly well into English.  There are minor exceptions, such as translating [i]preferencia[/i] to [i]reference[/i] — perhaps just a typo — but it is also one of the examples of some wording that I think is less than ideally clear in both languages anyway.  The ones that really bother me are the ambiguous ones that, once we had played, we were sure that we had misinterpreted:

:( In a minor layout mistake, in the Setup for both languages, the images of Location and Worker cards are aligned with the other&#039;s text.  That&#039;s easy enough to figure out.

:soblue: &quot;Each round some Location Cards will be put into play. [...] The amounts of Location Cards that are turned over depend on the number of players: [2 or 3]  The Starting Player takes the appropriate number of Location Cards and places them in the middle of the table.&quot;
&quot;Cada ronda se descubren cartas en las que aparecen Ubicaciones que tienen espacios marcados para colocar la propoganda[....]  La cantidad de Cartas de Ubicación descubiertas dependerá de la cantidad de jugadores: [2 o 3]  El Jugador Inicial toma la cantidad de cartas que corresponda y las coloca al centro de la mesa.&quot;
It seems perfectly clear on the first turn, but as you come back to Phase 1 on the second turn, you now likely have leftover locations.  From the wording, we leaned toward drawing the full three location cards each time.  As the game drew to a close and it was not even theoretically possible for anyone to have played all their cards (I think we had 5 or 6 rounds before the locations ran out), we became confident that we should have replenished the locations to three, if there were fewer.  I realize now, however, that doing that could lead to a situation in which nobody can play on any of the locations, if people played their small posters early, and nobody has anything that fits on the locations.  Unfortunately, there&#039;s not a component list, so perhaps there should have been fewer workers and more locations.

:( It is never explicitly stated that you can only stick up a poster with the worker you draft from the turn&#039;s workforce, but it seemed like this was the only way it would be interestingly difficult.

:( &quot;All Workers Cards used in this Phase are discarded.&quot;  &quot;Todas las Cartas de Trabajador utilizadas en esta Fase se descartan.&quot;  Because this is all that is said on the matter, we decided that all workers drafted are discarded at the end of the phase, regardless of whether they could be used.  Inability to use the worker you drafted is not addressed explicitly/clearly.

:( &quot;When during Phase 5 a player manages to place his last poster, the game will end immediately. [...] When during Phase 1 there are not enough cards on the Location Deck to fill the Locations in the middle of the table, the game will be over.&quot;  In the first case, it says [i]immediately[/i], but in the second that isn&#039;t specified.  Especially because we&#039;d only had five rounds (with five players), we decided to play the round out — by this point, we were keenly aware that we had to make rulings, and even people besides me were looking at the Spanish rules to verify that it&#039;s nearly verbatim like the rest: &quot;Cuando durante la Fase 5 un jugador coloque su &quot;último cartel el juego terminará de inmediato[....] Cuando durante la Fase 1 no haya suficientes Cartas de Ubicación en el mazo para rellenar las Ubicaciones al centro de la mesa, entonces el juego habrá terminado.&quot;

:) Although these complaints (especially my doubts about having the correct card distribution) may sound grave, I thought this was a very cool, innovative card game.  I was surprised by how fresh it felt, and the clever flow of bidding providing a drafting pool.  I also really liked the harsh tradeoff of bidding high enough to get what you want and when, and conserving cards — and the right ones — to play your posters successfully.  Despite the clever, skillful caricatures of Ketty &amp; Co. for the political posters, I didn&#039;t think a political voting game would appeal to me.  I was quite wrong.  I itch to be sure I have the right components, so I can introduce people to this cleverly designed, quick game.

:robot: [company=7585][/company], please provide component lists for all your games!  People need to be able to know if they don&#039;t have the right parts for their game.  ...and please check the contents before sending them out the door.  I know I had wrong distributions of cards in two [company=7585][/company], so now I doubt them all.  I shall inventory all five of my [company=7585][/company], and then beg for replacements.

:thumbsup: Otherwise, the production quality is very good, with linen finish cards and box — sturdy box.  The illustrations are colorful and well done, and the instructions have a very professional look to them.  With some rules clarifications, and content controls, I enthusiastically recommend this innovative game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The quick timer increases the intensity as you have to lift each disc higher and higher.  Nonetheless, there comes a point when no amount of speed or strategy will save you, when all of your lower discs are crucial to the support of the tower.  Basically all the &quot;choices&quot; are obvious, and then the game is over when there&#039;s nothing further you can do about it.  ...unless someone actually knocks the tower over, or moves too slowly to grab the marble.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>2007-06-13: This is a brilliantly designed trick-taking game.  First, everyone drafts their 5 tasks they must complete for victory.  Then the game begins.  The dealer is the only one who knows the trump number and color (if there are any) before the Rochester card draft begins.  He must announce after each trick&#039;s worth of cards is taken which drafted card would have won that trick, giving the other players the opportunity to deduce what trumps are.  After all the cards are drafted, the trumps are revealed - though by then, it is usually not a surprise.  Then everyone but the dealer selects a task to complete - the dealer has to complete someone else&#039;s task, without that player also completing the task.  So, the dealer has the most control over how trumpy his drafted cards are, but zero control over his goal - psychological trickery aside, of course.  Then the tricks are played out.  Oh, the balance!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A severe rules misinterpretation at the very beginning of the game hampered my experience a bit, but everything thereafter was according to the rules.  Z-Man&#039;s components are great, but the game itself didn&#039;t quite thrill me.  My biggest gripe is that the people who get the handy special action cards just keep winning more, while those with nothing useful just keep failing more.  I think the wasabi cards are probably a key aspect, and if you don&#039;t feel like confrontationally blocking people&#039;s builds with them, they will just walk all over your game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>I first played [thing=66712][/thing] 4p, which I do not think is an optimal starting point. I believe the game will feel much different 4p when all four players already grasp the game.  The big, fat dewdrops are an excellent option to divide up the playfield, and add challenge to your maneuvering.

This is a superb, thinky, but accessible 3- and 4-player game. A big hit with the family!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>NULL</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>First off:  This is way more fun in teams!  You can tell your partner your insidious plan that you can&#039;t work out, and she can give you something that fits it, and vice versa.  Ah, the satisfaction of playing F*Q*Y, and getting a unanimous challenge from every opponent.  (FreQuencY was the play :^)

WildWords is a clever revamping of Scrabble.  WildWords adds four penalty spaces to the board, as well as wildcard tiles, and wildcard-forcing spaces.  All of these allow the player much more freedom in building words, introducing more lateral thinking than simply playing a mental game of Anagrams each turn to figure out what plays are valid.

My favorite play so far was by a pleasantly obnoxious player who was stuck with a tray full of asterisk tiles.  He opted to blow them all to get the bonus for playing all his tiles in one turn, and placed them, with his one letter, on the board to form one long word - full of asterisks - and plenty of crosswords.  Hilarious!

If you love Scrabble, then you can be veritably assured that you&#039;ll love WildWords - unless, like my mother, you don&#039;t like to play the blank tiles in Scrabble.  WildWords is delightfully inexpensive, so buy it for yourself or a Scrabble-lover you know.

Lateral thinking is good for you!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>An interesting solitaire, in that often offers strategic choices:  Every time a pair of cards is compatible for movement, you have to decide which pile of face-up cards is moving onto the other.  Obviously, you want to do this in ways that maximizes your future plays, but you have to gamble as to what cards will turn up below.  Window is also a brutal solitaire.  The first time I played, there was literally one play I could make (in my choice of two directions, of course) before the board was locked up.  The next play, I was dead on the deal.  The third play, I got to make a lot of plays before I was dead, but I still had 14/36 cards face-down - far from done.  Sadly, Window makes no use of the suits, which is part of what makes it brutal:  You have six aces and six crowns, but only three of any other card.  Unable to move due to suit matches, the board can be deadlocked quite quickly.  Still, the ability to move stacks around as you empty spaces makes the game more interesting.  Late in the game, you can even get some sliding-puzzle action as you try to squeeze just a few more joins out....</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>It was a lot more fun than I&#039;d guess for a member of the greater blind role selection family, mainly because players after the lead player can choose to piggy-back safely, rather than steal the privilege and risk all.  Not bad!

Furthermore, this is improved by the 3 expansions in [thing=40688][/thing].  (One just adds a 6th player and some play-easing components, but the second adds amulets that decrease the forgone conclusions at the end of each role played, and the third adds a draft of a special ability for each round.)</comment>				<wishlistcomment>mine:	 6.50

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s not too thrilling with few players, since the answers are few, and the odds give weak payouts.  With more players, the swing of the odds is greater.  I think increasing the bet regulator on turns 1 through 6 should increase the excitement.  Still, great concept!

Update:  As expected, a seven-player game is a lot of fun!

I think that with fewer than seven players, players should take turns giving bonus answers not in their color - in other words, no credit for having the &quot;right&quot; answer.  It would keep the payouts more interesting.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>For whatever reason, this game always half-heartedly called to me, but I&#039;ve finally played it.  The two-sided tiles provide plenty of options, as well as strange hand-management challenges, as you attempt to maximize a flock in your color.  Covertly.  Until it&#039;s advantageous to blow your cover.  Good stuff.  Asmodée&#039;s edition has nicely laminated, very colorful tiles that really do justice to the charming graphics.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Group lateral thinking can be really fun at times, but Word Blur mostly just frustrates me.  Imagine playing charades, except you can&#039;t improvise.  Instead, you have to scan 900 little tiles for words you could use to guide your team to the correct answer.  It&#039;s just as &quot;fun&quot; when the roles are reversed.  Most of the other people with whom I&#039;ve played it really seemed to enjoy it, and there was always plenty of energy in the room; however, it just kind of irritated me.  It was like trying to carry on a conversation when all you have is a 900-word vocabulary, with a really poor memory retrieval system.  Not for me.

Finally!  I played this with a group that made this less agonizing for me.  I actually had fun.  Yes, the frustrations were still there, but there was better mental networking between the teams&#039; players.  I&#039;m glad to get to enjoy this game some, but its very heavy dependence on well-paired teammates has me ever wary of playing it, unless coerced - or that same group of people again, perhaps.  :^)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a willy-nilly wordsearch game fused with a connection game:  On your turn, find a word by whatever willy-nilly connections (orthogonal and/or diagonal), then mark it with your discs.  You are trying to connect any two opposite sides of the playfield in order to win.  It takes about ten minutes to play (analysis paralysis notwithstanding), and is moderately fun.  Its connection nature causes it to have [thing=949][/thing]-like strategy, but because the pieces you put down depend entirely on the words you can find, it has a much more trivial feel.  The longer the word, the better, because you irrevocably clutter the playfield with your claimed property.  This should make a good family game, with the replay value boosted by the configurable playfield.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A fun, but clunky speed game.  What makes this clunky is that there are two modes, and the play alternates between the modes.  Each mode has a totally different procedure - and they are procedures - you must follow.  I think a few plays within a week would get everyone comfortable with the procedures, and just let the game shine, however.  Andrea made very clever use of the off-language cards, such that this is an English/German release that uses all the cards whichever way you play.  I certainly would like to play this some more!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Nice, distilled hybrid of [gameid=181] and [gameid=483], with a nice, minimalistic selection of rules and techniques from each in order to provide a 15 to 30 minute game that preserves the essence of the territorial maneuvering.  [gameid=39565]:[gameid=181]/[gameid=483]::[gameid=21346]:[gameid=2397]  You get the invasion intent indicators of [gameid=483] and the new editions of [gameid=181] by pointing the pyramids.  You get the dice-based combat of [gameid=181], weighted by troop strength (a little [gameid=483] spin on the die rolling).  You get the unit displacement from victory as in [gameid=483], and a [gameid=39565] take on elimination of cornered units:  Instead, they&#039;re reduced, which could still result in elimination.  You have an elegant, tense victory condition:  You win by controlling as few as four territories on a map of 18 territories (specifically, you must control all 3 territories of a foreign continent, plus at least one of your home territories).  As you can see from my ratings, I like [gameid=39565] a little more than [gameid=181] and [gameid=483].  Andrew elegantly met his design goal with this one.  Plus, the little, properly mounted board is as small as it could possibly be, and fairly nice.  Nicer still, Looney Labs provided their mailing list with free, folded paper versions of the game that are the same size.</comment>	<conditiontext>paper promotional version</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is a very nice, fast-paced game filled with torturous decisions.  It is also packed with replay value, since only about half the event cards are in each game, and they will determine which projects are available during the game, and how the plague spreads and plays out.  The event card mechanism is a brilliant innovation, providing instantaneous or chronic effects, determining who catches the plague, and then based on the orientation chosen by the active player, granting an income of sorts for all the players, and a specific favor (or misfortune) for the active player.  All with one square card, that is very easy to understand, and its orientation to movement spots on the board.</comment>				</item>

Oh, and there&#039;s no trading.  If you like a little playful spite in your games, this would probably be a [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] or better for you.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The main problem with this light, family, stab-your-opponents game is the graphic design.  There are all these fun [-]critters[/-] sorcerers, but there are basically no player-assisting graphics whatsoever.

For example, each element is disallowed from being situated &quot;above&quot; one other element.  Why, then, do the tiles not indicate this?  Instead, you constantly refer to a summary card to keep track of it, and 20 minutes later notice that each player has several illegal plays.  Dysfunctional.

Another example:  Each player has one of each of the 8 super-effects.  This is represented with an icon on the tile — a completely meaningless icon, instead of one suggestive of the effect.

It&#039;s too bad.  It probably knocks two points off this game&#039;s score, because it hampers gameplay so much.  Technically, the first gripe about no illegal play hints renders the game broken and unplayable, but if all players work really hard at it, you [b]might[/b] be able to keep abreast of this rule.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 6.00

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A pleasant periodic way to spend 15 minutes.  Though the theme is so very irrelevant that the instructions give up on it before they&#039;re even through the introduction, it does give the players some colorful artwork, rather than bland cards.  At times, you will be tossed by the waves of whatever cards you draw, but even so, wise choices of what to play when, as well as some good prediction / card counting reveal the tactics of the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Nice abstract strategy game.  Unfortunately, with purely strategic games with a lot of depth for analytical planning of your moves, I just don&#039;t care enough to (and perhaps can&#039;t) plot 23 turns ahead.  So, such games I play mostly tactically.  Fortunately, Yinsh feels like its strategic depth may still be safe for novice swimmers like me.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>As I caught myself saying in response to [person=6046]Ted[/person]&#039;s humble suggestion that we play this game, I am a sucker for trick-taking games.  The fact that this game is only three rounds long is perfect, because (unless you hate it somehow, or trick-taking isn&#039;t in your blood) it leaves you hungry for seconds.  I really enjoyed this unorthodox take on trick-taking.  There are only a few other games I&#039;ve played that sport this multiple simultaneous tricks / hands concept, and this one requires a smidgen more trust in your opponents not playing a non-led color on a tick, when they still have that color in their hand — or a lot of reminding.  Still, You Suck definitely does not suck.  It is well worth adding to your collection of strange trick-taking games.

[b]Caylus Magna Carta: The Favors[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] — This adds some nice elements to the game, but lengthens the game to the length of Caylus.

[b]Metropolys[/b] goal cards [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] — I enjoyed them just fine, as I scored 18 points off mine, and my opponents got zero.  So, they might be a little skewing.  Still, they add no complexity to the game; only to your choices, which is a win in my book.

[b]Mykerinos: The Nile[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] — Adds some interesting carvings to the areas and game, but I&#039;m not convinced that Greenwish is much more than a distraction.

[b]Sylla: caveant consules[/b] TBD

[b]Yspahan: The Souks[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] — The slight rules tweaks and replacement set of cards balance the game a little more, and reign the Caravansary in a bit, to make it a viable strategy, without needing to be fought by the other players.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.5+:	 7.20

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The concept of Zendo is not unlike a number of party games; however, with the visuals of the Icehouse pieces, it becomes an addiction.  I want to play it now.  The only fault I can find with this game so far is that it simultaneously wants to be competetive and cooperative, so the players feel a little weird about guessing and so forth, because everyone wants to be the one to solve the master&#039;s riddle.  This is the most singular game for Icehouse pieces I&#039;ve tried.  Excellent.  If you don&#039;t already have Icehouse pieces, get this.  If you do, then play it, or even consider increasing your collection of Icehouse pieces and supporting Looney Labs some more.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>Brilliant abstract strategy game, which operates off checkers&#039;/draughts&#039; strategic linchpin of forced captures.  Since the strategy is significantly deeper than with checkers, much clever planning is required; and in order to excel at ZÈRTZ, you must be able to analyze the current situation and derive numerous branches of future possibilities from it, as with any moderately deep, purely strategic game.  Brilliant stuff, though.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I think the key to making this game fun is forcing people to play each card in 1 second or less.  Unfortunately, some of the various god cards look just sufficiently similar at a glance, that you kind of have to read them to be sure what they do.  Nonetheless, it&#039;s a pointedly goofy slugfest to 100 points, by way of explicitly setting the number to 50 or 99, or rounding it, or reversing its digits.  There are even player-skipping cards whose only real use are to procrastinate giving someone the 100-point finish line.</comment>				</item>

It also means losing a key piece is doubly dangerous.  The ability for nearly every piece to promote, though usually to a piece that can only move one space, is also key to making this a very fun chess to play.&quot;  With [boardgameversion=135734]Dobutsu Shogi in the Greenwood[/boardgameversion], there is utterly cute art on the pieces, but more importantly, the moves are clearly depicted on the pieces in a way that is also aesthetically pleasing.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 7.00

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The fact that many of the pieces are restricted to their side of the river, or even to their palace, makes this a very interesting chess to play.  Additionally, the cannon&#039;s jump-precisely-one-piece-to-capture attack presents interesting tactics both for attack and for defense.  Did I mention that both players start the game with pieces threatened?  Even to a beginner, the first move can&#039;t seem unimportant.  :^)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The differences from [thing=2136]Pachisi[/thing] are fascinating, but all in all, they just make the game more brutal.  Rolling 6 thrice in a row sends [b]all[/b] your planes in flight back to the hangar?!?  Stacking your pieces neither protects them nor blocks the path; instead, they can all be sent back to the hangar when an opposing plane hits them.  Obviously, you will avoid that situation, which does add some risk management to the game.  Pleasantly different, but still not a great thrill, and it drags on, as you&#039;d expect.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>0.6+:	 4.00
