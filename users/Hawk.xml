Although the game takes a long time to complete, it is not a &quot;long&quot; game, as there is always something for you to do, like planning out your next move, or which stocks you will be buying/selling, not to mention budgeting for that next train upgrade.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>How difficult is it to make a player aid??  This one is screaming for one.  Had to keep referring to the manual to understand the iconography.

Probably required a few plays to understand the mechanic, but found there was too much luck.  If the cards you need don&#039;t come up, you will go through the motion but still finish in last place.  Will you have fun playing?  If you like going back to the rulebook to check the icons from the cards, sure, but I&#039;ll pass.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Only played one game, and the point spread was rather large...  Mechanics seem a bit odd, especially the armies, which appear Ã -la [thing=224][/thing], except the armies disappear at the end of every turn...  Felt more like a sub-game, although this IS how one scores VPs prior to turn 5.

The dice combat system seemed useless and adds randomness in order to force players to expend resources.

Will probably be replaying this again, to see if we did something wrong, as this one really did not impress me (which usually means it will not be played again).

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This one is difficult to rate, as it appears to be a good game at first glace.  It has interesting mechanics, worker placement, research, resource collecting and hand management.

However, it appears to drag.  The combat system is rather complex for a card game.  Suggestions of using a pen and paper to track resources indicates, to me, that play testing was limited, as a simple grid and 4 resource counters would suffice to track this.

Not so with the military units, which may contain from 1 to 5 &quot;units&quot;, therefore we used a die for this (who doesn&#039;t have a bucket of dice?).

Be ready to spend several hours for your first game, just to understand the basic concept.  If you can weather that, then I am sure you will be able to find an interesting game in here, as you are able to customize your deck.

The sad thing is that this one had great potential, but there are better card games of this type out there who currently do a better job.  Still, with the right card mix and clearer rules, this one could have been good.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I was surprised by this one, as you have to make difficult choices most of the time.  All the mechanics appear to work well together, and they fit the theme.

There are multiple ways to win, and adapting your plan to maximize you every action is key.

The game board, counters and cards are nice.  The miniatures look good but are a tad too colorful (some people will have trouble with the green and blue).  The coins are simply awesome!!

On the down side, the point track around the board could have been done much better.  Why not stop at 100 points and have bigger and wider areas?  As it is, you&#039;re better to go to paper, which is too bad.

Would have rated this one a &#039;8.5&#039;, but the small and narrow point track drops it to an &#039;8&#039;.

Says on the back of the box that it&#039;s &quot;Expandable to six players&quot;...  So when will the 6th player expansion come out?</comment>		<wantpartslist>Looking for any/all parts for AoE III</wantpartslist>		</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Where&#039;s the game?  You don&#039;t know what your objectives are until 3/4 of the game is over.  Each turn you select a source and a target, roll a die and hope for 3 or more to win...  Oh yeah, one of the actions you did previously probably helped someone who just found out his/her objective was to grow that race.  Since you don&#039;t know what your objectives are, it is rather difficult to block someone else from achieving his/her objective as he/she don&#039;t know what it is either.  A waste of 2 hours of your life.

Got rid of this stinker.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I enjoyed the Permanent/Random deck mechanic as well as the nice components, and the interesting resource system.

The combat system has unfortunately soured my experience with this game.

IMHO, they would have been better off with a system similar to Axis &amp; Allies, as I cannot understand how 1 or 2 units can wipe out an opposing army of 6 units, repeatedly.  This is not to mention that the players not engaged in the battle have nothing to do until the end of combat, which can last 5-10 minutes, as combat is conducted 1 unit at a time.

This approach provides an unfair advantage to better units, as it removes the possibility of overwhelming them with cheaper units (i.e. there can be no strenght in numbers with this system).

Last but not least, I&#039;m not interested in playing Rock-Paper-Scisors for 2 hours.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A good civilization building game, but it will probably be too long for many.  Learning curve may be steep at first, so expect 1-2 games just to get a good grasp of what you need to do (and when).  The Misery track can be quite problematic when you don&#039;t know which event(s) will send you plummeting down...

Combat system requires a dice roll, which some purists may not like, and even though I lost countless battles, it did not bother me (I prefer this to knowing in advance that my attack will be successful, as it removes some of the analysis-paralysis as players try to maximize everything).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Finally got to play my first game with the correct rules!  Nice components, and although I like economic games, this one simply did not work for me, as I found myself playing last way too often (6 turns out of 8!).  Not being able to afford to stay in the bidding race essentially meant that the game was already over, as the only available options would not help me catch up with the leaders.  Would work better if it used a system such as POWER GRID, where the last player gets to choose first.

Do note that I played with experienced players, and we had a runaway leader.  By turn 4 the game was already decided, so the last hour+ was pointless.  The bidding for the turn order killed it for me, and the randomness of the goods draw did not help.  Rating reflects the fact that I am not interested in playing this again.  If you have the 12 hours or more needed to learn to become more competitive, then perhaps this game could be of interest to you.  For me, there are too many better alternatives.  The lengthier 18xx games are, in my opinion, clearly better.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Talk about limited actions and the desire to do more.  Not for the faint of heart as the game will usually be a solid 2-3 hours.  Not to be played with folks who suffer from Analysis-Paralysis!

In this one you need to find the right combos which will yield you the best results.  The cards passed at the start of the game ensure good replay value, but I found they limited your options.  Then again, it forces everyone to adopt different strategies.

Played twice with 5-players and did not enjoy the experience.  The initial card handout will provide some players with an advantage.  Game is probably best with 4, as it is too tight with 5.  Was unable to get my strategy going due to the options being very limited.  Game ended with the leaders essentially doubling three of the five players!  36-34-21-20-20.

Play with 4 and it was much better.  Raised my rating, and am looking forward to trying it again, with 4.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is a good WWI air combat game, in 2D.  Although simplistic, there are still a lot of strategies possible.

&quot;Canvas Eagles&quot;, which is based on this game, adds altitude and flight constraints, which makes the game more appealing to those who prefer 3 dimensional air combat.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is an OK game.  I&#039;ve played with up to 6 players and find the sweet spot is 4.  Anything above 4 and it becomes rather chaotic (can&#039;t really plan ahead), and less than 4 is good if all the players are relatively at the same level of experience (else the point spread will turn you away from this game).

Rating dropped from 7 to 6 following a 3 player game which ended with a 60 point spread between the 2nd and 3rd player...  I prefer games which are closer, where the last player has a chance to gain ground.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>After reading the rules, thought it was similar to KINGSBURG, but this is NOT the case, as rolling higher numbers does not ensure you get better resources.

As player dice STAY ON THE BOARD between turns, it is possible to partially block, or affect the &quot;cost&quot; of playing a certain action.

Since what you rolled limits your available choices of actions, it makes it difficult to plan ahead, as all you can do is choose a general direction and hope things don&#039;t change too much until your turn comes around again.

Still, it is next to impossible to be blocked, as there are tech cards which have various powers that you can use, which allows you to bend certain rules, modify the die results, re-roll, etc.

I like the fact that you can make the game longer by playing with 8 Colony tokens per players.  My group found 6 tokens was just a bit too long, but after a few more plays, it should clock in the listed time.

Further, there is a 5th player expansion, which I may not pick up as it would make the game too long.  But the option will be there for those who prefer 5-player games and/or have more time to play.

All in all, a nice design which leaves enough decision making, where players are not cornered, but where there is still a good deal of luck (die rolling).  As I mentioned, this can be mitigated with the right cards and card combos!

The area majority on the planet, which gives you points and a special card/power if you have a majority, is simple, and seems to work fine.

The only negative aspect is the rulebook, which is missing a few important cross-references, and where some of the important rules should have been listed in bold and/or highlighted, so they could be easily referenced.

As an example, where it says that your dice stay on the table between turns, perhaps a little highlighting might have shown this to be a key rule of the game.

The Data Crystal exception regarding the Burroughs Desert should also have been listed under the Burroughs Desert section, else people would think that the Alien die will keep changing hands.  Actually, this puts more importance on the territory at the center of the board, where I would expect folks try to prevent a majority.

Looking forward to trying this again, now that we seem to have figured out all the fiddly details we missed on our first go.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is a faily straight forward game.  I like the part where one needs to accomplish 3 out of 5 objectives in order to win.  On the down side, there is little player interaction, and one cannot prevent another player from building his settlers/pioneers/townsfolks/merchants, not any other objective for that matter.

The resource cards could have been replaced by cubes instead, as they would have been easier to pick up (they could be hidden in your hand).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Multiple paths to victory.  The wheel mechanic makes for very quick turns, and provides the players with good control over their own destiny.  Next to no down time when playing with 4 players!  Components are of excellent quality, and I really liked the starting position/Cities cards and player aids.

The technology grid is easy to play with, and does not confer an unfair advantage to the first person to develop it (although they do get the personality card, i.e. 1VP).

Game plays faster than MARE NOSTRUM, excludes exchanges, and does not suffer as badly from leader bashing.  I would prefer randomized combat, but I found the 1:1 exchanges worked surprisingly well.

Game is a tad pricey at 51 euros, but well worth the investment as it will see a lot of table time.  Recommended!</comment>	<conditiontext>MINT - in original shrink wrap</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I was happily surprise by this one.  Yes, it&#039;s another &quot;deck building&quot; type game, but this one is bare bones, and works remarkably well.

Only played one game, which ended in a Triple tie in first place (51 points), with the last player no more than 5 points behind.

The tie breaker is the reverse order of the turn order, but we decided to call it a tie nonetheless.

I did not like the graphics/images, but that just personal taste.  The game play itself is fairly straight forward, especially if you have played other &quot;deck building&quot; type games before.

I liked the row of 6 cards where you can purchase as many cards as you have money, and kill as many monsters as you have attack points.  And there were plenty of &quot;banish&quot; cards which allowed you to thin out your deck.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>My first impression was that this was a pretty clean system, which provides a good feel for the period.  Some of the rules lead the game down a historical path, but this is more on the resource level, where the Japanese were struggling with a dwindling oil supply.  The transport pool is also straight forward and adds flavor to the game.  The only thing I did not like were the dice (which says a lot!)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A brain burner with a lot of down time.  Essentially a game of resource swapping... Way too long for what it is (over 2.5 hours + 30 minutes of rules explanations).

Card selection mechanic is interesting but does not alleviate the randomness issue.  Essentially you need to wait and hope that someone will lay down the card you are looking for.  If you have two good cards in hand, you have to take a chance and lay one down and hope no one selects it so you may select it on your next pass...  A weird approach for a card draft mechanic.

Once a player falls behind, there is next to no chance of getting back into the game, as the interaction is somewhat limited (and convoluted with 4-players and the aweful &quot;partner&quot; rule, where you may only interact, negatively, with the &quot;partner&quot; selected).

Score: 19-19-17-15
For the player at &quot;15&quot;, he/she needed 16+17 (30) coins to join 3rd place, and another +18+19 (70) to tie with first...  When you are generating a little over 20 per turn, you are somehow 3 turns behind the leaders, and are not generating enough cash to have a chance to catch up.  Loans could work, but the cost renders it useless as the price is a FULL point PER 5 coins at the END of the game, per card.  OUCH.

In a 4-player game, the &quot;Con Man&quot; card is next to impossible to target, as a quadruple planet alignment needs to occur first.  This card works better in a 3-player game, where there is no &quot;partner&quot; limitation.

Don&#039;t expect to play this again, and canceled my order.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The basic game is similar to &quot;Risk&quot; with an advanced combat system, greater variety of units, and a wider choice of possible actions.  The advanced game, which forces players to decide which actions one will make via the use of Oil Reserve Certificates (1st action costs 1 Oil, 2nd costs 2 Oil for a total of 3, etc.) is better, IMHO.

The ground and naval combat systems are also interesting and are quickly resolved.  The naval combat is somewhat unrealistic and gives the defender an advantage he should not have (limiting the number of ships which can engage in combat).

There are some loopholes in the system, namely the unsinkable lone Battleship.

The worst aspect of the game is the &quot;down time&quot; between player turns.  In a 5-player game, we have seen up to one hour go by before a player gets to do his turn!?!  The &quot;Action Card&quot; approach proposed by a player on BGG is, IMO, a very good suggestion which could alleviate this problem.</comment>	<conditiontext>Shrink - prefer to trade as a set with expansion</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A blocking game where one can be forced to skip multiple turns as player after player blocks you in (oh joy!), where the designer felt the need to implement a mechanic which forces the leader to change (leader may not play any 6 value cards), so leading throughout the race is not possible.

In my last game, the leader had to wait a few turns while the 2nd player caught up, as he could not play any of his THREE &quot;6&quot;s... It&#039;s sad when the play of a single card would secure the win, but because you can&#039;t play a 6, you have to wait two turns for a player to pass you, then he/she plays again to win, and you finish 2nd or 3rd...  Way too artificial for my tastes.

One needs to manage his cards (hand of three) as you have just about enough to go around the track three times.  If you always take the outside/long route, then forget it as you won&#039;t have enough cards to make it.  Feels too much like a Knizia game....

An interesting mechanic, but for me it does not work in a race setting as it is way too artificial.  And the price was outrageous for what you get.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is still an interesting game, although a bit long.  The modifications from the 1981 are mostly good, but I would have preferred a LARGER board!

Tried a &quot;Major Victory&quot; game, where one side needed to Capture four Capitals, but after 8 hours, we called the game.  It had become obvious the Axis would loose as the American navy had surrounded Japan, and the German attack against Russia had stalled.  With the Allies controlling the seas, the end for the Axis was inevitable (minus some terrible die rolling).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Although it first appeared to be a dicefest, the truth turned out to be quite different, as there is a good game in here.

Perhaps the units are not perfect and the colors may be off, but it&#039;s way better then some of the wargames I have seen in the past (Memoir 44 being the exception, for me).  :)

The collectibility can be annoying, so why not pick one side and trade the other units with another gamer who would prefer the other (side).  It could actually be enjoyable.

BTW, the Tiger I is very expensive to field, so you&#039;d be better off with a less expensive tank.  Too bad there are no Panzer III&#039;s in this set.  I look forward to the next three sets!!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Battle results are believeable, it&#039;s fast playing as ship facing has no impact (so forget crossing the &quot;T&quot;).  A 100 point fleet is too small, unless you&#039;d like to do CL and DD engagements...  Still, a single BC can whip a group of CL and DD&#039;s, no problem (unless the dice God is not with you).The collectability part is a real pain, making this a money pit.  I purchased a starter and a sealed case (12 boosters), and only had about 520 points per side.  Picked up a second sealed case, and am still missing 5 rare units.  After all, there are 24 rare units in the set, so 24 boosters is the minimum you need to purchase if you&#039;d like to have all the units (without going thru eBay).Another odd factor is the uncommon units.  Since there are only FIVE units in a booster, three are common, 1 is uncommon, and 1 is rare, there is not much difference between rare and uncommon, or so one would think.</comment>	<conditiontext>Have the following available for trade:  #32 USS TENNESSEE, #33 USS WASHINGTON

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Yet another variation of the Axis &amp; Allies system.  This one places the emphasis on Naval and Air combat, to the point were infantry only plays a figurative role (majority dictates who &quot;controls&quot; the island).

Game appears to degenerate into a slugfest in the center of the board.  There does not appear to be much room for tactics, and the artilery piece, which is both used as a majority piece on land an a canon versus ships in adjacent sea zones, is way too powerful for its cost (2).

Will be playing this one again to see if my opinion will change (I have been playing A&amp;A and its variants since 1981).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Game is somewhat long (3-4 hours).  The combat system is refreshing, but requires a lot of die rolling.  I&#039;m not a big fan of using D12&#039;s, but can understand the need to do so to make the hit allocation system work.

Unfortunately I found the game ends as soon as the allied air units (3:1) come into play, as they just pulverize everything in sight, and there is little which can be done to stop them.

Will be re-reading the rules and trying this one again to see if we missed anything.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>41</numplays>			<comment>A very interesting and fast playing card game.  Players get to &quot;defend&quot; by hiding being a barel or playing &quot;missed&quot; cards.

Played with 5 players and everyone enjoyed it.  Will be playing this one again soon.  :)

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Fairly easy game to play, with some player negotiations.  There is some luck involved (die rolling to move your pawn), and everyone gets to pick one of three actions (hidden via the use of a card) to determine which action you will make (if two players selected the same action, the need to negotiate to determine who will get to do the action, but if there are three or more who picked the same card, none get to do the action).

At the end of each of the three rounds (moving your pawn around the board), majority is checked for each type of gem, and points are awarded.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I find this one better than NAVAL BATTLES, although the luck element can and does have a big impact on the game.  Still, one can be rewarded for planning an attack by waiting a few turns to get the cards needed.  Other times, a quick strike may bag you a few points.

The game can be a bit long, but once players know the cards, it should be a bit faster.

The Catalina-PBY card (?) which allows you to grab two cards from your opponent is too powerful.  Perhaps having your opponent discard two cards randomly would work better, or drawing one card.  But since this is a hand management game, taking two cards away equals a 4 card differential, which is quite substantial.  Of course, if the same player draws the two PBY cards...  Not to mention Radio Triangulation...

Last but not least, there are card combos which can be quite good.  Overall, the game is interesting, but not quite enough to make it to a 7, IMHO.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is a good game.  Played with the basic rules, which means no magic.  It&#039;s medieval combat, using the COMMANDS &amp; COLORS: ANCIENT system, with a few minor changes.  DoW did an awesome job with the pieces, as they are made of sturdy yet flexible plastic which is perfect for paint.


The rest of the production is of top quality, from the full color perfect bound 80 page rulebook, the scenario book, the counters, the plastic playing pieces and the double sided board (one side is divided for &quot;Overlord&quot; type setup, so two boards would have 3 sections as opposed to 6, for those of us who like epic battles!).


As opposed to GMT&#039;s approach of using hardwood blocks, DoW went with generic units which all have a socket for a flag.  One differentiates the units with flags, one flag per 3-4 pieces, depending on type.  Of course there are light, medium and heavy Infantry and Cavalry, along with archers.  Long swords and short swords, bow and crossbows.


Definitely a must have for those who enjoyed C&amp;C:A and like the Medieval period, as well as those looking for a more challenging game than M&#039;44.  Highly recommended!</comment>	<conditiontext>Shrink - Note: box has a split corner

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>Get ready to be immersed in this theme heavy coop game where you are sure at least one of your shipmates is a Cylon!

It is a risk and resource management game, which is fairly easy to play, and where the action takes place during the Crisis Resolution step at the tail end of every player&#039;s turn.  Most of the time, players will get to &quot;vote&quot; (using their action cards) on the crisis at hand.

WARNING: As with most games, it can be quite boring when played with the wrong type of players.  Even more so with this one.  Table talk is a large part of the game, so if you don&#039;t like Co-Op games or dislike the theme, stay away.

Following a jump, there will be a few duller moments.  This is the time when you will want to pick up additional cards or use Recon Patrol to help with the next jump or ensure nothing really nasty is waiting for you with the next Crisis card.

NEGATIVE ASPECT: Can be long if you&#039;re not into this type of game or dislike the theme.

The Skill cards are too small (standard sized cards would have been better, IMHO)

A die would have been better when rolling to damage the Galactica (location) and/or Cylon BaseStar, instead of having to shuffle a pile of tokens.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>This is a light role playing space combat game where each player takes the role of a crew member aboard a starship.

The Damage allocation system is interesting, damage being assigned to the various modules based on the direction from which the hit/missile came from, then penetration damage is spread across other modules in a straight line (except for missile hits which are represented by damage to adjoining modules instead).

I also liked the idea of allowing the players a free reroll when doing a skill check in their specialization.

On the negative side, the game can get repetitive, as one continuously moves between stations.  This also negatively impacts the speed of the game.

The rules contain some inconsistencies and some abilities/actions may be misleading because flavor text was used.

This one came close to an &#039;8&#039;, but for the above reasons a &#039;6&#039; is more appropriate.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>First off, this game is different from BOHNANZA, so don&#039;t expect to plant beans!  You will be filling bean orders here, so you&#039;ll need to purchase/trade for what you need.  The movement mechanic is interesting, in that cards are laid down in order to move - special cards are actioned when then come up, so you might have to pay a Toll ($20) or there might be a harvest.

Players need to manage both moves and beans, and must maximize profits and minimize movement.  You will need to purchase beans you don&#039;t necessarily need in order to have something to trade/deal with other players.

The randomness some claim to see in this one can be overcomed by a bit of thinking/planning and by negotiating an invitation to trade (cost = 1 card).

If at all possible, try to negotiate with other players to trade one or two turns down the road, based on the Cities you will be visiting (to deliver an order), thus for beans you will have the potential of purchasing to trade with them.

If you don&#039;t like thinking, planning, trading/dealing games, this one is not for you.</comment>				</item>

Worker placement, economy building, area majority game.

Elves, Dwarves and Gnomes...  The setting/theme does noting for me.

Catching up to the leader(s) may prove rather difficult...  Even with the most revenue (Gold) and workers, I finished last, even though I was building one building per turn...  Something does not work for me in this game, and I just can&#039;t put my finger on it at this time.  Will probably try it again at some point.</comment>				</item>

Actually, it is an improved [gameid=119] with a different slapped on theme.

There are a few added twists such as tiles which can be removed, 3 boards, 3 different set of tiles (one per board).

FFG did a good job with the components, but sadly, it remains too close to the original to be that much better.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>An Ok game where the first part (pre-haunt) is a race to explore a house and gather items.  The second part (haunt) is triggered following a failed throw versus the number of Omen cards in play.  A traitor is then revealed and the players find out what their mission will be.

The game can be fairly fast.  Combat is unforgiving, as attacker or source will receive a certain amount of damage based on the differential of their dice throw.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A light set collecting game.

There are 6 turns in the game, and in the first 5 your warehouse receives a stack of your company&#039;s game to distribute to different stores.

Next, some or all of your games may be distributed to one of the six stores (players decide in turn order, placing 1 face down counter in the appropriate store - each store only accepts a certain range of games)    After all players have passed, play moves to the next phase.

Next, each player rolls 3 dice, which are used to represent buyers.  The pips determine at which store these buyers will go.

Following this, each player may spend 1 gg to move one of his die to an adjacent store, or reroll 1 die.  After all players have passed, play moves to the next phase.

Flip all face down tiles, then player with the lowest die/dice total goes first, by placing one of his die on a game in the store the die is located at.

Once all die are placed, players receive (for free) the games they have selected, while GG is given to the player selling the game.  Essentially you are giving points to the other player, but at no cost to you.

After the 6th round, players tally up their bonus score.  For each set of tiles they have collected of a given number (set = 1 copy of each game in the numbered series).  Points = number of tiles in the set x 6 (duplicates are worth nothing).

Non-set tiles are worth the number (1-6) listed on them.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The vector mechanic is relatively easy to use, and may be somewhat difficult to visualize for the first few games, but it works well!  No more looking for dice or counting how many squares you need to move to make it into the curve.  Luck factor has been eliminated.I did notice a few problems though.  First, it can take over an hour to go around the track once, especially with more players.Second, the &#039;breaking&#039; rule is absurd.  A player can pass everyone else at FULL speed (7 in our game) entering a hairpin turn (!?), apply the breaks, and be out of the curve the next turn.  For the rest of the players who slowed down, it will take them three turns to negotiate the turn...  Dropped the rating to 4.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>An interesting bidding game, where one tries to win the bid in order to have first pick of available Mining operations and/or cards (Dynamite, Saloon, etc.).

High bid passes the amount he/she bid to the player on his/her right.  Receiving player takes Â½ and passes to his/her right, etc.

Then bid winner picks first, followed by the player to his left (clockwise order).

First player to gain a pair of Mines in a color becomes the &quot;Mayor&quot; of that City (color).  Anytime someone picks up a mine, he/she must pay the Mayor of that City (color) $1 per card the Mayor holds in that color.

Makes for an interesting bidding game, where players try to maximize their selection based on the amount of $ their selecting or not selecting a card will bring them.

This is followed by a 2d6 roll, the total indicating which mines produce (similar to Settlers of Catan).

Then you repeat the process until the deck of cards runs out.  Players attempt to take over the Mayor-ship of the various Cities (colors) by having 1 more card of that color.

Points are awarded for each $ + 1 point for each Mine&#039;s production capacity + 5 points for each Mayor the player controls.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Relatively easy to learn game.  Your objective is to make a $1M by transporting and selling your resources to North America.  Your mine is located in England, where the money used is the Pound.  The US$ acts as victory points as it is not interchangeable with the Pound.

To win, one must control the means of transportation, which includes Lorries (trucks), Ferries and Boats (trans-atlantic).  Using only one section of the mounted board makes for a good 3-player game.  The event cards add just about the right amount of uncertainty.  The good card ratio is about 1:3, while the bad cards are 2:3.

Played a 6 player game on Nov.16/2006, and 4 players did not like the game that much.  Then again we played for over 3 hours and had just started selling resources to N.America...  One player was played with bad luck/bad cards, as he would keep loosing his resources and/or his trucks would be hit by landslides or strikes.  He was not a happy camper.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is a pickup and deliver type game, where your mine produces ore, which you then need to transport to the warehouse (via truck or ferry), sell for Pounds Sterling, or transport to the US (via ferry or Boat) for US $$.  The currencies are NOT interchangeable!  First player to $1,000,000 US wins!

There is a fair bit of luck, as production is random, in that your mine will generate resources only if you roll a &quot;6&quot; (I think).  Your movement is also random, as you roll 1d6 for movement each turn, although you may spread the pips to any and all of your transporters.

Following this, you may rent three modes of transportation.  From the mine to the Warehouse you have the option of a Lorry (capacity = 2) (a.k.a. a truck) for 5 pounds, or a Ferry (capacity = 10), which costs you a certain amount per turn.  Extra space on the ferry may be rented to your opponents, for a fixed amount.

Once at the warehouse, you may sell your resources for 20,000 pounds each (IIRC), while the same resource is only worth 5,000 pounds at the mine.

From the Warehouse to the USA, you may rent either a Ferry (10) or a Ship (10).  The ship rental fee is higher, but it&#039;s route is shorter and it goes to NYC, which offers the best value for the resources.  The ferry allows you to chose between NYC or another port which is about half-way distance wise, but offers less per unit.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>The base game plays quickly as players chose one of their &quot;ammo&quot; cards (you start with 8, three of which are &quot;loaded&quot;), then simultaneously choose their target by pointing their guns, followed by the &quot;Italian word&quot; phase where players either decide to chicken out (lower then character card) or prononce the Italian word and stay up hoping anyone targetting him/her does not have a loaded gun.

After resolving the firing phase (&quot;Bang, Bang, Bang&quot; going first followed by the &quot;Bang&quot; cards), players still standing up divvy up the loot (only equal portions are taken, any remainder is left for the next round).  At the end of the 8th round, players add their loot, removing $5K per &quot;Chicken&quot; counter.

BTW, when someone gets shot 3 times he/she is out of the game, so sometimes it is best to duck and take the chicken counter.

The game is Ok to play, especially if players add in a bit of role playing.  Unfortunately, I find the price tag for this one to be way too high for a deck of cards, 6 rubber guns and a handful of counters.  Still a game I am willing to play if someone else has picked it up.

Playing with the first expansion adds a bit more spice, without complicating the game, nor slowing it.  Recommended.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Tactical WWI Air Combat game.  System is 90% Blue Max, 10% enhancements, which includes altitude.  Rules are freely available off several web sites.

Easy to learn and fast playing (simultaneous moves).

1-player per plane.

Game can be played using counters, but looks much better with 1/72nd scale model planes mounted on an antena stand (see photo gallery) especially when on fire or smoking!!

All maneuvers available to your plane are listed graphically, so you can visualize where your plane will be at the end of the turn, as well as which facing it will have.  Since movement is simultaneous, you need to estimate where your target will go, and try to get your plane into firing position!

Hosted CE games for the Ottawa Canvas Eagles Group from 2001 to 2004.

In order to enhance our campaign game, I created, in 2003, an Operational Level Campaign System, which was used to port all tactical combat to the CE table.  Planes, pilots, location, formation and surprise provided an added level of excitement in our games.

Perhaps too much luck involved in the card draw.  The special cards don&#039;t help either, as other players can really mess you up with those.  Could not be tempted to play this again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>This is NOT a brain burner, and could easily be accessible to the entire family.  It may be a little long to explain initially, perhaps due to the impact each Building/House placement has on the value of adjacent Buildings.

This impact makes the game quite interesting, as the denser the town&#039;s core, the more expensive it is to buy land at that location!  At the same time, it&#039;s a great spot for the placement of a Bank or Saloon!

The forced placement of houses whenever buildings are placed (except for Mines and Ranches), makes this system work quite nicely.

&quot;Role selection&quot; is fairly straight forward, as the character you select will give you a bonus of some sort, but will also limit the amount of cash you may carry over from turn to turn...

One of the finer aspects of this game is that you are never out of the running, there is always a different approach or strategy you can use!  Multiple combos are open to you (Saloon/Hotel, Drugstore/Ranches, Bank/Mines, etc), and you&#039;ll also find spaces to generate income should you be short.

The &quot;road&quot; approach (actions are conducted one space at a time along the &quot;road&quot;) makes for easy turn resolution, and each space is placed intelligently!  For example, buying land occurs before you may purchase buildings, and income only comes AFTER these buying phases, so you better have kept some money from the previous turn.  But wait, after income you may purchase the all important points!  What to do, what to do?!

And I almost forgot, there are also &quot;Show downs&quot; a.k.a duels, as only ONE player may perform each action (except for 2 which may be performed by multiple players), so if more than one player placed a cowboy at a location, the duel is conducted by a single die roll (adding your &quot;fire power&quot; rating as a bonus).  The winner may conduct the action, the looser(s) receive their cowboy, which may be used at a later turn, and which immediately provides you with a &quot;fire power&quot; bonus.

Ohh, and there are only four turns...

There is one thing I really dislike, and it&#039;s the fact that very few points are scored in the few 2-3 rounds, so you end up with a large amount of points scored in the last round... Makes for a rather un-rewarding ending.</comment>				</item>

Some cards unbalance the game, especially when they are drawn by the same 1-2 players...

Advantage seems to go to player who plays 1st, therefore horses are important to get... as are all the other resources.  A euro with dice (random resource production, which is then pooled, then picked from in turn order.  :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>For a Euro type game, there is luck involved.  Although the trade mechanic is fun, it really is all about selecting the best location to establish your towns/cities.

If your numbers don&#039;t come up often, then you will quickly fall behind.  Initial placement, luck of the die and cards make a very large difference at the start of the game, but can be compensated via inter-player trade.</comment>				</item>

Everything you need to know about the game is right on the board or on the tiles, so there is little need for player aids (although newbies should use them).

You will always have more things you&#039;d like to do than you have resources, so resource management is the key to everything.

The money (denier) coins are too thin/small and should be replaced by poker chips.</comment>	<conditiontext>Shrink</conditiontext>			</item>

NOT recommended with 3 players as the Thieve&#039;s role is next to useless as the other players can ofteb spend all their gold with one of their character&#039;s, thus leaving nothing for the Thief at the start of the target role&#039;s turn.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An excellent CIV game.

If we could rate the designer, Christian Marcussen would be in my top 3 list.  Also enjoy his [gameid=25292].

The game flows fairly well, but you will need to play a few turns in order to understand the intricacies of this one.  The tech tree has built in prerequisites which do not require a complex tree/branch diagram.  Really like the simplicity of the solution offered here.

Gives a good feel of a CIV game, and the simplicity of the combat allows you to focus on the CIV side, not war (although there are more than enough tech options, adding pips and dividing by 5, as in [gameid=232], keeps things moving).

The Event Deck, which triggers the Barbarians, adds enough uncertainty in the beginning turns.

The Objective cards, which are dual-use (Development at the top, Military at the bottom) is again a simple and elegant solution, giving players some flexibility.

Some nasty events give you VP, which allows you to stay in the running for total VP.


One player had some issues with the movement rules, specifically when an army moves in a mountain (no more moves this turn) or through a forest (may move again, but cannot combat).  Although this rule may appear gamey, the ROADS tech gives you some flexibility here (but your surprise attack will cost you some resources).

My new favorite CIV game!  Looking forward to playing it again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Gorgeous looking game, with the usual high quality components we have come to expect from Days of Wonder.  Unfortunately, the lamest DoW game I have seen to date.  The game rules are geared towards rewarding the last place player, by having them steal a token from the leader...  Game Leader auto-bashing?

In the last game I played, I lead the first four (out of five) rounds, only to finish dead last, a good 10 points from 3rd place...  Interestingly, I went out of my way to not finish in first place on one round, but still did...  My friends recall this game by the Janis &quot;show&quot;, where I was only able to produce a horse, out of the four tiles needed for the show, yet I still managed to remain in first place.  LOL!</comment>	<conditiontext>Excellent condition, near mint.  Has been played a few (3) times.</conditiontext>			</item>

Really like the Provincial production and the coin collecting to reset the Provincial production.  Wished the Provinces included more than 2-3 Cities...

Players were going for easy (ie. solo) builds in a 3-player game.  Will need to try same number on Italia map as it is tighter.</comment>				</item>

2-player and 4-player versions available (different boards).  Nice pieces which can lock together (Soldier &amp; Elephant, Soldier &amp; Chariot, etc.)

Area movement where each side has 20 moves per turn.  If you capture an opponent&#039;s piece, he/she immediately gets 2 moves to respond, unless it was your last action.</comment>				</item>

The base game is an adaptation of RISK.

Yet, ship deliveries are a good way of making much needed cash, and a few points as well.

Game may suffer from a run away leader problem.

Player interaction is limited to the bidding for the different Offices (i.e. turn order) as well as the available Production/Commerce/Special tiles.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting approach to a semi-closed economic game.  You have no direct control over anything other then the price you set for your goods, and what you need to do is entice the other players to pickup and deliver the goods you need on the center island.  Hopefully you will have the cash necessary to bid for their delivery.The components are generally nice, and I especially like the size of the ships.  The color of the ships are so so at best (they can be painted over), and the game cannot be played by color blind people (some colors are difficult to differentiate for those of us who are NOT color blind!)With only two actions to perform when it is your turn to play, downtime appears to be minimal.</comment>				</item>

The movement system is rather interesting as player lay down octogons as per the pattern on their maneuver card to find out where their plane will end its movement.  Firing and damage is straight forward, and damage is applies by clicking the target plane&#039;s base, thus reducing its capabilities.  Also comes with a bar brawl sub game.  Anyone who has played a WizKids type game before should have no problems stepping into this one.  But don&#039;t expect a realistic battle, as the game is set in the &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; alternate universe.  It is still enjoyable, and a game can be played in under 30 minutes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A pure speculation game.  I like the fact that this game is relatively simple, so no brain burning required except when a news event triggers a tax/fees, then the calculator has to come out.

Very nice components (Stronghold Games edition).

This is a 4-player game, with rules for 3 and 2 players, but it still plays like a 4 player game (with a dummy @ 3 players, and each player controlling 2 zones @ 2 players).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Two plays in (still learning the game)

Good game on the Third Crusade.  It is fairly quick to play (3-4 hours) and the mechanics work well, IMHO.  Every turn there are some though decisions to be made, from deciding to consolidate, muster, launch an attack, reinforce a City or try to lift a siege.

The combat system is similar to the one found in WIZARD KINGS and to some extent VICTORY!, but one has more options such as &#039;Charge&#039; for Crusader units, &#039;Harry&#039; for Saracens and Turcopoles.  Not to mention &#039;Storm Castle&#039; and &#039;Sally&#039; to meet the besieging forces on the field.

The beauty of the system is the limited resources you have, represented by the cards.  Therefore you need to have a general idea of what you&#039;d like to do during each of the 6 game years, while retaining some flexibility in order to counter your opponents moves.

If you&#039;re interested in this period, I recommend you read THOMAS F. MADDEN&#039;s review here on BGG, as well as his book, [b][i]The New Concise History of the Crusades[/i][/b], which gives a good overview of the period.  [u]ISBN[/u]: 0-7425-3822-2 (hardcover)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I enjoyed this title, which appears to be a well balanced mix of mechanics from other games.  Each player has the same 5 &quot;roles&quot;, of which he/she will play 4, the 5th being used for the voting phase of the game.

One of the &quot;roles&quot; collects resources/produce for the player.  Another role allows for the  building/purchase of building tiles, similar to Caylus.  Players score points when they deliver goods to the boats at the dock (value of delivery increases the longer the board stays in port).

The 5th &quot;role&quot;, which was not played, now acts as the number of votes the player has for the Political Phase, where 2 out of 4 new laws are selected by the winner of the vote &quot;bid&quot; (pesos can be added to bonify your &quot;offer&quot;).

All in all, good game length, clear mechanic, has multiple paths to victory (via tile combos, different strategies, etc.).  IMHO, way ahead of PR.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The version we played had wooden pieces...
Our 5-player game dragged and was longer than 3 hours.  Players would bid and overbid, in an attempt to block one another.  I was able to build my first metropolis on the last turn of the game... Was able to get Ares (God of War) once during the game...  Mythological creatures unbalances what could have been a balanced game...  The player with the most money has an advantage that appears difficult to overcome.

After a second game (4-players this time), found it to be too dependent on luck (die rolls in combat, card draw for creatures, as well as the Gods when played with less than 5 players).  And it dragged, again, over 2.5 hours... If one player plays badly, it really skews the game, and then there is the dreaded King Maker moves...  After 2.5 hours, really??

Not recommended.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Game play is fairly straightforward, winning will require some planning, and a bit of luck (combat requires a success on a die, and is similar to [gameid=15987]).

Very nicely produced components!
(laser cutting does leave a bit of sooth)

Cards are of good quality (size: standard M:TG)

Love the board, as it lies flat.  It does require minor assembly (4 puzzle pieces).

Rulebook: Full color!

As with most games, requires one play through in order to grasp all the mecanics.  We had to remind players to draw an Event card when they were not at the Monastery.  Had to look up some rules, as players did not understand that you can only remove a blight when you are the one attacking it (your Action).  Further, there are two sets of numbers on each blight.  One if when you attack it on your turn, the other, on the back, is when it forces you to attack/defend (those numbers are usually lower).

Edit: 3 plays in with 3-Players, 4-Players and 2-Players, and this is a winner for me.  Already ordered the expansion, and looking forward to trying out the 4 new characters!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>DOOM in the RUNEBOUND universe.  It is an interesting tactical combat game in an adventure setting.  The game can take some time to complete (4 - 6 hours) and I don&#039;t particularly like the GM drawing cards and &quot;preparing&quot; traps for you by spawning in front and behind your party.  Like DOOM, in that you need to keep pressing forward, else you&#039;ll loose.

I would have prefered some sort of event deck which gets triggered randomly, and where all players are playing together.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Rating dropped from 6 to 4.  After a few more plays with 3 marines, it has become obvious this game is unbalanced.  Although the monsters scale up with the number of players, the ammunition does not so you are sharing whatever is on that level with the extra players.  Perhaps it works better with 1 or 2 marines?  With a full complement of (3) marine players, the object is not really to fight, but to run to the exit.

For what it is, the game it too long.  The interlocking &quot;map&quot; pieces are nice, so are most of the plastic minis.  The larger monsters have a warped base.

Another issue is with the writing on the special dice, which wears off after about 12 games.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Very good concept, but flawed execution.  Everyone starts &quot;naked&quot;, and you need lady luck on your side in order to &quot;pass&quot; those labyrinth challenges, which will provide you with weapons, armor, transportation or the likes.  It would be more interesting as a squad based combat system, IMO, with both sides starting with weapons.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Played two 6-player games, both with the Fremen, and was utterly unimpressed.

I had never seen a more unbalanced game, where some players are spectators more than anything else (especially the Freman).

This is a game where the stong will go out of their way to take out the weak, because the winner gets rewarded in spice (the game&#039;s currency) for taking out leaders, theirs included.  Unfortunately, that makes the weak a prime target, and they only get weaker, not to say taken out of the &quot;game&quot;, if it can be called that.

By pure luck (4 worm signs out of 5 cards), and multiple alliance changes in a row, the Fremen are now somehow in a position to win a battle...  Unfortunately, they don&#039;t have any leaders.

In my two games, my impression was that I had no control whatsoever.  It is a diplomatic game more than anything else, but since the Fremen have nothing of value to offer, it is very difficult to enter into an alliance, let alone collect any spice which may help them get out of this predicament.  Does this sound like a solid &quot;10&quot; game?

To add insult to injury, the Atreides sells info to the B.G., letting that player know which cards you purchased...  

Based on my experiences, I am unable to see where&#039;s the enjoyment.  Surely these players don&#039;t play with the Fremen!  An utterly pointless game, yet I was wiling to give this one another try, as so many folks here appear to enjoy this game (for the life of me, I can&#039;t understand why).

Merits a 1, but the game oozes with theme, so it earns a 2 (most pointless 4 hour non-game I have ever seen).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A light-medium game, with some randomness.  As can be expected from Phalanx, the board is nice, as are the components.

Fairly easy to learn and quick to play.  Rules translations is OK, although some points are not clear, and there are a few word transpositions...

In the setup for example, one places 1 Influence marker (cardboard token) and two Movement tokens (wooden cylinder).  They why it is described in the manual, it would seem they have this reversed, as they list the number of each token remaining, which are the totals for the OTHER pieces.  After setup, you should have the following remaining (unless I interpretted things wrong):

3 Movement tokens
5 Influence markers</comment>				</item>

Kind of a combo of checkers and [thing=528][/thing], except the stacks must move as many spaces are there are tokens in it.  Token on top of the stack denotes the owning player.  Player with the most tokens at the end of the game (when no more moves are possible) wins.

Prefer [thing=7854][/thing] in this series.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A good Euro.  You only have 3 actions each turn, although some you can do more than once if you have the Agents/Samurai needed (sometimes both).

You start with 3 action cards, each one with 4 possible actions.  Problem is there is always one on which you&#039;d like to do two actions, but you can only select one...

Makes for some tough decisions.

Trade is key, IMHO.

We had a player who never feed her Samurai until the last turn... She finished 2nd.  So instead of spending an action collecting rice, she spent it sending Samurais on the board and moving them.  Interesting action management.

Collecting resources can be iffy, as the more Samurai in that location, the less resources you collect.

Points are made when building (House-1, Trading Post-2, Fortress-3, and trading).  Income is generated in each city when you have a House or your Trading Post, and is affected by the number of players with buildings in that location (ie. area majority).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This one appears to be a light worker placement and resource management game.  After a few plays, one quickly finds out that it&#039;s a tad heavier than that.  Randomness is very limited (Sphinx cards), but may be mitigated by utilizing more resources to draw more cards (up to 5, may keep 1, rest are converted to victory points).

One side of the Nile has market and worker upgrades, as well as 3 building sites.  The other side has bonus cards, which you can collect by placing one of your ships (workers) there.

After the placement of ships along the Nile, players must feed their workers (based on their total strength), pays in VP any food shortages.  The Nile has three water levels; the better fields always produce, while the other two types are dependent on the water&#039;s level.  This simple mechanic provides enough incentive to increase food output at the same time as one increases his/her work force.

Next, all queries produce stones, which you will need at the three building sites, assuming you were able to place a ship there (there are only 3 spots at each, with the possibility of a forth, if someone is unable to build).

Following this, players receive bonus points based on cooperation at the building sites.  Essentially, you get 1/3/6 bonus points depending on how many sites you worked on.

Each construction provides 1 VP per stone/worker required.  To place 1 stone, 1 worker is required, so having a larger work force then you have stones is only going to end up costing you more food.  You need to use a balanced approach when it comes to Stones, Food and Workers.

Each building of the three building sites requires/provides different bonuses:

- Sphinx (you can purchase up to 5 cards, may only keep one, the rest are returned to the bottom of the deck, and are converted into an immediate 1 VP bonus.  These cards provide end game bonuses (4-10 points), if you have meet the indicated requirement.  There is a similar bonus mechanic in AMUN RE).
- Tomb/Obelisk (there are building constraints here, and when you build here, you also receive a free upgrade in either the food or stone market)
- Pyramid/Temple (similar constraints here, with the pyramid providing extra points for majority in each row.  Further, there are numerous Sphinx cards for this area)

All in all, a relatively simple game, which offers some interesting decisions and a multitude of paths to victory (bonus cards, building, etc.).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>An interesting game that has nothing to do with SETTLERS OF CATAN.

The building permit mechanic adds an extra level of strategy, as does the possibility of building over smaller buildings.

There may be some down time during the first game, but that is to be expected with most games.  While other players are taking their turns, everyone should be reviewing the board and figuring out their next move(s), or checking out how they can block other players.

The luck factor is limited, and should be viewed more as a bonus, as you can trade the building permit phase for 2 gold.

Each player controls his/her destiny by selecting different actions.  Although you&#039;d like to do everything, you are limited in what you can do.  Nothing wrong with that, in my books.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Only played one game.  Setup was a little long, and needs to be followed step-by-step.  Game play becomes fairly intuitive after a few turns.

It&#039;s lighter than ARKHAM HORROR, but it&#039;s about the same length.  A 3 hour game time is most probably possible if the game is already set up and everyone knows how to play.

Components are of great quality, as we have come to expect from FFG.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A game of maximizing and balancing your actions.

Easy to learn, intuitive play, nice components, and clean mechanic which works well with the theme.  Especially like the way labor payments are handled!

Excellent replay value as tokens are redistributed every game.

NOT language specific.  Only the rules are required, and the names on the board and buildings if you really want to.

Played 5-player and 3-player games.  With more players are choices are fewer and it is more difficult to plan between turns, but you still have multiple choices and may still adapt your play.

Can be somewhat difficult to determine who&#039;s in the lead, until you&#039;ve played a few games.

All information is on the table, so game will be slower with AP players...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>19</numplays>			<comment>A great little coop game, which takes no more than 10 minutes to play.

Only 6 pages of rules.  Initially used ALL the tiles, then figured out there was a basic set as well as a Treasure and Curses set...  And most importantly, there are 13 tiles to a set, PLUS 4 tiles with multiple gem locations.

Components are great for what they are.

Everyone enjoyed their first experience... so much so we played 8 games in a row, in just about 90 minutes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Only one play using the AMARR and MINMATAR starter decks.  Found it rather unbalanced in favor of te Minmatar, as my ships were fairly quickly disposed of by my opponent, as all I seem to have were mining ships...  Of course this requires more plays, but we will most probably be using the other starters to see if it is more balanced.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Only played once with 5-players and don&#039;t see why I would want to give this another try.  The card draft mechanic is the only thing I found to be Ok, but I played with experienced players and had no idea what I was looking for (which combinations to try and get).  My opponents obviously had no problems blocking whatever it is I was trying to do, while both left and right opponents are the ones who scored the most (obviously I was not blocking them).  Definitely not for me.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A different twist to a bidding game.  Players all place one of their cards face down, and 1 card is revealed until one player opts to pass, at which time s/he picks up the tokens from the 2nd column (a passing bonus if you will) and reveals the second card.  All players who did not pass may bid, the next player to pass takes the money from the 3rd column, etc.  Placing the last card provides you with a slight advantage as you know what that card is, and may therefore know the total # of points this hand will yield once the next to last card is revealed, making bluffing a distinct possibility.

The total may be negative, although some of the &#039;bad&#039; cards cancel each other out if there is a pair of them on the table.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The AsmodÃ©e edition has very nice bits and a good looking board.  Somehow, the &quot;Fury&quot; must have been lost in translation as combat is minimal.  Even though I suck at die rolling, I prefer more combat than what is offered here (which is mostly Trade and Settlements).

Being able to do 7 actions all at once is good, but while the other players are taking their turn there is very little for you to do.  With the downtime, I was able to plan my next turn while my opponents were doing theirs, then still had time to kill, therefore making this game a tad boring for me.</comment>				</item>

Don&#039;t be frightened by the &quot;High Complexity&quot; rating this game has, since the rules are intuitive.

The mapboard is nice, but the spotting rules are a bit odd.  Best played with a GM (i.e. 3-players).  Lends itself well to PBeM!!  :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Rolling the die to see if you even get to do something that turn is a little too chaotic for me, but apart from that, the game is OK.

I like the tongue in cheek reference to Star Trek, but I would have retained the colors! (unless Paramount has reserved the rights for the association of Red with Security?  And being killed if you are new to the ship and sent on an away mission?)

The game plays fairly quickly, and the semi-coop aspect on the 2nd mission keeps the other players interested in everyone&#039;s action, as they can they offer to &quot;assist&quot;, to get first pick at the card reward.

The components are Ok for what the are, and the cards have an acceptable thickness.  Only thing is they cannot be sleeve with regular sleeves, and the square ones (for the 2-player game of Catan) are too large  :(</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is a nice, quick playing race game, in which you need to manage your car&#039;s speed via gear shifting.  Each gear uses a different die; 1st = d4, 2nd = d6, 3rd = d8, 4th = d12, 5th = d20, 6th = d30.  Races are 1 to 3 laps, depending on how much time you want to spend, and how complex you want the game to be.  Pit stops are possible with 2 and 3 lap races.</comment>				</item>

The combat mechanic is interesting, especially with more than 2 players!

The game is especially well balanced when there are more than 2 players.  Of course, more players means more time to play.

If you enjoy deck building, this one can present some interesting options, depending on the Hero/Vilain you choose.</comment>	<conditiontext>All cards are in plastic sleeves</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>A refreshing coop game, where 4 players try to track down and kill Dracula.  The Dracula player has a deck of cards which s/he uses to move secretly about the board, while at the same time setting up encounters/traps for the other players.  Dracula&#039;s objective is to &quot;mature&quot; vampires and stay alive long enough to accumulate 6 Vampire points.  Everyone else tries to prevent this from happening.

The move/action sequence plays really fast, and there is no down time unless there is combat.  Once combat starts, it can be somewhat tedious if you don&#039;t have the right item(s), so it may be best to run to fight another day.  The combat system is &quot;blow-by-blow&quot;, which makes it last a little longer, but it&#039;s entertaining to watch, initially anyways.

If you like &quot;Mr. X&quot; or &quot;Scotland Yard&quot; type games, this one comes highly recommended.

My copy did have one unfortunate problem; the counter sheet was not punched thoroughly, thus most of the encounter tokens where damaged when we tried to punch them out.  We even tried using an xacto, but that didn&#039;t help.  :(

I wrote to FFG and they promptly sent me a replacement flat!  Excellent customer service!!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Rating after a 6-player game.  The game is a very light version of Twilight Imperium, but still takes a long time to play with 6 players.  After the game a few of us discussed the possibility of trying it again, but with only 4 players.

In order to win one has to score the most victory points (VP chits are the only hidden info), and VP are accumulated via the control of planets (1 VP/planet) as well as the destruction/removal of the last &quot;influence&quot; token (i.e. control marker) of an opponent (1 VP).

The Regent phase, where the VPs are scored and where it is possible to place 2-3 Influence/Control markers, allows players to reduce someone else&#039;s control of a system, or even take control without firing a shot.  Although cheaper than building ships, it can give you the edge, until you can reinforce with the navy.

Our 6-player game ended with the following scores: 29, 26, 21, 14, 14 and 12.  My impression was that the person with 26 points would win, but another player&#039;s last play was to not attack the leaders, thus allowing them to retain their planets/points as well as score 2 easy points, else it would have been tighter for 1st place.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Reminds me of X-COM: UFO DEFENSE.  Nice game components, and a clean mechanics.  The campaign game is good.

Games can drag/be too long, and there is something which doesn&#039;t jive with the dice combat system.  Too often 4 or 5 hits are scored, only to be ALL blocked by the defense, which has a 30% chance per die.  If this is bad luck, it can really scrap what was, up to that point, a good game.

Unfortunately, this game will not hit the table as often as it should as one member of my game group finds it too long...  time to find new players  ;)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>A light/funny game which combines a few elements: tile laying (when building your ship), light racing game (when going thru the &quot;adventure deck&quot;) and resource collecting/management (energy and cargo).

Although it may be played by the entire family, there is nothing anyone can do to prevent an experienced player from winning, not to mention that the element of luck is rampant.

In the last game I have played, the experienced player never had more than ONE empty square on his ship!  In the third race, he had a laser in EVERY column, and only one empty square still...  It becomes extremely difficult to get the proper tiles as everyone draws from the same pool, so there is a large element of luck during the draw, as sometimes you will get a good piece you can&#039;t use, and of course someone else will grab it.  The experienced players will know which pieces NOT to return to the center.

Best (fun) played versus players of the same level.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Speculation game, fairly well balanced.  No one is out of the race until the money is counted at the end.

Easy to learn, fairly quick to play.  Expect some tough decisions along the way!  The Production Certificates and bidding are quite important.

Players cannot be blocked, but you can slow them down.

Excellent mechanic of increased costs due to expanding infrastructure, but having a card which moves every other player&#039;s train backwards 3 to 5 spaces, regardless of cost.  Allows trailing players to catch up too.

Production quality is EXCELLENT!!</comment>	<conditiontext>Game components in excellent condition.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>In our first game, we had missed the following very important setup instruction:
&quot;[i]&quot;Each player places one of his production cards of each type, face up, in his play area in front of his screen&quot;.[/i]&quot;.

Tried it a second time and something just does not feel right, as it is too easy to take out a good building from your neighbor to the left (i.e. next player), and there is nothing he/she can do to prevent it, nor can he/she attack you back.  I really PO&#039;ed my neighbor to the left as I only had (3) farms, and he would loose a City or Legion whenever it was my turn as I could seldom pay the tribute.

[u]Positive[/u]:
The mounted board is nice, and I really like the cards.  The purchasing and production mechanics are good, especially the combos that can be had.

[u]Negative[/u]:
The box should have been smaller, and the board, although nice, could have been just a straight line (although it looks good, it serves no purpose other than as a component place holder and a race track).  The wooden blocks are too small.</comment>	<conditiontext>Game is in Excellent condition (near mint), only played twice.  Complete.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A lot of difficult choices to make, as you may use a card in multiple ways.

As per the suggestion in the rules, play your first game without using the abilities conferred by the buildings, so you may grasp the &quot;flow&quot;.  In my first game I had a hard time selecting between Architect and Craftsman, as one allows you to play a card from your hand while the other is from the stockpile.

Definitely worth a few more tries as there are a lot of possible combos!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Game of Action maximization/management.  Essentially everyone is using resources (Spice, Ships and Colonists) to upgrade different aspect of his/her company, or colonize the four islands.  It is mostly a game of upgrades, where everything is intertwined.

Player interaction limited to the auction phase, and the board serves little purpose other than as a place holder for the cards...

Still, it can be an enjoyable experience with the right crowd.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Once you get past the badly written/organized rules, there is a good game in there.  A paragraph laying out the Turn Sequence and options available would have helped.

There are labels to apply (35), but this is fairly fast, especially if you&#039;ve done this for several hours with games such as [gameid=14015] and/or [gameid=87].

Play is fairly straightforward, and blocking other players is possible (on the Plantation board).  Apart from that, there is not much player interaction.  The player to your right may be able to limit your options depending on how he/she moves the &quot;Buyer&quot; piece (on the Production/Purchase board).

If using the blockading rules for scoring, the game may appear pointless as it is possible that no points get scored until three quarters of the game has been played.  Yet, blockading is not that bad of a rule once you&#039;ve played the game a few times.</comment>	<conditiontext>Mint, in original shrink-wrapping.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is a light &quot;party&quot; game.  It is always fun to see the other players try to act out their cards, but it may be difficult to do so yourself!  Each turn, a player draws 4 cards, decides which portion of the card (top or bottom) he/she would like to do (each section is worth different points, usually 1 for the top and 3 for the bottom (blue cards), or 2 for the top and 4 for the bottom (red cards).  The player then places the cards in the order he/she wishes, on top of the director&#039;s board, then starts the timer.  If your team is not fast enough to call out the proper word, the card drops into the device and you can&#039;t score points for it.  On the other hand, if the word is guessed, then the player needs to remove the card ASAP, before it drops, else no points are scored.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Was not impressed during my first game, but still picked up a copy in a Math-Trade.  I am not disappointed, as it is a light filler which is quick and easy to play.  There are some interesting combos, and it is possible to affect other players with card play.

Do take the time to read the action cards.  If the players get into the game, it can be quite funny.

Unfortunately, I am not a fan of PVP, which this game seems to be built around.  Further, there is too much counting of DEF and OFF points.

Cards are nice, and stacking them works well to count the stats... but there is just too much counting to make this fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Same engine as DC Comics and the LotR DBG from the same publisher.

Per the LotR games, the theme is well rendered, and minor tweaks in Characters, card types and Villain/Enemy deck, changes the game slightly.

Does it justify adding yet another copy in your collection?  Maybe not, but if you&#039;re into LotR, why not, the images are nice, and there is a mention that the games can be combined.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Nice components, like the combat system.  First game was a lot longer then expected.

I had to keep referring to the rulebook to determine if I could play a card or not; an image and/or color of units could have been added to the cards.  Needs a player aid showing the various unit names as well as the name of each (color) faction (Khorne, etc.)

Hero&#039;s Space Marine color not obvious (I had trouble distinguishing between blue and purple).

Timing is everything here, and game requires at least a second play.  (Rating will probably go up 1)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Game suffers from the &quot;snowball&quot; effect.   Once a player has gained momentum, stoping him/her alone is not possible.

Once someone has gained control of a neutral, it&#039;s way too easy for them to develop it.

Bash-The-Leader appears to be the best method to use to slow him/her down.  If you&#039;re in the lead, screwing up your move is the best thing you can do, in order to drop a spot or two...

Best strategy is to let other players take care of the leader while you attempt to go for the win by sailing in from 2nd or 3rd place.

Each power has a special ability and a disability.  Some of them make little sense, like Capitalism not being allowed to declare war.

Each player&#039;s deck is limited to 45 cards, which is an attempt to reduce the snowball effect, IMHO.  Once you are at 10 points, you need to discard most if not all of your influence in other countries in order to concentrate on the 2-3 you control.

The rulebook is built around the turn order, which means you need to read the rules twice, as the first pass will provide you with info which should have been explained before the Turn Order Sequence.

The game is too pricey for the quality of the components, which are almost as thin as paper.  As the 1 thru 6 counters were too difficult to pick up, we swapped them out for dice...

Essentially, this is a card game which could have done without the counters and paper map.

The Peace/Neutral/War diagram is cool, but would have been easier to read as an X-Y table (someone has uploaded one here!)

On the positive side, the turn order is well thought out.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Played with 5 and enjoyed it.  This is an advanced Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with 8 different card types.  The best defensive card is the Catapult, but it&#039;s worth 0 points, while the most useless offensive card is the Hoplite, which becomes the most potent, point wise, when you stack them in a Phalanx.  You need to manage your hand in order not to overextend by playing too many cards, as all you get between rounds is 3 new cards.

The theme feels right for this one, and the other 4 players enjoyed it as well.  Definately one we will be playing again!  And the artwork is pretty good too.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>An interesting take on ANTIKE, but more complex.  The action &quot;wheel&quot; is still present, and works similarly, although there is one spot which triggers the Investment sub-phase whenever a Country Action Token moves on or over it!

Each player will be playing two roles during the game.  That of an Investor, purchasing Bonds from the various Countries, and that of a Government, deciding when to tax, produce units, move/attack as well as when to pay dividends.

Managing both of these can be difficult, as players may purchase Bonds on any Country, and the player with the most Bonds (total) forms the new Government (i.e. controls that Country).

Initially players may have difficulties as to where the money is placed.  When a Country plays the Tax action, the money generated, if any, gets added to that Country&#039;s treasury.  When the Country pays it&#039;s inventors, the money is taken from the Country&#039;s Treasury and paid to the players holding Bonds.

So you&#039;ll be spending your money investing in different Countries, which you can be certain will change hands more than once during the game.  In the end, it is the player with the most money (cash on hand   value of all Bonds) who wins.

Although I rated this a &#039;7&#039;, I think my rating will go up after a few more plays.</comment>				</item>

Got the impression that once behind I could not catch up to the leader as generating income is very difficult.  Played with two other players.  Would probably be better with 4.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Really like the way the game plays, and the elegance and simplicity of the system.

Mind you the first few games may appear to be chaotic, until you learn what it is you need to do!

GET 5 different colored cards out ASAP, and splay, but don&#039;t neglect the dogma effects, as some are pretty good!!

It would be best to have a majority in at least one icon category, least you give your opponents an opportunity to act when it is not their turn.  ;)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A lot of rules to learn for the first play.    Requires a few turns to get into, but is relatively easy to play once thru the motions.

May be long for some as our first game took 4 hours and we still were not done.  Too much negotiating, not enough revolutions.

Do expect a lot of randomness as the card draw might not be in your favor.  You could have 1 vote for most of the game while everyone else has 6-12.

The revolution sub-game can be interesting as people switch sides at the start, during and at the end of this part of the game.

Needs to be played with the right type of people.

The French (Edition Descartes) version has a nicer board and counters, but the cards and money are much better with the English (West End Games) edition.

There are some differences in the rules as well, such as no initial attack in the English version when an enemy unit(s) enters your sector.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>There is more game here than meets the eye! Gameplay is balanced, regardless of the fact that one rolls 3d6 at each production phase.  The die rolls act as a limit to your actions, as you can get from 1 to 3 &quot;rewards&quot; each turn.  The bonus &quot; 2&quot; markers and the Farm&#039;s extra white die work very well in this system.

During our first 4-player game, two players had not focused on scoring victory points, thus the spread was large.  The second game saw a result of 36-35-35-32, with the player in last having dropped from 37 due to failing a combat against the dreaded Dragon.

Feels like a mix of ROMA, adding multiplayer capabilities, and CAYLUS, where resource management is key.  Player interaction (i.e. blocking) is limited to the die placement on the Influence board.  Players can build what they want on their &quot;land&quot; (board), assuming they have the required resources, and follow the building &quot;tree&quot; (which is very straight forward).  The rules are easy to learn, and the game can be thought quickly.

This may just be the best light Euro in my collection!</comment>				</item>

The game components looked good, and although I watched the other 3 players, the game simply did not look fun.  And when asked if they liked the game, the other players simply said that &quot;something appears to be missing&quot;.

Will most likely be giving this one another go to see if we did something wrong, but it came across as a nice looking bad game.</comment>				</item>

The cattle hurding and trying to increase their value appears to be too light, as the focus is geared more towards trying to slow down, steal from or hinder your opponents.

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>Rating after 10 games, averaging about 60 minutes per game.

Will undoubtedly be the best DBG of 2014.

Game mat comes with the game; finally someone who understands the advantage of a mat over a board!

The first scenario was the most difficult for us, and our sweet spot was to add 1 Drone card per player +1.

A great enhancement on the Legendary system!!  Mechanically flawless, scales well, enjoyable, and brimming with theme.

The &quot;coordination&quot; mechanic adds to the Coop nature of the game.  You are picking up cards which will assist your teammates, and playing one on their turn is necessary more often than not.

The added need to scan for enemies really adds to this game, and plays well with the theme.  Once in the Combat Zone, you get attacked by each enemy present.  Nice!

Giving the &quot;3&quot; strength Sergeants &quot;Coordinate&quot; and a Character Class is brilliant!  Even low cost cards give you pause for consideration, depending on how you want to structure your deck.

Wounds do not clutter your deck, they accumulate besides your character until you are eliminated.  Player elimination is mitigated by the Alien player additional rule, which essentially ensures the game will end much quicker, so you can start a new one.  ;)

Although a 10 strength Alien is frightening, the worst enemy is the darn Facehugger!! &quot;Ok, before scanning, be sure to keep at least 3 attack points in case you reveal a Facehugger !!!&quot;


Only negative thing I can find... The name on each card indicating which deck they belong to is way too small... for me anyways.

At least one person I know picked up a copy with 50 duplicate cards...  A slight assembly error, which the publisher immediately recognized and advised would be sending the missing cards (within the next 3 weeks).

Looking forward to trying this with the traitor rules!! The added angst must be exhilarating!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting euro game.  You need to manage your resources, which in this case also include your workers.  Should they be assigned to the lab where they can speed up the research on the various trinkets, or sent to town to pick up resources or special items.

I really bungled my first attempt at this one (bad strategy - did not know what to expect), and am willing to give it another go.  Everything is important in this one, and you need to keep a close eye on the competition.</comment>	<conditiontext>2006 Mayfair Edition - still in shrink wrapping.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Played two 4-player games with a single copy of the game (we took two Threat counters from another game), and the game played rather well.  As we were all learning the cards, the games were a bit slower, but that was to be expected.

That said, I really liked the flow.  Although there are quite a few steps, they become intuitive after a game or two.

The game is interesting, cards are nice, price is acceptable, and it is not a collectable, which all add up to an 8.  Rating may change after a few more games, but I am already looking forward to the expansion(s), so we can start building our decks.

Looking forward to seeing where FFG intends to go with this.</comment>				</item>

Like the fact that there are several deck reducing cards available, and the DEF cards have different effects.  Really enjoy things like Frodo&#039;s use of the Ring card will has a chance of giving him a Corruption card.

Prefer this to it&#039;s DC COMICS predecessor.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is a thinking game, as you try to gain mission tokens by gaining the favor (majority of influence tokens) of a member of the court.  Influence placement mechanic is quite interesting, and the game has many subtleties.  Good reply value!

There is a bit of luck with the influence cards you are dealt, but this is practically negated since you have the option of moving influence tokens to an adjacent character, not to mention that you always have an extra influence card (therefore you will be discarding the least valuable).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Not for the faint of heart!  An (Action) Cube management game!

It can be quite challenging to plan for the activation of cards when you have no control when, nor how many, cubes of the right color will come out!

Single color cards are easier to plan for, two colors doable but more difficult, but 3 and 4 colors?  You really need to plan 5-6 turns ahead for those, and hope the right numbered dies come up, or you have a Joker token or have already activated card(s) which provide you with a cube of the needed color(s).

With this said, it is possible to, or should I say necessary, to go for card combos.  And there are many possibilities.

Not all cards will come up during a game, so there is a lot of replay value.  At the same time, there is a fair amount of randomness (cards, action cube die rolls), which is somewhat mitigated by the fact that there are more than one copy of a card, albeit with different resource costs.  Further, there are always 2 extra cards during the card selection phase, so even the last player will have a choice out of 3 cards.

All in all an interesting game, but somewhat of a brain burner when it comes to planning ahead.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A light-medium game which has a clean mechanic.  There is a bit of &quot;take that&quot; (Coffee and purple buildings).  Players gradually build up their Town, and the first to complete the construction of 4 pre-set buildings (everyone has the same 4) wins.

There is some randomness, but it can be mitigated by the cards you purchase, which trigger on different numbers, and may or not not trigger on other players turns.

A nice filler to end a game day, or while you wait for players to arrive.  30-45 minutes.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Looking for the ENGLISH edition.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A rather light game, somewhat similar to NAVAL BATTLES.  Easy to teach and play, but heavily dependant on card draw.  Most probably better with more players.  Some of the card drawings are funny/cute.  Game does not appear to have anything to do with the TI universe (thought I had read that somewhere).  Willing to give this one another try, with 4 or more players.</comment>	<conditiontext>Shrink</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A Political, Economic and light wargame of many subtleties.  Each Empire starts off with a slight advantage in one area.  Winning usually requires finess, in this most excellent game!

Initially, everyone races to increase their economies via the building of Caravans and Markets.  Once these tokens have all been bought, players start increasing their military, which they hope to use in order to &quot;help&quot; with their Diplomacy  :)

All battles (ground and naval) are resolved by rolling 1d6 per unit, totaling the result, then dividing by 5 to determine the number of enemy units destroyed.

The game&#039;s winner is usually the player who has played the best political game, or the one who has managed to put everyone to sleep and then builds the coveted Pyramid wonder!

The game is best played with 5, and is still Ok with 4.  Unfortunately, it does not work too well with only 3.  

A 3-player scenario (Triumvirate) has been published.  Rating adjusted due to 3-player scenario!</comment>	<conditiontext>Mint in original shrink wrapping - ENGLISH version

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Nice quality components, but only an Ok game.  The premise is interesting, and generally the game plays well.

Unfortunately, the &quot;Conflict&quot; resolution provides an advantage to the leader, an advantage that one cannot easily remove or negate.

The person with a Military advantage can steal, every turn, 1 resource from any player who does not match him.  This is not too bad, but then there is the Military Conflict event, which allows one player to steal ALL the resources from another player.  Further, once the Military Supremacy event card comes up, he gets to retain it, which allows him to steal half the resources from one player every turn.

The problem with this is that the only way to effectively counter a Military superiority is by building a Military building, or having the Bunker R&amp;D card (there is only 1, drawn randomly).  Since the Military superiority allows the player to steel resources, it is extremely difficult to counter as you seldom have the resources required to build what you&#039;d like to, let alone a military building.

As it turned out, it&#039;s a catch-22 for one player, as it turns into a bash-the-player-in-last-place to steel the 1 or 2 resource cards he has.  After all, one needs resources to build, thus why not steal from another player each turn?

Although I love resources management games, the &quot;conflict&quot; mechanic in this one is what killed it from me.  I will probably try this again, knowing that at least one player will not have a good time, as he won&#039;t be able to build, let alone catch up to the rest of the group.

	<numplays>28</numplays>			<comment>A &quot;light&quot; wargame which can be appreciated by grognards and beginners alike.

Played with 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 players (using a single copy of the game).  Also tried with 8 players using two copies of the game.  It was quite enjoyable, regardless of the number of players, as downtime is kept to a minimum.

Rulebook, mapboard, soft plastic units, counters and terrain tiles are of excellent quality (artilery pieces are a little thin).

Doublesided mounted mapboard with (2) isomorphic sides which allows for expansion of the battlefield by combining multiple copies of the game.

Game requires 10-15 minutes setup time (terrain tile and unit placement).  Use of a Plexiglas to hold the tiles in place is recommended, but not necessary.

Card holders are a GREAT addition, as I used these with other card games!!  :)

Card activation system minimizes &quot;down time&quot; and lends itself well to team play (players commanding one or more sectors of the battlefield --&gt; Left/Center/Right).

Combat is resolved using special combat dice (8 are provided).  One seldom rolls more than 4 dice, so no dicefest here.

Game comes with 16 scenarios, each playable in 30-60 minutes.  Quick playing time allows for &quot;round robin&quot; type play.

Excellent game support offered via web site (here too!) as well as excellent customer service from Days of Wonder!

I liked the game and support so much I picked up a second copy!

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An excellent pick-up-and-deliver type game.  Sure there is some randomness to your movement, but this beats drawing event cards.  The resupplying mechanic works really well, as a route you&#039;ve established may run dry (again random, but recreating uncertainty).

Although the game appears to start slowly, it does pick up speed as you generate more income.  I am looking forward to playing again, perhaps with some of the advanced rules (like combat).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Ultra simplistic.  Needs better rules as it boils down to whom rolls the highest.  Fighters have a rating from 2 - 4, which dictates how many dice you roll for them.  Payload can be either Air-to-Air (+1 to a die) or Air-to-Sea.  If you loose the die tosses for both your 4 rated fighters, the game becomes very difficult.  In our first game, I lost my two &#039;4&#039; fighters, the first to bad die rolls, and the second to a lucky die roll from the opponent (his &#039;2&#039; rated fighter armed with AA rolled a 6, which turned into a 7, thus defeating my roll of 6-6-6-6...  Quite annoying, considering the odds.  All this to say that lady luck plays a big role.  
The components are very nice, but not really worth the asking price.  If you like tweaking rules, this game has some potential.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A quick playing game of strategy and deduction.  One player tries to eliminate suspects, while the other tries to move the pieces to make the first player&#039;s task more difficult.

Game pieces are of excellent quality!  There was a problem when they cut the cards as the card&#039;s color is visible on the sides (a bad thing).  They suggest placing the deck in the box so the side is not visible.  This solution works quite well.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A set collecting game, where one collect cards by placing pawns in different markets.  The market mechanic is new (to me), as a certain number and/or placement of pawns will trigger the closing of the market, which allows the owner of the pawn in the highest numbered slot to pay that price to get first pick (top card in the market + a favor, or two cards in the lower row).  The next pawn owner, in numerical order, has the option of taking half the money in the market, rounded up, or purchasing a card for the price his/her pawn is on.  This continues until all player pawns have had a chance to act.

With the favors, players are able to activate special cards, which will help them in scoring victory points.  At the end of the game, each card is worth a value, based on the number of different players who own that type of card.  The more owners there are, the less a card is worth.

An interesting system, but something appears to be missing, as there could be more then just set collecting.  Then again, perhaps my expectations are too high.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Light game where you face off against an opponent (or 2 pairs of players).  Each hand is played against a single opponent, the winner moving the puck up the ice as per the instructions on the last card played.

When in the shooting zone, hand winner determines if it is a goal or a save.

Your 5-card hand is refilled only when there is a stoppage in play or you run out of cards.

Duration: 30-45 minutes</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Friend got it in a bargain bin @ $25.
Nice components, interesting game play

Played twice.
Too long for what it is.
Next to impossible to win as the guards, as even if you kill both opponents, if it&#039;s before turn #9, they come back...What&#039;s the point?
To help the guards, if you did not draw an attack card, you can&#039;t do anything even if you find the opponents.  Really?
Don&#039;t intend to play this again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This one is difficult to describe, it is a game of card taking and passing, as each card taken is worth x points, and the person with the lowest total wins.  Only the lowest number in a sequence is counted, so 19,18, 17 is only worth 17 points.  Each player starts with 11 tokens, which can be used to pass (&quot;no thanks&quot;), with the person taking the card also taking the tokens which were placed on it to pass.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Fairly easy to play, but may take some time to master.  There are three different types of pieces, which can move 1, 2 or 3 spaces (depends on the size/height of the piece).  Each of these may move/push up to 1, 2 or 3 pieces, again depending on the size/height.  The first person to push off the board 7 points worth of pieces from his/her adversary wins.  And you guessed it, each piece is worth 1, 2 or 3 points, based on it&#039;s size/height.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Talk about a short game!  45 minutes?  Actually took us 20-25 minutes with 5-players.  Perhaps we were doing something wrong?  When it&#039;s your turn you buy/sell stocks (optional), advance the purple pawn around the board (1-3 spaces) and do what is on that space.There is not much game here, as is it feels like the game has not been completed.  There are much better games out there such as [GAMEID=433], even [GAMEID=2680] is better, IMHO.  I&#039;m rather disappointed in this one, although some players were already coming up with house rules to make the game better.

The dice: aren&#039;t we past the point where we have to apply stickers onto dice?  And there are six in this one...  I can see these labels waring/peeling off fairly quickly.

The four modular &quot;L&quot; which make up the board&#039;s contour is interesting, as it allows the board&#039;s layout to change from game to game, but players often moved the board (accidentally) and it seems we kept replacing these sections.  Perhaps a &quot;puzzle&quot; type approach would have been better?

On the positive side, the stock tokens are a good size, and the thickness is excellent!

[u]Edit[/u]: Upped rating from 3 to 6 after my gaming partner suggested each move be 1 or 2 squares instead of up to 3.  It made the game way more interesting and less chaotic.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Family game, easy to learn and play.  Nice components.  May be a bit pricey for what you get.

The Action/Dexterity must be for the rush to not be the last one to grab a truck once they are revealed...  It&#039;s more family friendly when you play with the optional rule which allows you to choose a truck off the table when you are last; takes a few seconds longer, but gives the 3D challenged players a better chance.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>I like coop games, and this one lends itself well to it.  Trying to maximize the entire team&#039;s play may be overwhelming for some, who may think the other players are playing for them.  Truth is, players should make recommendations as to what they think the optimal moves are, else this may just has well be a one player game.  With this being said, I liked the game and the folks I played it with, thus I had a good experience and would play it again.

The components are nice, and the epidemic mechanic, where the discard deck is added to the top of the draw deck works great, giving the feel of an epidemic/outbreak.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is an empire building game with a risk management component.  I must say I was surprised how balanced the game could be, as I had the impression the random events had taken me out of the game on three occasions, yet I was one turn away from winning at the end of the third year.

The Island Trading aspect reminds me of CIV, as it&#039;s open and everyone tries to trade for the resources he/she needs.  Planning and the ability to think on your feet pays dividends here.

One must take advantage of the Surplus and Shortages which are occuring on the board, but must also take into account if these are occuring at a neighboring land or further away, as the number of event cards doubles.

Rating is based on a single play.  I am looking forward to trying this one again as my rating will most likely go up!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Nice quality components, love the reduction in interest of previous/older exhibits.

Game requires $$ to do anything, and if you are unlucky, can lead to a pretty boring game.  You need to predict what the other players need, how much cash they will most likely require to pick the item up, and you&#039;ll have to try to predict how much cash will be available.  More likely then not, someone will play before you and get the cash and the item, then you are left not doing much of anything for the turn...  If there are a few rounds with low income, the game drags...

Too long for what it is, and too random when it comes to $$, which is absolutely required if you want to dig for relics.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Easy to learn and fast playing game.  Players select which island they are going to and combat occurs if more than one player goes to the same island.  Only one player gets to collect the booty (listed on a card) for each island.  Nice components.  Played many 4 and 5 player games.  The addition of an extra Pirate ship should make the game scale well with three players, as it limits ones choices.  The 4-player game is what I prefer to date.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Knowledge of the rules of football is not required in this relatively simple game.  The pieces are of good quality, and &quot;pitching&quot; the tokens works really well as the playing surface provides more friction, therefore one has more control.

The rules are a tad ambiguous, and I&#039;d like to read them again before deciding to purchase this one or not, although I am very tempted to pick this up!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>This is a fast playing dexterity game.  Players may position their &quot;car&quot; to &quot;snooker&quot; you, so there is more strategy then meets the eye.

Unless you&#039;re really bad at dexterity games, it&#039;s always possible to come back from behind to win!

A game can be played in about 15-20 minutes with 4-6 players.  This is a big plus, especially when compared to other more detailed games which take 2-3 hours to play.

Last but not least, it&#039;s a game the whole family can play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>All the rules of (North American) Football are there, except for penalties.  Come on, it would not have been too difficult to implement.

As for gameplay, you don&#039;t really get a feeling that you are usefull when playing on Defense, as even if you guess the right play, all it provides is perhaps a minus 1 modifier if you rolled high enough, or a -2 if you rolled 2 or 12 (on 2d6).

As is, this is more of a solo game than anything else.  Perhaps it would be easy to come up with house rules so that the defensive player would get an immediate modifier for selecting the correct counter-play.

If the offensive player rolls well, there is absolutely nothing the defensive player can do.  By the same token, if the offensive player rolls badly (less then 10 on 3d6), there is nothing the defense needs to do.

On the positive side, the components are of good quality, and I especially like the fact that the reference cards are laminated.

There are better games on the subject out there, including AH&#039;s PAYDIRT!, which was released in the late 70&#039;s-early 80&#039;s.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Provides minor modifications to the generic/base cross-reference chart, with teams having a slight modifier for Run, Short Pass and/or Long Pass type plays, but providing an extra die to roll (one takes the higher of two die when his team has an advantage in that specific type of play, or the lower of the two when it has a disadvantage).

The expansion does add 3 more plays, or rather one extra play per type of play (Run/Draw, Short Pass/Screen, Long Pass/Play Action).  These in turn provide the defensive player with a slight improvement in usefulness, as if he guesses the play right, he has an increased chance of affecting the offense&#039;s die roll, by providing a -1 modifier.

Still, the defensive player&#039;s role in the game is very minimal, as his guessing the correct counter play does not impact the game all that much.  If the Offensive player rolls high (10  on 3d6), there is absolutely nothing the defensive player can do, unless he rolls 10  on 2d6 AND guesses the correct counter-play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Of the negative comments I have read here, I agree there are typos, the tokens/counters are a little small, and the rulebook could have been better organized, but apart from that, this is a pretty decent game.

Played 3 games in a row, 4-player configuration without the dirty cop.  We lost the first two, and one the last one, on the very last turn and player action of the game!

The theme is well integrated, there is some randomness which can be mitigated by player cooperation.

Downtime is limited, as you can always interact/assist with the active player.

Game is fairly simple to learn, and pretty well balanced right out of the box.

The sweetspot appears to be a 4-player configuration, since adding more player reduces the over # of turns, and increases the time between turns.

Components are of good to medium quality, except for the crime track and evidence boards, which are too thin (and start warping as soon as you open the box).

With the variable setup, the game is different enough to make it an interesting puzzle to solve.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The BeNeLux board with is minor rules modifications is the best one I have played so far.  Game time is also reduced to about 90 minutes, given the removal of the lowest rank Power Plant every turn (which we had forgotten to do!)

It needs a small player aid/reminder, which could be placed on the board somewhere, for the first session or two.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Did not like the added disadvantage the leading player has when selecting an item from the market.  Essentially, you have to select something no one else wants, which is counter-intuitive.

Random board and tribesman placement is Ok, but does not make up for the lack of control the leading player has due to dwindling food supply, which is again counter-intuitive unless you start calculating what everyone else can get in order to know how much you will have...

Did not like this one, and will most likely not be playing it again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Pretty good game which includes bidding, and where one needs to manage his actions and resources.

The &quot;Tetris&quot; approach to placing buildings is quite interesting, and players are more tempted to pick up a 2nd Engineer to allow adjacent placement, else one runs out of room very quickly!

Very touch decision between collecting money for your Works, or getting Victory Points!  If a player mis-manages his/her resources (money), he/she may take themselves right out of the game.  Thus, need to pre-plan their next move(s).</comment>				</item>

Unfortunately, it was unclear to me how to achieve victory as I seemed to always be short on funds, even though a lot of the bids went to the first bidder (no one appeared to have money).  I have only played one game, and managed to come in first, although I am not sure how.  May have given it a better rating, although I am not sure I would like to play this one again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is a light party game which is a great Ice Breaker!  Can play up to 12-players, and would recommend a minimum of 5 or 6.

In a nutshell, one player reads one of 6 (?) questions one one of the cards, and everyone &quot;votes&quot; via their Yes/No card, which they place in the voting box, then everyone guesses how many &quot;Yes&quot; can be found.

Everyone who guessed exactly the number of yeses scores 2 points.  If there are no exact guess(es), then everyone who is within &quot;1&quot; of the number of Yesses scores 1 point.

First player to 10 points is the winner.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Looking for ballot box version.

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>I like the concept, but the in game execution is iffy as you are rolling dice after all...

Attacking everyone simultaneously takes care of the bash the leader issue the game could have, but at the same time prevents weaker players from catching up.

I&#039;ve seen 3-player games were we&#039;d like to stop the leader, but roll nothing useful to attack with, and the game ends with scores of 2-2-15, which gives the impression there is a runaway leader issue.

After several additional plays, I have increased my rating to 5.5, but the runaway leader issue is flagrant, especially when someone gets one of the more expensive die at the start (such as the dragon).

Would like to try one or two of the expansions to see if it resolves any of the above issues, else I don&#039;t see the rating going any higher.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Tried one game, only played 3-4 turns, but had enough.  It&#039;s a light combat game with a Fantasy component (Quest).  The Quest part apears interesting, but somehow not feel right for this type of game.  Counting territories each time to figure out how much income one receives is just too long.  Having one player go through all 7 steps creates a lot of down time in a four player game (5 minutes per player per turn).  Then again, this should come down once the players get accustomed to the rules, etc.  I would be willing to give this one another try, but my first impression is not all that good, unfortunately.

Was there supposed to be a Mana marker?  We ended up using one of the white markers.  The cards where not the same size with about a quarter being wider than the rest.  My copy was missing 1 red foot unit.

On the bright side, the Def/Att rating idea is interesting, in that your attack rating is what you need to roll (or less) to hit, while the defense rating of your target defines the dice type you need to roll (6 = 1d6, 12 = 1d12, etc.).

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>A fairly straightforward bidding game where everyone&#039;s possible bids are in plain view (each player has 3 numbered bidding tiles).

One tries to make different sets in order to score points, or avoid loosing points.

Better with 4-player than only 3, IMHO.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Has a CCG feel in that cards can/should be used in combos.  There is little player interaction, other than the fact that you all draw from the same deck, and that the action you select (out of 7 or 8 choices) also allows the other players to do it (minus the bonus, a-la Puerto Rico).  Cost to &quot;build/activate&quot; a card is done a-la San Juan, where you need to discard a card.

An interesting combination of mechanics, and a relatively fast playing game (under an hour).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I was looking forward to trying this one, but the movement is too close to MONOPOLY for me (roll 1d6 and move x spaces left or right).  In 2013?  Really??

Played a 4-player game and it was a waste of 3-hours of my life.  No fun, no enjoyment, no control.

After 2 hours, managed to lose the only 4 points/trophy I had accumulated... and after 3 hours, still had not gained a level.  Other players were passing their tests, I was failing more than half of them.

The board was nice but too &quot;loud&quot;.

Nice sculpts.

Will never play this again.</comment>				</item>

The advanced cards add to the experience, and make the game more playable.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Rating based on a single attempt with 5-players, none of which had played before.  I will definitely be trying this one again, when I have had the time to re-read the rules (and print a player aid).

Given the level of detail in the sequence of play (20 or so phases in each turn!), I suspect there is a good game here, but it is not for the faint of heart.  If you are not ready to invest a good chunk of time, do not attempt to play this one.

The conflict resolution mechanic stems from Civilization.</comment>				</item>

The &quot;card set&quot; mechanic unbalances the game, IMHO, as each set is worth more than the previous, and the last player to hand in a set has the upper hand.  It&#039;s easy to play king maker, and the winner is often decided 1 hour before the game actually ends.</comment>				</item>

Nice components, although some tokens should have been cards (ie. discovery tokens).

Excellent support by the author on this site.

One of the best coop games out there.

Learning curse may be steep for the first game, as there are lot of different tokens and cards.  After one play, everything should be clear, as the system becomes intuitive.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>This is a good game if you&#039;re interested in adding a little spice (and chaos) to your evening.  &quot;Programming&quot; your bot is fairly straight forward, provided you have been passed the cards you need (if you didn&#039;t get any left turns, you may have to turn right a few times to get your bot to point in the right direction).

I liked the simultaneous moves and the special ability cards, but the game is a tad too long, random and chaotic for my tastes, so I sold my copy.  YMMV.

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>Fairly straight forward two player game, which is a bit heavier than the standard fare filler game.  I like the (random) way your 3 actions are determined, and the game is just the right length for what it is.

Unfortunately, if your opponent keeps rolling high and you roll low, it can be quite difficult to win.

I have yet to win a single game when I have the Merchant.  The Gladiator on the opponent&#039;s side can be quite frustrating, especially when you have nothing to counter it.  :(</comment>				</item>

The game can be frustrating as you only have 1 minute (or 90 seconds?) to build a structure, and the slightest bump against the table will bring your stack crumbling down.

When you play this, please ensure the table is sturdy enough to withstand a bump, else everyone&#039;s structure will collapse.</comment>				</item>

With the expansion [gameid=124300], the included coop is more enjoyable.

As a versus game, it is probably good, as each race has it&#039;s strengths and weaknesses.

Each race feels and plays very differently!  Typical Corey Konieczka goodness!  :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s an interesting game, which can also be played solo.  I really liked the movement dice idea, with multiple icons per side, allowing you to enter one area per dice with the appropriate terrain icon.

The game itself is fairly straightforward, although the game&#039;s time clock (monsters killed) really forces you to forge ahead.  If you waste any time, you will not survive the final battle!

Oh yeah, there are a gazillion expansions for it, from new adventures to new monsters, to new items and treasures.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is a good game.  It&#039;s a light adventure game where the player controls a party of 1 to 3 characters (1 Hero and up to 2 Allies).

The combat is pretty straight forward, as players add 2d10 with their ability rating, and compare that number with the creatures rating.  This may easily become monotonous.

The market mechanic is interesting, as players visit towns where they may purchase items, hire allies, pay to recoup stamina and/or health, not to mention sell items (for half price).

The players control which ability of his/her Hero will be upgraded when he/she reaches the next experience level (required XP varies based on number of players).

The XP provided by creatures varies depending on the deck it came from: Green = 1, Yellow = 2, Blue = 3 and Red = 4.

The game may appear to be long at first when you are learning to play, but it quickly becomes intuitive.  Even Player versus Player combat is pretty easy.

Adding expansions will be rather straight forward, so there is no need to worry about replayability.  Creative players could easily design their own adventures, creatures and items!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This expansion includes a new adventure deck, which has more quests.  It makes the game more interesting, to me anyways.

There are still a few things I don&#039;t like, such as the experience levels, which are a tad difficult to achieve initially, then are too easy/fast later in the game.  The game clock using the Doom Counters is also a feature I do not enjoy, yet I understand why it is part of the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A light and fast game of deduction, based on a set of displayed cards; one has to find his/her way to the (right) ship using the color coded Crow&#039;s Nest, Sails, Hull or Name Plate.  The faster you are to get to your seat (the ship where your crew members ends up), the more gold you get.  After 5 rounds, the game ends.

The components are nice, but where&#039;s the fun?  It is as entertaining as watching paint dry.  Would have rated a &#039;1&#039;, but since this mathematical puzzle is not &#039;broken&#039;, I had to give it a &#039;2&#039;.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This game came across as an advanced GOA, where you need to manage your &quot;funds&quot; (magic dust and power/cash?) in order to upgrade your different skills in 6 (?) different abilities/books.  Essentially, you are trying to build up your capital so you can afford the better items (VP and/or bonuses) and gems (cash).

When a player selects an artifact, a round of bidding is conducted until everyone passes.

There are a lot of cardboard pieces in this one, as those are used to represent your magic dust as well as your money/power.  And you keep collecting and spending/returning those all the time.  A tad too tedious for my tastes.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Have been wanting to play this one for some time, and was able to play a 6-player game with experienced players (I was the only newbie).

A nice game of Diplomacy, with better mechanics and good looking components.

I especially liked the combat resolution system, which I prefer over a similar (but a tad more complex) game of Wallenstein/Shogun.  But there is no reason (other than prohibitive cost!) to not have colored the combat dice, as we were constantly asking which color those icons represented!

Hidden runaway leader problem, with one player going from last place with 28 points, and scoring a whopping 68 points in a single turn (game ends when a player passes 60 points), outscoring 2nd place by 30+ points...  I guess everyone else simply missed a good game....  (Score: 96, 63, 62, 61, 58, 57)

And for the life of me, why would anyone not wait until the last turn to cash in their Hanafuda cards?

This is actually a set collecting game, set in Medieval Japan with a War/Diplomacy sub-game, similar to IMPERIALISM (where stocks is where the game&#039;s at.. in this case it is set collecting cards).

House Rule: Only one set of cards is allowed to be &quot;cashed&quot; in per turn.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Increased rating from 6.5 to 7.0.
I tend to enjoy playing the simpler characters (Tempest), while my gaming group enjoy the more complicated ones.

Game becomes fairly intuitive after a few plays.  We assign  one player to handle the Villain and Environment decks.

Sorting the tokens/markers helps.

Decks are pre-built, so you get right into the action.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A fast playing (light) trading game set in the Mediterranean.  Combat is possible between ships as well as amphibious landings.  Movement is cleverly limited by the number of sailors on each ship, with each sailor taking up one cargo hold.  The more sailors the less cargo, but the faster the ship may move.  Game ends after a set number of turns.  This can be varied using an optional rule.  Although fast playing, I find it too short.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>51</numplays>			<comment>Played over 40 times.

Played with 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 players.  The game scales really well, not to mention players can enter or leave the game at any time, thus removing the need of running a filler while waiting for late arrivals.

In order to experience this game at its fullest, it is critical one aderes to the rules in that no specific information is provided.  General comments are fine, but no details can be provided.  Thus, &quot;I can fight the Dragon but cannot defeat it&quot; means that a player can play some cards but does not have all the cards required to win that Quest, thus help is needed.  What kind of help? (i.e. which cards?)  That&#039;s what can&#039;t be told.

The game can be difficult to win without a traitor, and can quickly become impossible to win when there is a traitor in your midst.  You must observe every player&#039;s actions in order to see if there is indeed a traitor.

During the &quot;Progression of Evil&quot; phase, the player has to choose between three options, all of which are bad, so picking the one which is least damaging to your cause can be nail biting!

When playing the Knight&#039;s action phase, you must try to maximize your EVERY move.  One wasted move can have nasty consequences.

Selflessness goes a long way as it can help another Knight, who in turn may be able to help you.

Since the priority of the different quests varies from game to game, there is a lot of replay value in here!  Each Knight&#039;s special ability mixes things up even more.

An awesome game!  Kudos to DoW for another winner!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>There is a lot going on here, and a few games are required to grasp, let alone rate this title.

As a 2-player game, there is a runaway leader issue, but it&#039;s OK if all you want to do is learn the game.

As a 3-player game, it&#039;s OK if all three players have relatively the same experience level (ie. a new player might be an easy target for a Military victory).

As a 4-player game, the players are the balancing factor and can mitigate a runaway leader.  The game is also more forgiving if you are relatively new to the game.

With multiple paths to victory, and a lot of options, this is an excellent game, although some might find it too long.

Expect Analysis Paralysis from new players.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Very nice pieces (except the plane and Battleship).  The City improvement card system works well.

Combat is very basic using a Rock-Paper-Scissors modifier system as well as a 1d6 x Epoch approach which makes epoch changes extremely drastic initially.

The Technology and Wonder mechanic does not work for me, as I have a major issue with having a 5gp payback to the player who discovered the relevant technology first, since it makes attacking him next to pointless since you are in fact subsidizing his war effort.  This is especially true in the first stages of the game as military units cost 10gp...

From what I have seen, whomever can pick up the technologies first will win the game, especially the military unit ones.

When a player is trailing, come backs are very difficult, which make these players easy targets for wealthier opponents.

Although I&#039;m sure there is a good game lying somewhere in here, I was unable to see it, unfortunately.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A resource management game, where you produce 3 types of commodities (Food, Hammers, Coins).  There are no dice, and the randomness of the card draws is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you draw 4 cards, then discard 2 from your entire hand.  You can still end up with cards you can&#039;t really use.

The &quot;terrain&quot; system revolves around &quot;Plot&quot; cards, which produce 2 resources, or 1-2 types.  You may allocate population on each resource, at the cost of 6,8, 10, etc. FOOD per population on the card, and they yield 1 additional resource this plot produces (your choice if there are 2).

Buildings and Wonders are built (Hammers) on the plots, 1 per card, 2 if you have 3 or more population on it.  You may purchase additional plots at the cost of 15, 20, 25, etc. resources (of any kind) from the available ones (3 are always displayed/available).

You may also purchase any number of Tech cards, using coins, and they give you a bonus of some sort, as well as 1VP.  The tech cards also act as the game clock; as soon as the last one is purchased, the game ends, and VPs are tallied up.  Wonder cards are the only other unit which have a VP value.

Like Settlers of Catan, there are two cards which one may control over the course of the game, and those are for the most &quot;Happy faces&quot; and &quot;Culture&quot;, and they provide a bonus to the current leading player.

Combat is simplistic but works.  Cards are rated for Offensive and/or Defensive action, and act in a rock-paper-scissor fashion.  As an example, Archers here are defensive only, but can counter any single opponent card.

You play 1 to n combat cards on your enemy, who then has the option to counter them one by one, as he/she chooses.  Non countered units execute their &quot;action&quot;, which can be anything from capturing a population to destroying a building (it returns to your hand).  Wonders cannot be destroyed, and plots are never stolen.

When there is a choice, the defender chooses which population or building is affected.

Played two-player and liked it (final score was 23 to 21), but think this would be better with 3 or 4, and I would be interested in trying the Team variation.

On the negative side, the game is too long for what it is, but if you are looking for a quick playing &quot;light&quot; Civilization game, this one is good.  After all, what&#039;s 1-2 hours compared to 12 for Advanced Civilization?  ;)

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A light &quot;party&quot; game which plays quickly.  Can only be played by folks who understand both French and English, as one needs to translate French words back to English (English words were initially translated directly to French, Ã  la Babblefish, which makes for a lot of nonsense).

When players cannot find the correct English words/translation, up to 2 clues are provided.  Here&#039;s an actual example:

&quot;Baton de joie&quot; Answer: Joystick
Clues were: Jeu vidÃ©o/Manette

When one translates &quot;BÃ¢ton de joie&quot; directly to English, one gets &quot;Stick of Joy&quot;, hence the totally hilarious aspect of the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Played a few sessions with some friends and found the game entertaining.  It&#039;s a bit more advanced then the old card game where one team would &quot;pass&quot; by playing the same numbered card as the other team, and a goal would be scored on the next &quot;play&quot; by playing another matching card.

In this one you need to &quot;move&quot; the puck from zone to zone by playing &quot;situation&quot; cards.  When in the offensive side of the ice but still in the neutral zone, a slap shot can be played, or a wrist shot when in the offensive zone.

Following play of each card the other team has the option of blocking play by playing an &quot;Interception&quot;, &quot;Off-side&quot;, &quot;Icing&quot;, &quot;Penalty&quot; or other similar cards.

Following a shot, the other team needs to play a &quot;Blocker&quot;, &quot;Trapper&quot; or &quot;Post&quot; card.

The game is fairly easy to teach and play, and comes with two difficulty levels.

The rules are a little lame as some questions remain unanswered.  Then again, I seem to have the first edition as my box is half the size of the one shown in the Image Gallery.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>42</numplays>			<comment>Very thematic, soundtrack adds to the gaming experience.  Robotic voice is easy to understand on DVD, and an MP3 file is available for download if you prefer using a PC.

We had two players sitting besides the DVD player, one would handle outside threats, the other inside threats.  Worked quite well, as the Communication Officer would repeat the information.

First time out we played [b]TEN[/b] 5-player games in a row (don&#039;t recall ever doing that before!), starting off with the intro games and moving up.  The self training approach was very nicely done.

Highly recommend this game if you are into coop games.  It is a cross between [GAMEID=18] and [GAMEID=12350], in the [GAMEID=31481] universe!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Combat required you roll =&gt; then a target # with 2d10.  Makes for very random results, which is good, except when one player is very lucky and the other unlucky.

Only played one game, where the US rolled nothing under 12 for his first five rolls, decimating the German units and scoring 32+ points.  Germans were unable to hit, even with a to hit number of 9 (rolled 8) until late in the game.

Mechanically the game is OK, although some rules are not clear; case in point, the rulebook has 3 pages of rules and a page of diagrams, and there is a 6 page FAQ...

Cards are good quality and iconography is easy to follow.

Dislikes (apart from random combat):

Sleeved cards will not fit in the original box.

US has mobile artillery (M3 Priest) Germans have none...  Find the game unbalanced, advantaging the US.

Simultaneous target selection and commitment of units were sticking points with my opponent, but it didn&#039;t impact any of my decisions (either I was going to place a unit or I wasn&#039;t, same with target selection, so mechanically this should be fine).</comment>				</item>

Beware of rules lawyers if you play with several of the expansions.  I&#039;d recommend staying away from these as they don&#039;t add all that much to the game.  The entire rules with the expansion is several hundread pages of 8Â½ x 11 inch paper...  Come on, it can&#039;t be THAT complex.

Then again, if you&#039;re a die hard, then the expansions are a must.

	<numplays>90</numplays>			<comment>After 75+ games...

For the price, this is a good game.

It may appear light at first, but there are myriad combos and multiple paths to victory.

Unfortunately, it being a card/deck building game, there is still a sizable luck factor.  Will you have the resources to buy those big cards, or will the big cards be available when you have the resources?  Will the combos come out together, or in different hands?

Team play looks promising, but requires the purchase of an extra game per two players.

If you like light-medium and fast playing deck building games, it would be a good addition to your collection, as a game can be completed in 20-30 minutes, and it has a relatively small foot print.

If you despise randomness, there may be just a bit too much here you.

But you may try before you buy, as the game is available as a free download for most platforms!  So you can learn how to play versus the (easy) computer AI.</comment>				</item>

Components are nice, but the &quot;Energize&quot; cards are a tad thin, but the &quot;web&quot; coating helps.  Counters and especially the mission cards are made of thick cardboard.

Game play wise, I&#039;m not sure.  The mechanic seems Ok, but something does not seem to jive.  The space combat is more or less pointless, as unless you get lucky with the die roll, and the Klingon die does not come up with the battlev (repair), nothing much seems to occur.  No one selected &quot;Attack&quot; as the odds were that bad.

The actual &quot;Challenges&quot; work Ok, and trying to get the right combination crew can be quite a challenge.  Then you add a die roll to all this...  The randomness level is fairly high for a Knizia.

The clix is a neat idea, but it is not well suited for this kind of game, IMHO.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The energy management system (ie. cliks) works well and keeps the game simple.  The models are nice and detailed.

The cards are very thin, which is Ok as you can sleeve them, but the System location hexes are the same thinkness, which is very sad, as they skimed on the wrong components.

Gameplay is OK, although the Klingons have to be agressive.  You may want to move, then adjust your energy level if need be.  Scanning is nice, if it&#039;s an objective.

Only played one game, with 4 players, and it was a little long, but this is due to inexperience.  Will definitely be trying this one again.

Edit: Tried a 3-player game with the Romulan expansion, and we all liked it.

There is one nonsensical rule about winning the game, which disadvantages the first player.  If he scores 10 points, then all the other players need to do is match his score to steal the win.  You got to be kidding!?  Needless to say, we have stricken out this rule.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Played with 2, 3 and 6 players, and each time we did not complete the game (most players decided to stop playing).  There are some interesting mechanics (placing order tokens), the pieces are nice, except that those on stands appear prone to break (there were 3 broken units in the game I played - the game was brand new).  Further, the &quot;universe/planets&quot; is not thematic and gives an advantage to the attacker.  Game appears heavily geared towards combat, yet the combat system is not interesting and too long for what it is.Over all, I was disappointed, and did not object when 3 of the 6 players decided to stop playing.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting 2-player game, where one needs to explore sections of the galaxy (4 hidden decks of 10 cards), pick up and deliver goods (your choice, no &quot;orders&quot; cards) in order to generate a profit, which you can then use to upgrade your ship&#039;s stores, weapons, propulsion, etc.

There is little interaction between players, other then &quot;seeing&quot; the cards your opponent turns over, and the odd resource trade/theft now and again.

A good filler, if a tad long.</comment>				</item>

Except for a few typos (like the use of Tools) the rules are clear and concise.  Mechanics and gameplay is clean, yet there are multiple ways to victory.  Game scales well with 2-4 players, although I suspect it is best with 4 (played a 3-player game and it remained close!)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Easy to learn and quick to play.  A tad too random for me, but if you replaced the d6 by an average die (2-3-3-4-4-5), it would probably be more interesting, and less random!

As it is, a &quot;6&quot; is almost always a goal, while a &quot;1&quot; can put you in serious trouble, and both have little to do with where your &quot;players&quot; are located on the field.

Other then that, a great idea/concept, but it needs a little more polishing.</comment>				</item>

Too many players, too much down time between turns.  Theme is interesting, but some of the weapons (Stuffed Bear, Cat, Microscope) are just, well, boring.

It is a self-published game, so although the components look nice, the cardboard tokens are way too thin and difficult to pick up when playing on a smooth surface.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A fairly easy game, especially if you have solved SuDoku puzzles before.  Of course it is NOT exactly like the 9x9 grid, but rather centers around the placement of cards around other cards, the yellow cards being used as the center of a 3x3 section.

Players score points (a bad thing) when he/she cannot place a card on the table/grid.

[u]Strategy[/u]: Hold on to your yellow cards until you can no longer place any of your blues.  This may force the opponents to take penalty points because they can&#039;t place theirs, as yellow cards tend to open up the game.

[u]Card count[/u]: 9 yellow, 45 blue
Sadly, you don&#039;t have enough to use this deck to solve regular Sudoku puzzles.  That&#039;s too bad as it would have gotten extra points for that.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>An economic, political war game, where you will most likely see nuclear war.  The components are nice (mounted board, plastic playing pieces, paper money), and the game play is Ok, if you like this genre.

The economic system is a bit lame, the advantage going to the player who plays first (advanced and/or house rules may aleviate this).

Combat is relatively straight forward, and the political system is similar to Risk, in that it&#039;s via player interaction only.

Still a game I don&#039;t mind playing now and again, especially with the larger map and several of the expansions!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Perhaps we did not play this right, as my experience was not enjoyable at all.  The mechanics are simple, but there appears to be a combo available to the first player, and the last player seems rather disadvantaged.

In any event, I was able to place a few (4) cards, but was not able to pull them out without giving more points to my opponents.  Our 4-player game ended with a score of 87, -2, -6 and -20.  With only one player scoring positively....

The mechanic of having to move your pawns to town in order to collect gold tokens, then having to pay to move them back to the mine(s) is quite clean and works well.

On the other hand, the mechanic of adding cards to take control of town buildings and then trying to remove them or suffering negative points, does not work at all.

Rating should have been a 1, but I just love the Phalanx game components.  Still, you won&#039;t catch me dead playing this again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I picked up the French version yesterday (Feb.17/2007).  Here&#039;s a brief synopsis:

First off, gameplay is OK.  Appart from the neat &quot;Pathfinder&quot; idea, there is nothing new here.  FYI, &quot;Pathfinder&quot; is what they have called the color coding they have applied to each circle (space) which eliminates the need to check Line of Sight.

The 10 character pieces are pre-painted and the details are good.  The mounted board comes in four sections *which DO NOT inter-lock), and is double side, limiting you to two maps.  Expansions are alreay underway/planned.  The item and weapon tokens are nice and big, and each character board (with stats, etc.) are mounted.  That&#039;s right, mounted, just like the board is.

The combat system is very similar to that of Heroscape, with the addition of counter-attacking, at the cost of 1 victory point.

The glossy paper rulebook is in full color, but I find they go into too much detail on the basic stuff. 

The one thing this game is SCREAMING for is a player aid.  Actually, without a player aid it becomes a pain to play, as you need to refer to each character&#039;s &quot;kit&quot; in the rulebook in order to know the advantages each item and weapon provides.

My initial rating of 6 is after a single play in Deathmatch mode.  I don&#039;t foresee the other three modes/level of difficulty (Story, Catch The Flag, Domination) affecting my rating positively.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Game play is simple enough once you get around the terrible translation of what should be simple rules.

The tokens were difficult to remove from the sprue, which resulted in a few being damaged.

The game is a ripoff of an old favorite PC tile, X-COM:UFO DEFENCE, minus the cool tactical squad combat.

Playing time is closer to 2 hours, but with 10+ games, I&#039;m sure it can be done in 90 minutes.

All in all, it is a risk management game, with a lot of die rolling.  Replay value may appear low to some, as you are always doing the same thing, for 7 turns, which tougher aliens.

It is, unfortunately, rather pricey for what you get.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A mix of DUNGEON TWISTER and CHESS.  Each player has limited actions, which prevents the game from bogging down too much with more players.

For a first design, the quality of the components is impressive, right up to the felt underneath the waxed triangular boards!

Some luck is involved, in that a d8 is rolled in combat.  The addition of Cast Cards can tip the balance in your favor, so you need to plan when you will be using them, as some require you to have a unit on a specific colored tile (called Tria).

Each player has access to an ORB, which can be combined with one of his INKA (3D circular pawn), turning it into a powerful IDOL (Hero).  This Idol gains experience whenever his team wins a battle.  XP is taken as a +1 modifier to either combat or defense.  An Idol may not have more than 3 XP, so you need to decide if it will be used Offensively, Defensively, or a combination of both.

Eliminated pieces can be &quot;resurected&quot;, so a player is never out of the game, although his/her available actions are limited when he/she loses his leader (ELDER).

The game ends when only one ELDER (represented by a d4) remains, all the others having lost all four of their hit points.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>This is a card based game of Sid Meier&#039;s Civilization (certainly feels like it!).  If you enjoyed the PC version, there is no reason not to like this one!

The game flows well, but the full game takes about 6 hours to complete.

Seems to suffer from the runaway leader problem, as in a 3-player game our scores were close when around the 90 point mark, but the end was... well see for yourself:

238, 175 and 159

Still trying to understand what went wrong and why such a large point spread.  The person in the lead was ahead in every field, something which felt rather odd.  Perhaps she just had better card selections, as none of us lost a turn switching Gov&#039;t types, yet the spread between 1st and 2nd was 63 points (~30%), and with last it&#039;s 79 points (or ~50% of his points!?)</comment>	<conditiontext>2nd edition (with 315 wooden bits and the &quot;CE&quot; sticker)</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played my first 3-player game with the expansion using the recommended setup, and was rather disappointed...  Perhaps this was due to the fact that the monsters which came up first were too strong, as I was unable to go to the dungeon until I had a deck of 42 cards...  We start with 12, so that&#039;s 30 turns later.

Will be playing it again, but for now it&#039;s a disappointment.</comment>				</item>

The cards are too small, but the rest of the gaming material is good.  Nice drawings on the cards, wooden houses.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>An easy &quot;euro&quot; type game (no dice).  Players draw cards and attempt to build railroad segments between cities to score points.  These segments are built using color coded cards.  As an example, one needs to hand in a set of colored cards equal to the lenght and color of the track one wants to build/own between two cities.

Tickets are double edged, in that they provide you with extra points if you complete the route listed on the ticket, else you loose the points.

Once a player&#039;s markers (45) are reduced to less than 3, the last turn of the game is played, then the points are counted and compared to find a winner.

Player interaction is limited, although one may block another player by building a segment of track which he/she thinks the other player needs in order to complete a ticket.</comment>				</item>

Fairly straight forward, but can be long when played with analytical people.  Components are nice.  Not my type of game.</comment>				</item>

In the second round, you can only give 1 clue (then again you should know which cards are in the play deck).  Third round you cannot speak, but must act out what&#039;s on the card.  Can get hillarious.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>An excellent &quot;medium&quot; level game which is easy to learn, but still contains difficult choices and a few tactical subtleties.

The market fluctuation (semi-random) works well, and I especially like the water mechanism which increases the price to exploit the mine (similar to the sand in Thebes).  One has to spend time removing the water in order to reduce operating costs, so you are trying to maximize the cost to revenue ratio.

The &quot;time&quot; mechanic also appears to stem from Thebes, and it works quite well in this game.

Last but not least, one has to purchase VP using your cash, which is usually not plentiful.  This forces players to make tough choices are the earlier you spend money on the &quot;External Markets&quot;, the more VP they represent.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A mix of several worker placement mechanics, plus set building.  The &quot;bowl&quot; can be a brain burner, as it forces you to plan a few (3) turns ahead.

Possibility of action combos with Trajan and Building Tiles.  Will you be going for the bonus action, or pick up that Building tile which will hopefully allow you to have a set of 3 or 4 at the end of the game (and score a bonus 10 or 20 points)?

Some interesting decisions, and you can&#039;t really be blocked, although other players can pick up a title you were looking to get.

The &quot;people&#039;s demand&quot; is a nice clean mechanic which forces you to allocate a few actions in order to secure the needed tiles (forum or military) or Trajan permanent tiles (which are only worth 1 VP but will end up saving you time/actions).

The &quot;time clock&quot; allows for 2, 3 or 4 player configurations.

In the end, it&#039;s all about scoring points.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Wasn&#039;t convinced after the first play; second play confirmed this was a stinker.  2 points for the nice art and three language rulebook (French, German, English).

Game is way too long for what it is, an advanced worker placement game, in which you can become a spectator after the 1st turn (out of 6).

Re-read the rules (in both French and English) after first game to ensure we were playing this correctly.  Perhaps we just had unlucky event draws??  With no influence to modify/re-roll poor dice rolls, and not enough cash to make a decent die combo, was relegated to the status of spectator, trying to wrestle workers from other players who had Influence, Workers and cash to spare....  Uphill battle to attempt to stay on the positive side of the VP score...

Started off with 4 &quot;Workers&quot; in town, lost 3 (max you can lose in a turn) due to other player placements/actions, and managed to recoup one.

Started 2nd turn with 2 workers (dice), Influence wiped out by event, 7$, and attacking units tied up 1 out of 2 dice.  With my last die, was able to place one worker, and I lost 1 during the turn, thus down to two at start of 3rd turn.

Influence event still in force, wiped out my Influence, again.  &quot;Invading&quot; units wiped out my dice.  With one point of influence, little money, and no dice to generate income, I had to pass after trying to get another worker in town...  Half the game gone, 2 VP showing....  

Finished the game with 3 VP, about 25 points behind 3rd place.  Was never able to recoup the loss of 3 dice in the 1st turn.

Game winner, in both games, was the player with the most dice, from turn to turn.  Out of 4 players, 2 are in the race to win, the other 2 are unable to catch up and are mere spectators.

Will not be playing this one again.  For trade.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>A light party game where folks of all ages can play!

It is a dexterity game, which mixes in a bit of curling, as you can (try) to position your dice to block those in good scoring position, or &quot;take out&quot; those of your opponents.

A bit pricey for what is it, but it will keep the kids busy (even the adults).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Rating may be a little low, as I&#039;ve only played a single game as the US and was literally wiped out by the USSR player by turn #4, and he appeared to do so effortlessly...

It would seem that although we were both new (we were initially coached by a avid fan of the game), he grasped something I did not, which resulted in my demise.  The part I missed was how the cards get recycled back into the deck, and that one is better off not playing his events.  You see, the game is all about doing the right thing at the right time, and preventing your opponent from doing the same.  In order to have a good grasp of this game, one needs to be aware of all the cards, as well as their impact.  I&#039;m pretty sure my rating will go up after I&#039;ve played this a few more times.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A light game where event cards make pre-planning your moves next to impossible.  Fortune cards keep the game fresh as your opponents have no idea what your tribe can do to respond to an attack.  Need to be in the right mood to play this.

The game is centered on gathering food in order to survive and expand your tribe.

There is a lot of randomness, but it keeps the game interesting.

If your tribe can survive the first winter, then you&#039;re doing something right  ;-)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is a generic wargame in a WWII setting.  Scale is closer to Strategic than it is to Tactical.  Due to this it may appear to be bland to some players, but it is most excellent for those who like Strategic scale type games.

The block system is quite ingenious and offers very good fog-of-war, not to mention there is no need to record anything as it is all done using the blocks (and rotating them to record hits/damage).

Each unit is rated for Air, Land, Sea (combat) and Movement, which results in units having different specialties.  In turn, this provides the units with certain advantages and disadvantages.

Combat system is also interesting; it is an advanced version of what is seen in Axis &amp; Allies, with priority given to faster units, the defender always firing first when both players have the same type of units present.

Combat system rewards combined arms approach, and requires multiple waves to break through a well-defended area.  If your attack is not well planned and supported, it will most likely fail, especially if the dice Gods are not on your side.  Advantage goes to the low rollers  ;-)

Recommend getting the ELITE expansion, which adds more units.  The map expansions are also good to have.

Down side:
The game can bog down with multiple players as there is not much interaction except for the &quot;Air Response&quot; phase during which the defender can move air units (and Mech units with the ELITE expansion) to an area under attack.

Expect a lot of die rolling.

The entire game system can be rather costly.

Lastly, all units cost the same.  Making a house rule to alleviate this is relatively straightforward.</comment>				</item>

The wargame aspect is very minor, and the tower of death makes combat resolution instantaneous.  Unfortunately, I&#039;d prefer dice, as the tower can prove problematic if someone bangs the table (accidentally or not)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Obviously an Axis &amp; Allies variant, which includes some improvements and unfortunately, some major flaws as well.  Then again, perhaps we did not play this correctly, but as is the Axis simply have no chance whatsoever to win, unless they have lucky die rolls and their opponents do not.  Feels like A&amp;A with someone&#039;s house rules, where everything from A&amp;A is doubled, more or less...

Some of the positive points:
- Nicely detailed units (too bad they are all German)
- Nice board (a tad too big though)
- China has its own units!

Some of the negative points:
- After the first turn, Germany&#039;s attack versus Russia simply stalls.  The Japanese can wipe out the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, only to see the US spring up a larger fleet in a single turn.

With income levels over 100 (Germany starts at 127, USA at 147) it becomes an accounting nightmare (there is no chart, so accounting is done using pen and paper or poker chips in our case).

- The board is too large (6&#039; wide would have sufficed)
- No variety in unit molds (they are all German - Infantry, tanks, planes, ships, etc.)
- One has to cut each unit off the sprues (time consuming and teadious)
- Some units were damaged in transit (broken off gun on tanks, infantry, etc.)
- Some units are not well formed and/or are too brittle (88&#039;s with missing/broken &quot;leg&quot;)
- Some units don&#039;t &quot;sit&quot; well (subs usually lie on their side, CV bottom is not flat, fighters are too big to sit on the CV, BB is a tad small, Transport and DD difficult to distinguish from afar - the board is over 6&#039; long!)
- Unit color choices are bad for color blind gamers (USSR and China, even USA and Germany gave non-color blind players some issues?)
- Cardboard components, other then the map, are too thin, and warp badly.
- The rule which allows one to spring up Infantry anywhere on the board simply makes little sense, and breaks the game even further!
- Too many sectors/zones
- Way too long to set up!
- Fairly easy for the Axis to take control of the Med.
- China is now pretty tough to crack.
- Only 5 d12 included with the game
- Rulebook in B&amp;W, color version available online (this is a $100 game...)
- Advanced rules available for an additional $25...

Although I wanted to like this game, I find A&amp;A better, faster and cleaner.</comment>				</item>

Expect a lot of record keeping and counting.

The research tree is a nice addition, which adds to the record keeping and time.

The battle resolution system is very simple.

For a more interesting game, I suggest using the battle system from the ACW game.  It does add 5-10 minutes per battle, but is more realistic IMO.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played a 2-player game (Elves vs. Orcs) and found it interesting.  Game plays relatively fast and the resource reduction works well as it forces players to be agressive.  The &quot;experience&quot; cards add a touch of uncertainty as you are never certain if your army is stronger than your opponent until the battle starts and cards are played.  An interesting and playable concept.  Game pieces are generic but don&#039;t impact the enjoyment of the game.  As for lenght, our first game was under 2 hours, including setup and a few rules check.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A very nicely produced game!  Excellent quality components.

Simultaneous action selection is what attracted me to this one.  Period feel is also pretty good.  Only thing missing is fun.  It&#039;s an area majority game brimming with chaos.  Everything can be &quot;bought&quot; so the limiting factor is money...

Problem is the &quot;French Aid&quot;, which allows trailing players to get back in the game by providing them with money.  So, it rewards players for scoring low, by providing them with a large (up to $25) influx of money.  Money adds more flexibility/options, which in turn adds more chaos...

Unfortunately, French Aid is, IMHO, a game breaker.

If you keep your income mid-range for the first two turns, and your points low, you&#039;ll have an excellent chance at the win.  On the turn you receive the $20-25 cash influx, attack your opponents income base to essentially take them out of the game.

Imagine you are the leader, having concentrated on an economic strategy, and you are generating $23 a turn.  The player in last place has an income of $15, but a VP spread of 25 with first place...  He gets two good card picks (1st and 5th cards out of 8), AND an additional $25, bringing his income to $40 on that turn.  He then proceeds to attack your economic base.  Next turn you are generating 11, and he&#039;s at $40 again.  You are now relegated to the status of spectator, until your point spread allows you to benefit from French Aid...

So you want to keep your points low, in a game where it is rather difficult to predict just how many points you will be able to (not) generate.  This simply does not work for me.

Don&#039;t get me wrong, I am a wargamer at heart, and I like a good dose of chaos (dice, cards, etc.) but in WotR, it&#039;s over the top.


Ok, it&#039;s easy to complain and bicker, so how could we fix this?

How about adding TWO cards to the card row at the start of the turn, and allowing the player who&#039;s requesting French Aid to get the first two picks instead?  This would reduce the chaos produced by a sudden influx of $25, in a game already brimming with chaos.

If more than one player requests French Aid, then allow them to alternate picking their TWO bonus cards.

In the above proposal, the option to request French Aid should only be open to players with a point spread of 10+ with the leader.

My two cents.

The game can be enjoyable with the &quot;right&quot; type of players, and a smaller ranther than larger group, else the debates become endless.  Game Master must be strick on time and force a &quot;vote&quot; after the time is up.

This is the same as [GAMEID=925].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is the third game in the WINGS OF WAR series.  This one includes advanced rules, which include AAA, MG fire, Trench fire, strafing, bombing, recon and balloon busting missions, to name only those.  You will also find interesting rules on altitude and clouds!  I still prefer the simplicity of the altitude rules and flight constraints in CANVAS EAGLES.

If you&#039;d like to see what the WoW series is like, this is the game to get.

This one can be played by 1-2 players, thus solo play is possible.

And yes, it meshes very well with the other two games in the series.  Now all we need is a bigger box to store all the  pieces!

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>A fast playing air combat game.  Each turn players pick three maneuvers they will be performing, and players reveal each maneuver simultaneously, then resolve any combat before playing the next one.

There are only 4 decks of maneuver cards, which means that one cannot fly two planes of the same type unless one picks up another copy of the game or the maneuvers are written.

After five plays, then cards got sticky.  Using card protectors of some sort would not be all that great as it would make moving more troublesome.

I concur with Jody about the punch being off centered.

One thing which prevents this game from hitting my gaming table more often is the problem with ensuring the cards don&#039;t move and/or stick to your hand.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>This is a good trivia game, even if you&#039;re not a fan of such games.  All the answers will be numeral, and you don&#039;t need to know all the answers as questions are answered by all players simultaneously, on a white card (using a dry erase marker).

The player answers are then laid out on the &quot;Wagers&quot; board (excellent quality BTW!), in incremental order, which will provide the various answers with anything from 1:1 odds all the way up to 4:1 odds.  Players may then wager on the answer they think is the best one, without having gone over.

After seven rounds, the game ends, the player with the most money wins.

The game may appear to be a tad short, but you can adjust this if you&#039;d like.  A good &quot;party&quot; filler game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m not an adventure gamer, but did not mind this game at all.  It is a tad long, but being a wargamer, 4  hours is standard.  Although there can be some downtime when one player is engaged in combat, I find there is always something to do, so it&#039;s not boring down time.  The components are excellent, and the mechanics work well.  The game oozes with theme.

The combat system may appear bizarre at first, but after you&#039;ve played through one, it becomes intuitive.

The PvP aspect is something I do not particularly care for, as I feel it does not add to the game, but was added so it mimics the on-line game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Only played twice, at easy, and really like it.  Not a fan of App Assisted games, especially time constrained ones.

Nice component but should have included 2 more blue dice.

Not a fan of push-your-luck mechanic, but it works really well here!

The game is built around the theme, but its really a Euro Worker placement and resource management game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The concept of fighting an air combat using cards to counter each others actions is quite interesting, not to mention the Leader-Wingman rules work rather well.

A scenario/battle can be played in under 30 minutes, while a campaign will easily fit in one afternoon.  Anti-Aircraft and bombing/torpedoing rules also work well.  The designers did an awesome job of fitting everything on the cards, which are used to resolve everything!

The &quot;Corsairs and Hellcats&quot; expansion is more expensive then this game, which makes no sense.

BTW, Zero is missing 4 &quot;Full Throttle&quot; cards, which are included in the expansion (or you can order them directly from GMT).</comment>				</item>

The Creepers adds an extra level of complexity to a simplistic game.</comment>				</item>
