	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The game marries beautifully about Cluedo, BSG, Mr. Jack, and Arkham Horror. You need to find the Chosen One (Cluedo) which is some kind of savior, but one of you might be the one to kill him/her (BSG), to find them you must pick a character and use their ability and move them (Mr. Jack) in various location on map and gathering clues to help you (Arkham Horror).

The bonus mechanic is also unique, and limited actions in total one game (not one round) makes it very different with any other game. Also, while it&#039;s semi-coop with traitor, there&#039;s only one winner. There&#039;s no all hero side win together. But strangely the mechanic doesn&#039;t make one player (that&#039;s not the traitor) try to sabotage the main goal. This is truly quite unique game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>18XX is a series of train game about economic, and it has span out to it&#039;s own genre, separating from other games. While not the first game in line, 1830 clearly the trigger for the great many variants of 18XX family, a point of explosion in the history of train games. 

The game puts you in the position of rail barons, the investor in train industry. There is stock market mechanism that really captures the fluctuating price of shares, and not by random. When the corporations operates, it will be run by the president (who has most of the shares), but will pay (or maybe not) the dividend, giving the investors in those corporations more money to buy other shares. At the end, as all economic games, who has the most wealth wins. 

- An economical game about trains
- Simulates really well about stock market and price changes
- Quite realistic track making that gives satisfactory feeling at the end of the game.
- Simulates progression of technologies by the trains availability and special rules, making a progressive gameplay.
- Has many lots of opportunities for making clever play, either by stock manipulating or running the corporations. 
- No luck, all are player driven situations. 

There is a beauty in thinking and player interaction. This game sums it well, and I mean really well. From managing into speculating stock, into the decisions of running the company, and at last the subtle negotiations. Beautifully elegant. 

-----Remake of Mayfair is due, need to comment on that too, so far only played in PC and PBEM--------</comment>				<wishlistcomment>New edition</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is one of the awesomely epic 18XX. There&#039;s a lot of different company to play here, lot of things to track, and lots of chrome. But not just chrome, the game could be maneuvered around it. 

- Dynamic Priority deal and player turn
- 7 different types of company (not just private and major)
- Couple bonuses on run
- Interesting train type (and rusting system)
- Not really brutal stock trashing, but still possible to do. 
- Stock left in poll decrease price.
- Must do highest revenue route.

This is clearly one of the heavier 18XX. Not for newbie 18XX indeed. There&#039;s too much decision path to be made, and lots of mistakes can be corrected if you do the right thing. But some of them are not obvious. 6-8 hours is clearly the correct time. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A sedate version of 18XX, slow paced, and focusing more on train and track building rather than stock market. It&#039;s a game where you really want to play the companies rather than stock manipulating. Probably the best 18XX from 1829 line. 

Specialties:
- No privates, but bidding for contract bond of making route of specific cities
- 8 companies, some major, some minor
- 2(3) different tracks that can be run by specific train
- A lot of small town
- 1D stock market
- Selling or buying shares NEVER adjust price.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Rumored to be the best 18XX in 1830 branch, well, maybe at the time of release, but certainly not right now. But it&#039;s still a nice game. There are a lot of companies, so each player will at least get one. But it&#039;s true, player bankruptcy is a real risk! So it&#039;s brutal. The interesting thing is the ability to take loan and forming Canadian Government Railway. It makes the game fresh and so many dynamics.

Specialities:
- 11 Companies
- 1 of the Companies is the Government
- Can take loans for the companies
- Not fully capitalized, companies get money from selling shares
- The requirement to float is different on each phase
- Can upgrade or downgrade town.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This game is brutal and full of bad choices. The most you can do is choose the least bad choice. Map is small, but the tiles are very restricting. 

- Privates don&#039;t have special abilities
- May ignore one blocked station
- 1.5D Share prices
- Running must be contiguous, and must touch the home base
- Cannot buy the last train of a company
- Different par value area
- Can hold more than 60%
- No limit at pool

This is a very brutal, competitive, unforgiving game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Another great introductory game for 18XX series. This is almost as great as 18AL or maybe the same. It has more texture than 18AL, but with consequences of taking longer than 18AL. 

It&#039;s probably also has fiercer nature than 18AL, but still more forgiving than 1830. And the rules is more closely to 1830 than 18AL.

Specialties:
- Lots of private companies, with effect, exchange to shares, and block hex.
- 7 companies, making it interesting for any number of players
- The most similar of 1830 rules
- Terrain heavy
- Contested track tiles</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>This is a great, if not perfect, introductory game for 18XX series. Not to mention there is a wonderful redesign by Koryo. There are couple additional rules compared with 1830, but mostly are minor. The great things about this game is everything is particularly balanced. You can start anywhere and stay competitive. So no newbie doomed for the entire game just because his first company was wrong. 

What make this game perfect is that this game is tame enough for newbie, but still create chance for nasty play in stock or train buying by veteran. That&#039;s why it has great reply value, because there are so many strategies to explore. When you are tired of this (highly unlikely), I believe you&#039;ve ready to move on to other 18XX titles.

Specialties: 
- Beautiful redesign
- Print and Play
- Balanced companies
- Forgiving tiles
- Mostly similar as the 1830
- Town doesn&#039;t count in running train
- 4D trains to double the income
- Early game can only buy one train per turn
- Short bottom on stock market. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A fresh different 18XX. It has 1D stock prices, so it&#039;s on 1829 branch. But it&#039;s quite gamey in running the corporation. And I like the minor companies too. The downsides is the downtime. 1 OR is too long, because of the minor companies. Also, there are too many bonuses, while good, need a player aid, or it&#039;s easily forgotten. The 5 shares and 10 shares seems interesting, but quite useless in execution. 

Specialties:
- 15 minor companies without privates
- Minor can merge into major, and assimilate
- Many run bonuses
- 1D stock market, and fixed 2 OR
- Not fully capitalized, only by selling shares
- Can convert from 5 shares to 10 shares. 
- 4D train is unlimited range, but can only get income from 4 cities, and doubled.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is probably one of my lowest rank of 18XX. The game has so much promises, yet fails in delivery. All the tension was when bidding Minor, but then the rest of the games feels flat and dry. The game protects you so much, unfortunately that means protecting your opponents too, making this uneventful game.

Specialities:
- 15 Minors that can (must) merge to make Major companies
- No different zones at stock market (2D)
- Players cannot sell the shares before it operates
- Tracks are very restricted
- May split dividend

I give it twice (for maybe the 1st time is just wrong setup or something), but it didn&#039;t improve on 2nd play, so won&#039;t likely play again. The game is not too bad, but compared to lot others 18XX, so many titles to play, and so little time to play, making me probably won&#039;t play this game again. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>36</numplays>			<comment>This is a great light game about drafting, with civilization theme. But unlike fairy tale (which only set collection game), there&#039;s a great amount of mechanics in this game. Also, each player will have their own wonder (with different ability) making the game really flavorful. 

The game itself is very tactical, with some degree of strategy. There&#039;s no winning strategy. You must be able to look at your opponents, and draft accordingly, whether try the strategy that they&#039;re not doing, or counter draft. Also, the game is quite easy to teach (if you&#039;re experienced teacher), and lots of fun, making it great game for gateway.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is the granddaddy of all Civilization games. Truly monster in game time alone. But the mechanics are a wonderful design. Truly breakthrough in new breed of gaming genre. Through the Ages may surpass it, but some of AdvCiv still has its own strength.

I&#039;ve only played the PC game, so haven&#039;t tried it with other player, which I&#039;m sure will be great!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I know it might seem harsh for fellow countryman, but unfortunately in and adventure game, I&#039;m hoping to do some adventuring, beefing up my character, and probably do final, climatic battle. And that&#039;s where this game lacks. The final battle is anti-climatic, and has no relation whatsoever about your character growth. Anybody (as long as they pass the requirements) can kill it, provided enough luck. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Conan has unusually strong mechanic and fun to play. The way to do battle and intrigue, the fate dice pool, every kingdom has their own cards, all is good. Sadly, all of this soiled by the presence of Conan (it should be good, but in this game, it breaks this game). The player who controls Conan gets a huge advantage, and if there are some Conan+Court dice at pool, most of the time it will be picked first. It makes Conan control is too big part of the game, and making the kingdoms more less just like furniture. Good at 1st play, but will be bored about it soon. </comment>				</item>

On the contrary, it&#039;s a great euro, but the theme of discovering new world is integrated well. On the other hand, the downside is too much focus on economy strategy. So, it&#039;s like no other strategy at all, whoever got to the best economy WILL win the game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>Truly heavy brain burning game. This is Railroad Tycoon on steroids. A great game about train and delivering goods. It needs heavy foreplanning, and very unforgiving game. You could be entered into death spiral if you are not careful. 

The great things about this game is how you plan your move and track building, into the last turn of delivering maximum length of route. The production part of the game really handled well by some luck, might affect your strategy if you are not prepared.</comment>				</item>

But the beauty of this game is the magnificent interaction of human to human and to mechanism. &quot;You need to do this and before that do that after that will do those&quot; kind of feeling is so strong here. And the theme is integrated so well, so you can&#039;t just suddenly re-theme Agricola. Not only that, the replayability is HIGH, because of the cards. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This game derives heavily from Chicago Express. But it removes some of things that I dislike about Chicago Express and add some things that I really like.

- The turn order is variable, depends on your previous action.
- Starting city of each company is variable, making more replayability options
- Putting the income only at city making it more sense than Chicago Express. No more raising income with spreading to mountain without reaching the cities.

Overall feel, the game is more calculating and evaluation. This is where experienced players will usually have better decision than the less experienced. It&#039;s sign of a good game. </comment>				</item>

It&#039;s very tactical, but while sometimes I don&#039;t mind tactical games, but the scoring nature is against tactical play, which I find counter-intuitive. I don&#039;t feel like I have any control in the game, so I hate it. </comment>				</item>

It&#039;s truly masterpiece in design, so many interwoven things that hard to separate mechanics and theme (except the conspiracy, weakest mechanic-theme link). All in all, the theme is so great and drenched, by the time you finish, you would be drunk by cyberpunk noir detective situation. The only downside is the downtime between player, without clear possibilities to formulate strategy in other players turn. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s hard to describe the awesomeness of the game until you play all of them. All of those hype, and this game actually exceeds it. It manages to capture most of the feeling playing RTS (particularly Starcraft) without actually making it real time game. 

Not only that, the asymmetry is delicious. All of the factions have a very distinct play style, and each of them can be played one way or another, depends on your strategy. And this game does reward skill and experience. There&#039;s lot of decision coming from your limited handsize, dual use nature of the cards, and to resource or not to resource. 

If I may nitpick is the only need of screens. It simulates fog of war quite good, and I have no other solutions, but it&#039;s not cheater-proof. I don&#039;t play with cheater, but the idea of the possibility is bugging me a little. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>In deck building games, this probably the less strategic of all. But also the best component and as fun as others. The idea to combine all card pool seems work. And it does make the game easier to setup and clean up. 

Oh, and the theme is also pouring out in this game. </comment>				</item>

You cannot play this fast, and with equal skill and deck, the game can stall very loooong time. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>This is a heavy duty game in my gaming group, mainly because for it&#039;s easy and fast gameplay. Unfortunately another reason was because we didn&#039;t have many games back then. We&#039;ve played it too often, that&#039;s why I got a little bit reluctant to play this again, but it still a good game.

After a while, this is probably still the best stand alone Carcassonne ever created</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is one of the games that good on paper, but eventually fail in execution. &quot;A worker placement game with heavy western theme and high interaction!&quot; really sound appealing. The theme starts strong on the setup, but turn to ambience during the game. And the interaction give hurt than good. Since the amount of die rolled here were small, a big unlucky (or lucky) roll can really change the game a lot. Doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s a bad thing, but it makes Carson city falls on party game rather than strategy games. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Pretty much combination of many mechanics. At first when I read the rules, it seemed blend pretty well. After playing it though, it&#039;s clunky. It&#039;s harder than any other game to see the immediate result of your action, thus forming strategy is more difficult.

Most of us after playing it didn&#039;t really know what could we do differently. I mean, we didn&#039;t really catch why we were lost, or worse, why we were winning. 

It&#039;s not a bad game, especially the board is absolutely gorgeous. The rule are simpler than Caylus, but the strategy is harder to form than Caylus. Very not intuitive game. </comment>				</item>

The mechanic is good, and the options of what you can do with your dice are more vast than Troyes. But, Troyes has better dice manipulation means, making it if you want a specific action, Troyes can do better than this. </comment>				</item>

The sheer number of strategy and move options will never run out even in many millenia. The language independence is one of the charm in the game. Everything has it&#039;s icon. Looking afar, it&#039;s one of the classic boardgame. One thing for sure, this is a nasty game. And the funny thing is, there are many good laugh from this game, even it&#039;s a brain melter game.

But after playing it, the theme was flowing like thick hot milk that I don&#039;t care anymore about the area control. This game is (super) awesome. The balance and the asymmetry are delicious. This game might simple at first, but there are so many subtle strategy and tactics inside, and the interactions is high. Other player actions will CLEARLY affect you. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Elegant.

I rarely using that word, but that&#039;s what I describe for Clash of Cultures. It&#039;s the most accessible Civ game right now (the real Civ game, not lite-Civ like 7 Wonders or Roll Through the Ages). All the mechanics works beautifully one another, and very thematic. There are couple of things that kinda miss for me, making me cannot rate it 10 like others. But, coming from the genre that I love most, this is still a great game!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Will look for it until it has good publisher</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This game is quite brain burning. And relies a lot on player interaction. You cannot play by yourself, since the only way to get goods to your harbor, you must buy form another player&#039;s factory. To have goods on your island, you must buy from another player&#039;s harber. It&#039;s a layer of layer of layer of production and purchasing.

Unfortunately, the scoring is based on set collection. But the beauty of the components, combined with the interesting logistics, makes up for it. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s the best combination of RFTG and Dominion. You have cards that stay permanent in your area, but also doing some deckbuilding. Since the turns is limited, you won&#039;t shuffle a lot like Dominion, and your cards feels more meaningful. Also, with the sector system, the cards are progressively better, you&#039;re hardly screwed like in RFTG getting high cost card earlier, and cannot have your main purpose card later. 

And the theme is quite apparent. Interaction is mediocre, but there&#039;s some tense on some occasion. It feels like Mage Knight by preparing your deck and army, to get better things. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is truly a game of negotiation. If you just want to play a game about diplomacy, this is the game. Simple enough to easily teach, and gametime is quite short so you don&#039;t feel dragged. 

The elements for negotiation are a LOT of variable player powers, with the cards and some different effects, making it very high on dynamic and replayability. But it really needs correct group of player, or the game will be boring. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This game, is what Age of Empire  should have been. As always, area majority is not one of my favorite mechanic, but that&#039;s only one of the mechanic. The other is worker placement which I love, and so many other little things. There are so many clever ways to play, so many little things to track by your brain. Experience will clearly helps you to guess/prevent/piggyback your opponent moves. Beautiful mechanism.

Unfortunately while the theme feels wonderful at first game, it becomes less recognized and more about mechanic. Since it&#039;s area majority, so mostly it&#039;s about move/remove pieces, and such. Opponents play WILL affect you, good or bad. Having said that, this game is really brain burning (a big plus for me!) and take quite long (doesn&#039;t matter for me). So while it&#039;s a good game, it&#039;s not for newbie for sure. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>When I read the rulebook and saw the components, I was afraid that the game was too simple, dry, deterministic, chess-like. I&#039;m happy to find out that was wrong. Although the battle was deterministic, the game was full of theme. The hero, the monsters, all have their own twist and flavor. What a beautiful gameplay.

The only downside is the system is 1 vs many. System that I care less than even from co-op</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Probably this is THE negotiation game I&#039;m looking for. The premise of negotiation game is you need to have possibility to need help or helping other players, and so mechanically your move should be affected a lot by other player actions. It&#039;s pretty easy to fall on each end (Full diplomacy like Cosmic Encounter or, well, Diplomacy, or maybe full mechanical like Chicago Express or Container). But Dune strikes the perfect balance of mechanic and diplomacy. 

Not to mention the special abilities of each faction is clearly bringing out the Dune theme a lot. Theme is dripping! The only downside is it&#039;s truly at its best at 6 player. Less is probably playable, but I don&#039;t know. </comment>				</item>

But that&#039;s for the base game. The expansion really helps out for the epicness</comment>				</item>

As the game has no luck at all (aside from the random of board, which is impartial), it&#039;s usually compared to chess. True, I had a feeling playing chess when play this, but unlike Navia Dratp, the themes overflow hugely. Very brain burning indeed</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I was worried that having read so many reviews, this game will fall flat to me. Too generic tile, too generic enemies. But too my surprise, it holds quite few enough flavor to be tasty. Not super delicious, but tasty enough.

I don&#039;t know if it holds repeated play, but there&#039;s quite couple strategy to play here. Blindly forwarding will surely generate game over. So nice simple game, but not worthy for the price I think.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Finally, the miniature tactical gaming that are near perfect. I really loves deep complex game, and this game really offers a lot of aspects that you could do as persons in the game. But the greatest part is you can teach elements of the game modularly and step by step. So it&#039;s great for casual gamer, but also can deliver great game for hardcore gamer.

Usually I hate scenarios. Since in the game with scenario, I don&#039;t know which scenario should I use to &quot;compare&quot; my skills with opponents that are widely accepted as common full blown all aspects of the game. Well, in here, each scenario just a teaching tools, in which also its own good game, but the real deal is SAGS

Scenario Auto Generating System. How cool is that? You can build random map. Not only that, you can play up to 4 players too!! This will create infinite possibilities and replayability. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>29</numplays>			<comment>Eclipse should be perfect in almost all aspect of 4x/Civ game. It has the exploration, tech researching, engine building, combat, and many things. Just tiny minor nitpick, it&#039;s [b]almost[/b] perfect. 

Most of the game weigh heavily on combat. Half of the tech is around military, and basically instead military is one of the tools to win, in here military is THE tools to win. Doesn&#039;t mean this is a bad game, just not really what I expected in 4x/Civ game. The tech is not that interesting either, since most of it just better stats, not additional abilities.

But in the end, I can&#039;t deny that it&#039;s almost perfect game. So I&#039;d love to play it always. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>To compare this with Core Worlds is not really correct. They only share same theme and same year of release. But Eminent Domain relates more with RFTG (and somewhat Glory to Rome). Unfortunately the combos are quite simple, so it&#039;s not as deep as RFTG, which occupy more or less same gametime. So it&#039;s not really worthed. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Well, it&#039;s a Scotland Yard in upgrade. The game drenched in theme from Bram Stoker&#039;s Dracula, but only the environment, not the story. All characters, and everything here is very Draculaic and great. But when you play, the story doesn&#039;t really narrate much. It&#039;s still interesting in it&#039;s own right. The Dracula loves when the hunters are confused, and the Hunters love when the Dracula&#039;s cornered. It&#039;s a balanced I guess.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Overall it&#039;s a good game, and integration to the story is quite good. But the main gripe for me (and quite fatal) is the event card. Especially Mustering. I think I wouldn&#039;t have a problem if the events just some kind of outside force affecting your government. But not to be able to recruit people (even when you are rich) and need to wait the stupid event is just downright ridiculous. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This game is surprisingly good. After my disappointment in AGoT the boardgame, this is a very joyful experience. So we still CAN play a decent game of thrones after all. 

The gameplay is rich with strategy, tactics and theme. Luck is quite a minimum factor here (unlike the boardgame). Not to mention the customizable deck, but without the agony blind buy of TCG.  </comment>				</item>

With tile placement mechanic and somewhat variant of thebes&#039;s turn order mechanic, the game really shines with all its cohesiveness. The interactions is simply elegant. In addition of tile snatching, the game has built in interaction of scoring mechanic, in which we score the differences of with player who has the least in each category. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The simulation during reformation period is really hit it all. Mechanically and thematically, it&#039;s perfect. And by the main mechanic to be CDG, it really brings out the dilemma of playing cards for conventional means or events. The asymmetry of each factions really brings out the theme. There are a lot of rules that covered almost all of things that happened during that time. 

The downside is it&#039;s not really scaleable number of players, since all the factions need to be played. And I don&#039;t really dig historical theme, unless it&#039;s spanning across ages like Civilization. </comment>				</item>

And there are 3 kind of influence, and every ideology has their own power and weakness. Everything blended into a game of conflict with a lot of theme. </comment>				</item>

Balance between searching for gathering resources (and population), making buildings, and also trying to attack other people, combine that with different deck for each player (and many abilities), making it one of the best resources game I&#039;ve ever played.</comment>				</item>

Well, to tell the truth, it&#039;s not about the country. But the game mechanism is really good. As economic as 18XX games, but with very different mechanisms. A lot of planning, tactical and strategy, a little bit diplomacy and nastiness to other player, make this game very delicious. </comment>				</item>

There are ways to get resources (plans and parts) and spend them (upgrades or assembles) but also means to be more efficient on those areas (training track). and also small short term goal that will be scored. And while the theme is about car making, it has a very good ties with the mechanics. </comment>				</item>

And typical of Martin Wallace games, it&#039;s not abstract. There&#039;s quite a theme interwoven to the mechanics there, and it gives opportunity for clever play. I like it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>I always want fantasy adventure boardgame. But aside from Magic Realm, no game ever reach the &quot;goodness&quot; that I want. They&#039;re either too much luck or too simple. Of course there are some good fantasy dungeon game (like descent, claustrophobia), but what I want is more on adventure side. And then came Mage Knight.

- Randomized Map
- Variable player power
- Cunning play over luck (luck can be minimized a lot)
- Units to command
- Various skills, advances, and spell
- Flavorful enemies, locations, and adventures.
- So many scenarios to adjust playability

They answer almost everything I need. And the expansions make it better. This is a very heavy game. Not for boardgame newbie. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>27</numplays>			<comment>This game is truly magnificent. Top of my list. Complex, but it has everything you could ever dream in Fantasy adventure boardgame. A holy grail, that no boardgame could ever replace since 1979! 

Beware of the intimidating rules. Learning this by your own is a pain. It&#039;s easier if someone teach you, but learning by yourself is long hard road ahead.

And it&#039;s totally worth the pain, believe me. Legendary Treasure inside! A list you could do here:

- Different Character to play (with VERY different playstyle)
- 1 to 16 players without ANY rule changes whatsoever. No change to setup, no special rules.
- Players can join and quit the game anytime, without breaking the game. 
- Can play cooperative, competitive, or semi and backstab, without any additional rules. The game really made to encompass all of it in balance
- Superb mechanics about damage and vulnerability (and weight)
- Non HP character, and you get weaker when wounded (or fatiqued). 
- Controlled Luck
- Great mechanics of combat which really simulates dungeon crawl combat.
- Wide array of treasures and magic. And the differences is NEVER by stat number. Every treasures and magic has DIFFERENT effect.
- Randomized setup for limitless replayability
- Great mechanic on encounter/monsters. Still random, but you know what to expect. 
- Many victory conditions, combined with variable character, make the gameplay rich.
- Horse to use as mule or stead.
- Interactive NPC (can trade, fight, or even HIRE)
- Everything is possible! Improbable maybe, but never impossible. 
- Unique way to cast magic and handle the cost.
- Can incite war to different faction of NPCs
- Optional rules for weather and level up.

So really, is there any element on fantasy adventure that is NOT in Magic Realm?</comment>				</item>

Until this time, it&#039;s still the best game to introduce to non-gamer people. Granted, for gamer person, this game is kinda dull and repetitive. But it&#039;s fun, and to this point, never fail bringing inner gamer from all non-gamer I know. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The game almost feels like 18XX game. There&#039;s a share price, and the price can go up or down depends on your actions. Also there&#039;s a different price for the product, so not only the share price. The only thing that makes this a lesser game is the luck (though not much, but 18XX has NO luck). But, the game makes a great use of blind bidding, simultaneous actions, stock market, and set collection (the only thing I&#039;m not fond of). </comment>				</item>

From having manage your own ship, finding rumor, trading, and pirating, the theme really evokes well. Unfortunately the gameplay hinders me. See, I like controlled luck, that is, you can modify your rolls or something. There&#039;s some degree modification in this game, but not enough to say &quot;controlled&quot;. A pity, since other than that, I love the other aspect of the game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Nightfall gives a little twist about deckbuilding. It&#039;s certainly the most different from all other deckbuilding. The way to play cards (chaining), buying (claiming) and the cleanup (not discard all of your hands) to the final score (having the LEAST of &quot;VP thing&quot;).

One problem is, the way to give someone wounds (-1VP) is to attack them. It&#039;s nice to be interactive, but with this system is VERY prone to kingmaking. No matter how good your deck is, as long as you&#039;re targeted, then you&#039;re history. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Wow, that&#039;s all I can say after playing this. It&#039;s a resource management galore, on steroids. It reminds me of The Settlers (PC game, not Catan), and I really love that game where you can process goods from grain to flour to bread to food for worker to build other buildings, and other resources that have their own path. There&#039;s almost nothing that I dislike about this game (the player boards is okay, not bad)

The only gripe is the name, or to some extent, the theme. I don&#039;t see why it needs to be about clergymen, since you could retheme it into normal medieval village trying to grow and I would dig it better. During my first time playing I keep wondering where is the &quot;religion&quot; theme in this game, and at the end it&#039;s none. </comment>				</item>

But the gameplay is as different as north and south. And it does capture the need to smartly organize your stock. Unfortunately, it&#039;s too simple for my taste.</comment>				</item>

The amount of details in events and civilization advances I think already make this game eligible for a full civilization game, not just civ lite. Perhaps the time needed, the pocket-sized game, and solo play, make this civ-lite, but the contents are definitely not!</comment>				</item>

If you want realism, need to try wargame, but like me, hates modern or historical battle, then this is the game for you. The only problem for the game is the slow pace.</comment>				</item>

The mechanic interaction is so dynamic, make many interesting replayabilities. But the learning curve is pretty steep. After you pass it and everything clicks, you will see a whole new world!!!!

Unfortunately, the expansion is stretched out a little bit too much. Making the game too random for what it&#039;s worth.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>All in all, it&#039;s a great 18XX for 2 player game. It lacks of route building of course, but compacted more into company (holding in this game) port folio (like any 1825 branch) and train (railroad in this game) management. And like any other 18XX, there&#039;s a great deal of learning curve to understand the strategy.

- 1D stock market
- No route, just fixed revenue
- Interesting bidding of privates (Investor in this game)
- Unusual shares certificate
- Many optional train. </comment>				</item>

Oh well, the game plays very much like Railroad Tycoon with different map and cards. And also some bonuses. I like the map better than the original. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A brilliant game! Really captures and simulates nearly everything from the birth of Rome until its decline. The rulebook makes it harder to learn than it is. It&#039;s really a great game with natural flow if you know all the rules. 

The best part of this game is the negotiation. This game takes best part of gamey and negotiation, making it seems like Cosmic Encounter with many other things to do. As always, gametime might be a long, but what can you say for epic and perfect game. Unfortunately the theme is Classical Rome. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>At first I thought it resembles Thunderstone, but after playing it, I think it&#039;s more familiar to Dominion. The card effect bearing little to the theme, so it&#039;s kinda dry. After couple of plays it&#039;s just about the mechanic. 

It&#039;s quite a good game actually. You could still play it with strategy (remember, more Dominion like), and the VP card won&#039;t clutter your deck (more leeway deckbuilding, and easier to score). But it has push your luck element too. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Comparison with Dune is inevitable. But for me, Rex has better rules, better clarification, and better gameplay experience overall. It&#039;s shrewd negotiation and cunning play packed into one solid game. The only thing that I miss is the ability to bribe other players anytime. 

I could see why Dune veterans will still love Dune better. If you have played Dune 20+ times, and will continue to do so with frequency about 10 times each year, I believe you will like Dune better. But for limited experience with Dune, and won&#039;t play that many, Rex is better. </comment>				</item>

Unfortunately the goal is pretty much the same. The difficulty lies on to calculate the turn, and where should you stop, gold, coin, go for stock exchange. If only there is another way to win, it would be better. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I like ROTK theme. It&#039;s a heroic story with politics and development. This game almost nailed it. But miss with very fatal flaw. There is no development or resources. Just land grabbing with your generals and that&#039;s it.

And the biggest flaw is combat. Essentially it&#039;s just rock-paper-scissors. If you lose, you die. Even it&#039;s Lu Bu against some peasant. If tie, only then you will compare the combat power. So silly. No soldier number. Just rock-paper-scissors.

The artworks are quite nice artistic though. </comment>				</item>

Downtime is too much, and no spells. NO SPELLS. What kind of fantasy is that? And it&#039;s too repetitive. Kill, upgrade, kill. But it does capture a little bit about fantasy adventure, so I&#039;m intrigued to play if the mood strikes it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Another great game with scale almost like TI3. It has resource management, Army, role/action selection. Many jockeying on mechanic but still having great portion of theme. As like TI3, the base game has some flaws, but maybe it will be eliminated by expansions.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>This game is wonderful economic game, with Fantasy theme! What more could I ask? Apparently, game-time. It will take some time (maybe 2-3 hours), because so many calculations to be made (like power grid). But that doesn&#039;t mean repetitive, far from it. Instead every turn you will progress to be better. And the tension battle of auctions really makes it strategical yet also tactical. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>For Co-op game, this is not bad. But for a game itself, it suffers from wild swings of luck. From the mechanic on the rulebook it seems there&#039;s a lot of room for clever plays. Unfortunately during the game, it actually doesn&#039;t matter that much. Yes, you can do stupid things, that&#039;s definitely path to failure. But you can do average thing and still win, or you can do your best thinking and still lose. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I must admit, I was drawn by pretty bits and rich theme. But, it&#039;s not as fun as Arkham Horror. Although it&#039;s kinda fun a game world in Arthurian legend, I couldn&#039;t help feel a little bit empty when playing it. Unlike Arkham where you need to do couple of things to close the gate or something, in here, to progress basically you just discard a card. It&#039;s the adventure feeling that lack, not to mention the release of Battlestar Galactica, which is better in EVERY regards. </comment>				</item>

It has some area control, majority, and first of all, programmed action. The game is quite nice with some limited situations (you can&#039;t war with all), so it takes some cunning to play. But, the danger of kingmaking lurking greatly here. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>52</numplays>			<comment>This is a wonderful game about civilization. The quality of components is beautiful like usual FFG standard, with some of the arts come from Civ V the PC game. It really captures the gameplay of Sid Meier Civilization (in PC), with some of it are streamlined for boardgame. There are:

- City outskirts (and resources around it)
- Buildings
- Modular map
- Tech Pyramid (brilliant idea!!)
- Wonders
- Great People
- Asymmetry player (civ) power
- Multiple winning conditions
- Some luck, but easily mitigated with good play

All of the 4x (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) are presented here. Although it bears the same theme with Through the Ages, surprisingly it&#039;s very different. SM Civ focuses on parts where Through the Ages only touch it lightly. It&#039;s clearly a great game. 

Also, this is rare for FFG, but the base game is completely balanced! There is really no need for expansions, except for more culture cards and civilization choices (Errata and FAQ&#039;s still needed though). But that&#039;s minor. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>At first I thought this game would be awful, based on everybody reviews about this game. After playing it, it exceeded my expectation. Though mechanic-wise it&#039;s inferior than Through the Ages, it&#039;s still well designed (but not well tested). I had an epic feeling when playing it, and sure it was fun. The downside is it was really long. 

The component and artwork needed some mention too. The quality of miniature are pretty good. And the artwork is genius. Many puzzles and stories behind every work of the artist.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s not a bad tactical game per se, but not great either. The game got nicely wide array of units, but unfortunately the difference is not that great (only power and movement). Not really textured. The special ability doesn&#039;t do any much game effect. Seems like wasted potential. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Space Bastards has quite interesting mechanism. Simultaneous action selection mechanism, combined with variable relationship between aliens, so during a game one kind of alien could be very powerful but weak during other games. Unfortunately it&#039;s quite chaotic, and prone to AP. I&#039;m fine with one of them but dislike both in the same game. Because it&#039;s chaotic you cannot plan that much further, resulting you have nothing to do during your opponents turn. </comment>				</item>

It&#039;s fast paced, tense, and gory! I love it when the game is this brutal, but not chaotic. Luck certainly play part in this, but not dominating. A sign for a good game.

The basic gameplay is very simple rules of movement and shooting, but high tactical and spatial skills are needed to win the game. Not only that, you can customize your ship (pilots and upgrades) and also your army composition. Definitely a blast to play</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>A great sci-fi game. I love StarCraft in PC, but please don&#039;t really compare it to the boardgame version. It has different feeling and mechanism, it&#039;s a brave move from FFG and I think it&#039;s a good move. Rather than try to be exact like the PC game as possible, they made a good playable space wargame. There is development and research, battle of armies, and area controlling. And the components are pretty.

When you get familiar with the faction&#039;s ability and mechanics, this become quite cool subgame of cunning play. The only downside is all of them are geared towards military (It&#039;s Starcraft after all). </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>2 Player Game.

At first when I read the rules, it seems bland and dry. Sure it simulates a complex game of siege, but it seems so generic. After reading new rules with little thematic background, it improves a little. But when I played it, it feels so good. When we are familiar with all of the actions there, the game will play fast, and it is a good game for 2 player. 

I consider this a lot with War of the Ring. After some thinking, I think war of the ring suffers from long setup, although it&#039;s comparable with the epicness. But for 2 player game, I think this is better compactness. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>86</numplays>			<comment>Civilization is a genre created by game called Civilization. But to this date it&#039;s still unclear whether the boardgame or the PC game (by Sid Meier) is the trigger of the genre. It doesn&#039;t really matter anyway, since the elements inside are things that make this genre great.

- Span of ages in time, from primitive to modern.
- Different technologies to research, giving many abilities
- Different civilizations, giving each player different powers
- Explore the world and use it resources
- Managing population, happiness, and other resources to successful civilizations
- Complex gameplay

Those all the great aspects of Civilization game. And to some extend, Through the Ages nearly captures it all. Sid Meier should be proud, since it&#039;s inspired by the PC game more than the boardgame. Great game, great mechanics, all together in one. The randomized setup and how things are available game make it very high replayability. Luck has some part here, but ultimately the decision is the one that make or break the victory. A perfect situation for controlled luck. Combined with there are so many path to victory, I can say this game is perfect.

But because of that, there is now a Thunderstone, with rich thematic feeling and great gameplay.

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>I was drawn to this game since the first play. It doesn&#039;t really simulate postal service, but you can relate it to some extent. What I like about this game is scattered VP all over the board, giving the player some sense of purpose. And while it&#039;s card driven, if you play it smartly, you could minimize the luck. At first I thought it&#039;s multiplayer solitaire game, since it&#039;s about racing. But the more experience you play, the more you could jerk the player after you. Wonderful.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Troyes is a game about worker placement and dice management. The game relies heavily on controlled luck, which I really love. Even though there are a lot of dice rolled, the better player usually won. This is because so many things can affect the dice, and the scoring method is partially hidden. It has everything I love except one...

The theme is just a dry medieval world. But it&#039;s a good game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>This is a great game about sci-fi civilization. You get war, technology, colonizing, politics, everything you could think of. The gameplay also combination of Euro and AT, making it awesome. It&#039;s the best 4X (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) boardgame to date. Simulates most of everything, there are no other words beside: EPIC! This what you get inside:

- (Lots of) Variable player power
- Many technologies to research, giving special abilities
- Although the ship models are same, but different technologies and race power can give a very different characteristics of gameplay
- Colonizing planet is one of the key to victory, but not always. Enough is the word.
- Diplomacy and negotiation CAN affect your victory.
- Role selection mechanics for determining phase of the game, but not strictly govern it.
- Neat mechanism about action points and movement in this game. 

The base game itself would rate about 2-3 (yes, really!) since it&#039;s so broken for 3+ hours game. But the expansions making it perfect. NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE! Even in your 1st play. 

I repeat:
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a nice twist for worker placement mechanism. As usual, worker placement are used to fill slot of available actions, but additional from that, you also need to determine the timing when the said actions will be resolved. 

The thing is, it&#039;s somehow chaotic during the nature of randomization. You could have strategies, but you need to cross your finger for that. A nice break from heavy analytical games. But not too brain burning. </comment>				</item>

It is the best game to date that could create the moment in Lord of the Rings world. Almost everything has their own mechanism. An Epic game, and it&#039;s great especially with 2 players. Very high replayability with tons of strategies on each game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Usually I don&#039;t record playing with expansions. But since BoTA brings its own game, I&#039;ll rate it by that. The combat is a little bit more complex, and many other mechanics shifted a little, but basically it plays like WotR. Unfortunately, with almost same amount of time, and less epic story (only one episode, two towers or return of the king). 

So while it is a good game, I&#039;ll prefer the original game (even without expansion) anytime. BUT, with BoTA, the original game really improves a LOT! The rating here The rating here should be 10 with the base game.</comment>				</item>

It does have quite a new fresh mechanic, but blended in with the theme. The artowrk is awesome, and the deck building seems quite fun. Will need a lot of play to see if it&#039;s balanced. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The game is about economic and industry. It&#039;s easy to understand the rules, but it&#039;s not really easy to understand the game. It has very unintuitive game flow. Contrary to other games, it has a lot of options at the beginning but very little options at the end. Confusing. But it&#039;s still nice brain burning game. </comment>				</item>
