	<numplays>42</numplays>			<comment>Okay, there&#039;s a learning curve here.  For an experienced gamer, though, it&#039;s only about one game.  After the first game I knew everything I had to know and started to work on trying different strategies.  It was around that second play that I really fell in love with it.  Gorgeous game that plays really, really well.  I can&#039;t believe such an involved game can play seven people in 30 minutes, but it can.  This is one of the best games of the year, no doubt.  *Update* - 13 plays later and it&#039;s made my 10 list.  Absolutely love it.</comment>				</item>

I knew the kids would enjoy it, but I&#039;m finding it working with both kids and adults, all through the gamet of player numbers.  It&#039;s just fun, and great to roll dice too.  The decisions presented are enough to keep interested as well.  Fun!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Abyss is indeed a gorgeous game.  I would not say the MOST gorgeous I have played, but it is very, very well put-together.  Aside from looks, the game is solid.  I could play Abyss many times before refusing a play.  The interaction provided with the pearls makes for a fun, tense game that has you work a strategy and hope that you can keep it going.  Great game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Four plays through and I&#039;ve played with two players all the way up through 6.  While it&#039;s definitely a better game with more players, I&#039;m starting to see how there is some replayability problems.  Sure, expansions are being made, but I wonder if the game itself is good enough to invest the $60+ into it.  I&#039;ve also found the game a little difficult to teach as it&#039;s a bit fiddly with mechanics that require you to roll a &#039;3 or less&#039; here and a &#039;4 or more&#039; there.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>It took me a play to learn what the heck I should be doing, and then it took me another play to figure out if this is for me or not.  Well, I STILL can&#039;t say.  I need another play.  Regardless, I don&#039;t see it topping my Top 50 anytime soon, if ever.  The theme is certainly there, it&#039;s just not a theme I enjoy. *update* I have found that I actually enjoy the iOS version much more than the cardboard.  Rarely happens but I would rate it through iOS a 7.5</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Fantastic small viewing of the larger, much longer game.  Plays quickly and has a good amount of variety in each game, provided the expansion is purchased.

Good gateway game, a hit from 2-4 players.  *Update*  Now after a few plays, I&#039;m starting to sour a bit.  When you roll bad it seems like it&#039;s just a horrible thing, even with the token.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I guess it kind of works well, but I don&#039;t find this very inspiring at all.  Something about it just doesn&#039;t flow for me, whether it is niggling issues about the production or gameflow, I&#039;m not sure.  I also don&#039;t like how they put six pawns in the game and expect the game to play well at 6, which I can only imagine would be a nightmare.  Anyway, there are too many great games out there to waste my time with this one.  *Update* - Played once more with the Anniversary Edition and the upgraded component quality does add into my decision to raise from a 5 to a 6.  Also, the game left a better impression from my first few times.  I still think it&#039;s a 3-4 player game, though, as while the dummy player is not as big as annoyance as some, I still don&#039;t like it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;ve been anticipating this game for quite a while, years in the making really.  I&#039;ve been intimidated by the &quot;oldness&quot; of everything, though, and just recently got through the rulebook and spunked up to play.  And after the first mission, I now know that I would have played this every day of my life back in the 80s if I knew about it.  Looking forward to playing some more missions with my guys before rating.  Absolutely GENIUS system, and I can&#039;t imagine how long it took to write up that storybook.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Thanks Udvardis/David for this great birthday present!  And now that I know what I&#039;m doing I think I&#039;ll start to figure it out.  It does take a few plays to get down the overall idea of the game.  I&#039;m not sure that I&#039;m TOO crazy about how it works, though.  I can recognize that it&#039;s a very well-designed game, but I&#039;m not crazy about it (yet).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Excellent family-style game with some great theme.  You can play the game with both kids and adults, but chances are what comes out of your mouth will be quite different in both games!  Rules and layout are intuitive and very easy to understand and have fun with.  Great production!  *Update* - Now that I&#039;ve played three times I realize that the first half of the game is really quite pointless.  Things only get interesting when you&#039;re getting close to the end and trying to figure out how to stop the leader from winning.  So I would say it&#039;s good for a few laughs and at this point it&#039;s probably ready to trot away to find someone else to rut! </comment>	<conditiontext>Great condition.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Having already played Zooloretto, this game is VERY similar.  So of course the first thing I was looking for was which mechanics were different.  I have to admit I didn&#039;t like most of them -- the stacking in the pen was odd to search through for opponents, and I really didn&#039;t like the expandable boards either.   One thing that was terrific were the meeples and their abilities, definitely the best part of the game.  Why are the fields grass?  Should have been water.  Either way, buy Zooloretto instead.</comment>				</item>

Really enjoyed the aspects of picking a tree to level and then flicking my ships to explore and attack.  Can&#039;t wait to play again.  *Update*  Played a few more times and something is bugging me.  The ideas are genius but it goes too long for what I want it to be and the mining mechanic really bugs me.  I actually wish the flicking was a bigger part of the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;ve always liked Dominion -- Ascension to me is perhaps not the better game, but  I find it to be more fun to play.  The art and theme are fabulous and the mechanics of the factions and the center row are very enjoyable to me.  Steadily on the rise as one of my favorites.  *Update* After 10 plays, I still enjoy Ascension, but I did have to lower my rating to an 8.  It doesn&#039;t have a lot of depth to it, so maybe there&#039;s an expansion that can help that.  *Update* From what I&#039;ve seen from the expansion, I&#039;m not pleased.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>My wife and I enjoy this on occasion -- I feel like it runs on a bit longer than it should at times, but it&#039;s a fun exercise in math and evil.  Yup, I said evil -- you can really mess someone up in this game!

*Update* - played with the designer&#039;s rules of not being able to play any cards on your opponent until you fill up your side first.  I&#039;m not sure this is a good idea, in fact, it might be broken.  It causes a lot of situations where you either put a card on your side that hurts you, or makes you discard your hand hoping to find something that you can play.</comment>				</item>

Once you grasp what&#039;s going on, you come to realize how incredible this game is.  Truly has a shot to be one of the best 2-player games and might be my favorite game of 2015.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Terrific civil war game with my favorite war system of all time.  I had already discovered Memoir and Battlelore before BC, and I would place this one right in the middle of them as far as enjoyment goes.  The generals are a neat touch, and the weapons are all very realistic as far as their stats and strategy.  Love that the infantry is so powerful (and rightly so).  Really, there&#039;s not much different here than with the new updated version, so I went ahead and bought this one for a great deal. </comment>				</item>

I am truly impressed with Richard Borg to be able to take the same freaking system and make it feel so different every time.  I find it interesting that most people have said this was easier than the Memoir system -- I found it to have just as many difficult decisions and I LOVED the different feel of the game.  Terrific.</comment>				</item>

I played it with a group of 10 people, and it handled it quite well and quickly to boot.  The artwork is gorgeous as well.</comment>	<conditiontext>Great condition.

Maybe it&#039;s that there is no defined missions -- something about the random event setup, and the Fog of War setup.  I love the game and the universe so I should have this up to 8 or 9 by now, but it&#039;s not there yet.  Grrrrrrr!  I will say that I enjoyed the iOS port quite a bit.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Excellent mix of several games I enjoy, like Stone Age, and the production is outstanding.  Josh Cappel does the art and again blows it out of this world.  The only downside is that there is a pretty good amount of downtime in a 4-to-5 player game.  Still, a winner.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A few things about this one that I found interesting.  First, I don&#039;t care for football very much, but the appeal of this game is not necessarily to football fans.  In fact, there&#039;s not much resembling actually playing a football game.  You play to situations and you try to gain the most fans, not score the most points.  And you do that with a deck of cards for each team that feel very different between them, and each have different strategies.  The concept, to me, is out of the park good.  We&#039;ve played it three times so far, and each time has been enjoyable.  Quick setup time and a good deal of fun in less than an hour.  Looking forward to playing multiplayer.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is a typical heavier Feld, not quite at the level of Trajan but it&#039;s almost there.  There&#039;s goals stacked upon layers and layers of point-making diversions, all packed in a neat theme that is very colorful and bright but perhaps not as thematic as I would like.  Overall, it is a solid brain-burning game but not my favorite of the Felds.</comment>				</item>

I do like that you&#039;re not necessarily given a horse/turtle/camel right from the beginning to bet on.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A good implementation of Carcassonne.  The only thing is, it&#039;s VERY thinky.  If you like thinky and you want a beefed-up Carc, I think this would be a winner for you.  For those of us that are used to the play-and-go Carcassonne style, it&#039;s a bit of a toss-up.  A 6.</comment>				</item>

It makes you focus on quicker scoring methods and takes away some of the advantage of drawing those cloisters.

To start, I&#039;m not completely sold on the game.  It was enjoyable to play, but there isn&#039;t much for me to do while I wait for my turn.  It&#039;s a simple set-collection, auction game that might just grow on me ...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>What a surprise -- another great Feld game.  This might be one of my top heavier games that I&#039;ve played in the past few years.  I like how the dice are used and I don&#039;t feel like there&#039;s a ton going on (like Trajan).  It feels solid and I knew what I was doing quite well in just my first game.  This could prove to be a 9 with more plays.</comment>				</item>

I think every play will be memorable.  It&#039;s shot to the front of my son&#039;s favorite games.  And it&#039;s really a whole different experience with adults!  So fun!  *Update* - would LOVE to get my hands on a Kickstarted 3rd edition.</comment>	<conditiontext>1st edition, player boards are laminated.

Perhaps it makes it even harder than Soloth did! I also love the upgrade cards and all the continued creativity.  Vermin adds more fun to what I believe is the most creative game ever made.

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Just tremendous production and presentation in this game, and the different winning conditions for each god makes the game just appeal so strongly to me.  Add in the wacky theme and the different strategies involved and I&#039;m a HUGE fan!  Quickly becoming one of my favorite games of all time.  *Update* - almost five plays now and I am completely enthralled with every game. *update* -- I played Cthulhu Wars and now I realize that Chaos might be a bit cluttered and clunky.  While this makes me sad and I had to adjust my rating after a recent play, I did love Cthulhu Wars ..</comment>	<conditiontext>Player mats have been laminated.

But the Horned Rat exceeded my expectation and allowed a five-player game in a game that I thought would never allow it.  He worked and he seemed quite fun to play.  My only gripe is that, while the new decks of cards given to the other players are fine, I think I like the old decks better.  But hey, with the game now a 4-5 player game I can&#039;t argue!  By the way, the models for the Rat and his friends are incredible ... Thank you STEPHEN for the great gift!</comment>	<conditiontext>Great condition.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played chess many times in my youth, and really tried to figure it out.  For quite a time I was the best player amongst my friends.  But over the years I have lost interest in it as I have found so many other great games.  I&#039;m not much of an abstract lover in the first place.  Still, a fun experience if your opponent does not take too long to play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Fantastic two-player game.  The depth of scenarios is limitless, and while the game feels like a combination of Descent and the Castle Ravenloft D&amp;D series of board games, it doesn&#039;t have the monotony of the D&amp;D games.  Instant winner for me, can&#039;t wait to dive into the rest of the scenarios and the expansion.  *Update* - it just seemed like more of the same as we went on.  Disappointed.</comment>				</item>

Also a bit concerned about the quality of the stickers on the wood, as it is not painted on and it could peel off with more plays.</comment>				</item>

The formula works well and holds true in this effort, but make no mistake, the theme is what makes this truly shine.  They have done a fantastic job incorporating this through the art and gameplay.

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>I didn&#039;t know what to expect from Core Worlds.  I have grown tired of deckbuilders, and so I had an initial aversion to this one.  But this doesn&#039;t feel as much like a deckbuilders as others do.  There is a splash of Eminent Domain here, but just a tiny splash -- this is a lot more fun to play.  There might be an issue or two at the end as it pertains to turn order and opportunity to get Core planets that you&#039;d like to have, but beyond that, I enjoyed the play and would play again.  Another thing to note is that I won the first time I played, which says a lot about the ability to learn the game as others had played a lot more times than I had.</comment>				</item>

Just not sure how to obtain it yet.  *Update* - I&#039;m done trying to get this one.  There&#039;s just way too many random cards and expansions with more random cards that can change the game at any time without anyone having any idea of it happening.  Along with that you have the trouble of attacking someone that perhaps you didn&#039;t want to attack.  I&#039;m done with this one.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;d say that if you enjoy Cosmic, this is a no-brainer.  The expansion cards do add a lot to the game, and a sixth player is a welcome addition.  I don&#039;t care for the game personally, so this didn&#039;t save it for me.  But as far as value for expansion, I think this is a GREAT expansion.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I have such a high interest in obtaining this game.  Cthulhu Wars made me sit down and learn how to spell Cthulhu.  It takes one of my favorite games ever, Chaos in the Old World, and flips it on its head by making it more approachable and less fiddly than CitOW.  Cthulhu Wars has replaced CitOW for me, and I can&#039;t believe I said it, but I did.  The components, of course, are insanely gorgeous.  There&#039;s tons of expansions and it&#039;s a huge money sink.  But I want the game badly, because it&#039;s great.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>My favorite hybrid game of 2009!  Production is out of this world.  Just love how different all those important prayers to the gods are, and how much they can change the game when done at the right time.  With two players it&#039;s pretty good, with five it was a ton of fun.  *Update* - Hades pushes Cyclades to a 10.  Loved the heroes, new creatures, and Hades!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>Fantastic co-operative game.  It&#039;s come a long way from the PnP I used to play, evolved from a game that was a bit lifeless on printer sheets to glorious in real components, transformed from almost impossible to win to a very balanced and well-done ruleset.  The expansions only add to the joy of the experience and doesn&#039;t bog down the game at all.  And it successfully incorporated perhaps the only co-op I&#039;d want to play competitively with Atlantikwall.  GREAT GAME!</comment>				</item>

I will admit, I am letdown a bit at the final product.  Also, ALWAYS play with the cards.  It makes the game a lot more interesting and it&#039;s not difficult to pick up at all.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>PnP copy.  In a word, fantastic.  I honestly felt like I was playing BSG -- the mechanics are quite different, but all the paranoia and desperation is still there.  It&#039;s almost the freaking same feeling ... in two hours less time.  Fantastic design!  My favorite thing about it is that when you&#039;re rolling dice and really wanting to roll well, and you don&#039;t, and you HAVE to play -- the suspicion is overwhelming.  It&#039;s just pure beauty and we had a great time with the first play.  I hope I hope I hope this can see professional printing one day.  *Update* - my hopes and dreams have been realized.  I played the new copy of Dark Moon yesterday.  It is good, and I enjoyed the play.  I can&#039;t say whether or not how much staying power it has, but I will tell you that it knocks BSG out of the water.  I expect to get plenty of plays out of the new version and congrats to the designer!</comment>				</item>

Love the amount of characters and options available, and the crossroads mechanic is a blast.  Love that there &quot;might&quot; be a traitor each game.  Fantastic work.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Deadlands is a game that I really want to like, but there&#039;s a few dangling mechanics that bother me.  The theme and idea is there and the blind bidding actually works.  But with the different and unbalanced ways to gain victory points, and the ever-changing endgame situation, it really falls flat in the end.  Oh, note to game companies -- if the position of your miniature matters and it&#039;s built into the game&#039;s mechanics, make sure you create a wide enough base that the miniature can stand when you need it to stand.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>16</numplays>			<comment>Two through four, it&#039;s really quite fun all the way around.  Getting into the theme makes it even more enjoyable.  I really enjoy the main mechanics of the game, and although it seems like 120 minutes might be too long, it just feels like a perfect amount of time.  Really enjoy watching the generals make their way across the field and trying to avoid all of those hideous losing conditions!  The more I play it the more I&#039;m enjoying it.</comment>				</item>

Heroquest was my game when I was little, and now HQ grew up and here it is.  My wife and I are in the middle of painting all the minis for this wonderful game.  The campaign rules created with Road to Legend are awesome.  One of my favorite games of all time.  Just wish I could play it more.</comment>	<conditiontext>Fully painted.

	<numplays>19</numplays>			<comment>I was a huge proponent of Descent (first edition).  Dungeon crawls speak to me, and Descent 1e has always stood out to be as the best dungeon crawler available.  Personally, 2e has blown 1e away so far.  The only flaw I had with 1e was the length.  2e fixes that, and the way it was fixed (that I initially feared) is a stroke of genius, and works, and is highly enjoyable.  Being able to integrate 1e into the new edition is a huge plus.  Everything is just lovely.  I will own it forever.</comment>				</item>

It takes a lot of dedication.  I really don&#039;t see myself getting it to the table much more, with all the other great games out there.  Maybe one day.  *Update* - Sold for $80.</comment>				</item>

I like that you can do so many things with the cards, but the problem is that unlike games where you can have several options that you want to do with multi-use cards, this one gave me lots of options but I just didn&#039;t want to do many of those actions.  Many turns would go by that I just felt like I didn&#039;t do anything on, and that was the issue.  Oh well.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I love the idea of Dimension, and the components are just top notch beautiful.  The game itself is just so quick and I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s too difficult, either.  Once the correct rules are used for bonus points it doesn&#039;t seem tough at all.  I&#039;m up in the air about this one, but as a puzzle fan, I&#039;d like to keep it around for a while.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Wow - so after one play, I&#039;m inclined to give this a 9.  Due to player elimination, though, I have to hesitantly place it at 8 for now.  But the experience is just so much fun, and tense as heck.  For a game with such SIMPLE rules, it has amazing depth and tension.  I loved our first play.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Probably the old Avalon Hill version with the blocks.</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>One of the few heavier games that I&#039;ve played that I&#039;ve enjoyed.  Of course, being worker placement and area control does influence my rating quite a bit.  It&#039;s fun and very combative, but in the end, it&#039;s quite long (4 hours for three players) and there are some REALLY powerful cards in there.  Solid game though.  And oh yeah, I won my first play, so that helps too!  But really, quite thematic for this type of game and although I was spent at the end, I had fun.</comment>				</item>

Also, this is a terrific entry-level strategy game for youngsters, but definitely enough there for adults who like the light-strategy genre.  I rate it an 8 with two players, and a 7 for more players -- there is more control with 2.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>This is a nasty, evil, cutthroat game of negotiation.  The threats that are laid out around the table in this one can be catastrophic for acquaintances, though, so unless you are playing with some friends that &quot;leave it all at the table&quot; I suggest you skip this one!  But for those that enjoy a great time, definitely look it up.  I&#039;m sure it&#039;s OOP these days, but it deserves to be in print no doubt.  And I&#039;ve found that it plays very well between 3-6.  Just definitely play with the advanced rules!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Definitely recommend playing this with the variant of &#039;escaping with the treasure&#039;.  Finding eight coins and trying to get out is SO MUCH more satisfying than just collecting 10 coins and winning the game.</comment>				</item>

The theme doesn&#039;t come through as well as I would have liked, but honestly, it&#039;s a solid, fun romp.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>After playing this a few more times, I&#039;m sad to say that it&#039;s really fallen out of favor with me.  Components are a HUGE 10, and the theme is just great (so is the art).  For me, the scoring mechanic in this one of making a move and having to check who is where, what hits what, etc x20 tied it down and made it blah.  It just doesn&#039;t *feel* quite the way I&#039;d like it to.  But definitely a game that is unique and one that is worth playing some time.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Just so wacky, which is why I really like it!  Party games need to be creative and have a distinct feel to them.  This does both of those things quite well.  Great, unique art also.  Probably not a keeper but a fun pastime for now.  *Update* - found out that it&#039;s truly a winner at 5+ players.  As long as you don&#039;t mind a little downtime, which is fine because you are still involved rooting for your teammates.  Unique party game.</comment>				</item>

But I didn&#039;t enjoy it -- I didn&#039;t feel the theme as much as I wanted, and I felt like I was just doing accounting opposed to having fun.

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>This is what I would call an experience game.  It&#039;s not so much whether you win or lose as the fact that&#039;s it&#039;s quite fun to play and enjoy what happens.  That said, there are still fun decisions to make, even though a card might come up that makes you do something you don&#039;t want to do.  I love how the scenarios can be replayed as well, with no concerns of repeating anything.  It&#039;s a genius system, no doubt, and will certainly be expanded and enjoyed for many years to come.  *Update* - 10 plays in and I&#039;m finding this system to be a bit uninspired.  I&#039;m not sure whether it&#039;s the blandness of the graphic design or whether the mechanics don&#039;t feel fresh anymore, but something has definitely been lost here.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Wow!  This might be my favorite euro of 2009.  It reminds me of a more-involved Stone Age, which is a terrific thing.  I just like how everything seems very complicated to start, but how it just flows very easily once you start in.  I was very competitive in my first game which tells me it does well in that area.  Great game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I think ED is a good game.  It feels like the designer has meshed together Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome, and Dominion to create it.  It&#039;s really stunning how the game has taken major parts of those three games to create this and that the game works well enough!  So while it is not an original idea to be sure, it works fine and I thought it was okay.  But is it better than any of those games?  No, I don&#039;t think so.  Maybe better than GtR, but not the others.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a solid game with some neat dual-card abilities.  But let&#039;s be honest and say it&#039;s a variant of Lost Cities.  A lot of times it allows me to do something I wish I could do in Lost Cities, but does that mean we&#039;re dumbing down my decisions or giving me more?  Interesting.  And I wish there were more cards in the deck, the game ends very quickly.  I wish them the best.</comment>				</item>

I already love real-time games, and this takes real-time to a very fun level rolling dice.  The quick playtime allows it to come out often and the party atmosphere always makes it a good time.

For now, enjoying it very much and I love how different a feel it has than everything else out there.  I look forward to more Expedition games, by the way ...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is a game that you don&#039;t necessarily need to know the theme to play, but might be essential in order to enjoy it.  The mechanics are mostly pick up and deliver, which fits the theme well -- but without the theme, it would seem quite dry.  I like that there are some open-endedness with the jobs, though, although the traveling is a bit much at times.  Even after all that, the theme is fun, and I would much rather play it over Merchant of Venus.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>So this is probably my least favorite expansion, because I think between you and me, I believe this is when Flash Point jumped the shark.  I really dug the two-story building and I liked the variety and creativity of some of the other boards from other sets.  Extreme Danger seemed to add a bit too much to the game for my taste.  The garage was more frustrating than fun to me, and the laboratory felt like it was pushing the system farther than it should be pushed.  In addition, I don&#039;t really think I would want to add the attic or basement to any map.  Three floors really stretches the boundary of what this system can do.  Regardless, the game is fantastic.</comment>	<conditiontext>Opened, great condition.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Wowsers!  Honestly, I played this with the best possible group that could ever play it.  Fluffy Bunny Tea Party with Atticus is a dream come true.  And we had fun impersonating high-society bunnies with British accents.  So it was a good, fun experience -- for the first time.  I can&#039;t imagine that this could continue to be amazing, because the game itself sucked.  But I gave it a 5 for the fun first time.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Fortune and Glory, by itself, is a passable game.  I&#039;d give it a 6, probably, if I hadn&#039;t played other Flying Frog titles.  And there&#039;s the rub -- I love Last Night on Earth and it has a solid spot in my heart.  But FF has made four games since then -- Invasion from Outer Space (a LNoE clone), A Touch of Evil (a somewhat-creative game that I didn&#039;t enjoy), Conquest of Planet Earth (would love to play this co-op), and now this.  Well, five games later, and I&#039;m still seeing 90% of this game having LNoE mechanics.  I mean, come on.  It makes for a repetitive, almost dull experience to keep having the same things in their games.  And I see what they were trying to do here, and it&#039;s a great effort, it is.  But man, the collapsing of temples and cliffhangers and everything -- I didn&#039;t like ANY of it.  The rest is just stuff I&#039;ve seen before.  I haven&#039;t played CoPE yet, but I&#039;m willing to bet that some of the same mechanics are in that one too.  FF better step it up with the next game.  Come on guys, you have a great company, but FanG was a step back.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Certainly not a 45-min game, our first game with four players was two hours.  Lends itself to a lot of AP.  That said, wonderful theme and production.  I&#039;m not in love with it, but I did enjoy the play.  *Update* - second play in the books and I&#039;m still quite frustrated with it.  I want to like it but I don&#039;t, and that&#039;s not going to change at this point.  There&#039;s something that bugs me about the design and that just can&#039;t be adjusted to.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>I found both this one and Robinson Crusoe around the same time and I&#039;m feeling quite fortunate these days.  This game works.  The movement mechanics are, yes, borrowed but in no way does it feel forced.  It works GREAT with the game and they did a fantastic job with this.  The character powers and upgrades are a blast and the scenarios have been well thought-out so far.  Painting the figures and keeping this one for a long time.  </comment>	<conditiontext>Almost completely painted.  Played several times.  Great condition.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The theme made this playable for me, but halfway through I felt like I wanted out.  If you&#039;re looking for this type of experience, I&#039;d say to just play Diplomacy.  There&#039;s too many clunky mechanics for me in this, things that just seem to draw out the game.  And releasing the first edition without those fixes (the ports) is just inexcusable.  The theme really carried me through and made it okay.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Absolutely BEAUTIFUL art and components.  Most likely the most gorgeous card game I&#039;ve seen to date.  The game itself is okay.  I felt like it&#039;s just saturated with stages and it&#039;s just so complicated and involved.  You really need to know exactly what other cards people have and what they do, so perhaps after a number of plays I could see enjoying the game more, but with the length of play with four players I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m going to be playing it that much.  Still, for fans of card combat games, it&#039;s excellent.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The game itself is fine, although VERY short.  If the game consisted of simply the second round, I&#039;d think it would be fair or so.  The first round is a auction-type round, and it&#039;s just downright silly and might last longer than the actual gameplay.  Donald X, not sure this is a good one.  </comment>				</item>

It did a good job with both, but not enough to keep around.  The simplistic mechanics isn&#039;t good enough these days, and doesn&#039;t stack up against competitors like Tokaido.</comment>				</item>

The component quality is great and it really adds to the flavor of the game.

At this point I would have to say that Ghost Stories is reaching the level of Pandemic for me, and perhaps is poised to overtake it.  *Update* - 10 plays through and I&#039;ve increased the rating from 9 to 10.  I LOVE Ghost Stories.  And the expansion is incredible too.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s a must-have for me, as it cranks up the fun and incorporates a good amount of new things, but the complexity level stays the same.  It just feels like a fresh way to play the game and doesn&#039;t inhibit the experience in any way, just adds to it.  I love Su-Leng and the balance she gives to all the naughtiness going down.  Great expansion!  Thanks Tony for the great gift!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Uh-oh.  I thought I would like this game.  I did not.  Glen More is so abstract and so tedious I wanted to quit before the end.  Perhaps I&#039;m being too harsh with that sentence but by the time the end did come I got rather upset with the scoring system.  It&#039;s just not for me, I guess.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I went in not expecting much and came out with a pretty positive impression on a very fun game.  It&#039;s a race game at its heart, but to win the race you have to not only do a smart job at creating your own resources and buildings but you have to screw over your opponent as well.  Very fun!  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Definitely a game that requires me to play once just to understand.  After the first play, you can really get a handle on the different strategies.  One of those games that I acknowledge is a good game, but not one that I enjoy.  *Update* - second play was better than the first.  Still not a fan of the mechanics and lack of theme, but a good game.  It&#039;s just not FUN.</comment>				</item>

The theme is a disconnect, but it&#039;s still fun to play with tikis and such.  Worker placement is a winning mechanic for me, too, so I liked it very much.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Robo Rally meets pick up and deliver game.  It plays very well and runs smooth, but there&#039;s such a huge luck element to where things end up that it makes it a bit hard to plan.  It also gives you that terrible feeling of making a great plan for a turn and then realizing right in the middle that you can&#039;t change it so your turn is pretty much wasted.  But, if you feel like a game with some chaos, it&#039;s a great fun option!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Interesting abstract with gorgeous components.  Not sure the game would be as good without the components, but there are some clever ideas here for the abstract fans.  Definitely takes a few plays to get your head around it, but a very good abstract that I would recommend.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I think it&#039;s good for a couple plays, but a couple things annoy me.  First, my son didn&#039;t care for it too much.  He felt like it was quite punishing, and since you are relying a lot on what you roll, this can be true.  Second, I really don&#039;t like that the game was obviously built with the intention that we buy all the expansions to make it a complete game.  Right in the rules, it says to keep playing on the expansion board that to my knowledge is not even out yet.  The game is okay, but this is not a keeper for me.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>You know, for an older roll-and-move game, I enjoyed this.  Much better than Monopoly, because there are more choices involved and the game has a solid ending time to it (it can&#039;t go on and on).  Beautiful components and a fun board to look at.  With some touching-up, this could be put back in print and do very well.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Innovation is certainly a creative game.  I really like the different things you can do with your cards.  It does help to have a strong knowledge of all the cards and what they can do, though.  I also can see why it has its detractors -- it&#039;s not easy to have things taken away just because someone happened to draw a certain card.  Poor Sam had to suffer through two games of getting owned and poor card draws.  If I had that kind of game I might look differently on it, but for now, I&#039;d certainly play it again and enjoyed the first two plays enough.</comment>				</item>

The game is actually quite fun and I would play again, but I wasn&#039;t too hot on all the random cards that came out and the rest of the luck involved.  I mean, I like luck, but yikes!  A little too much for me.  Still fun, though, we still love ya Bruno.</comment>				</item>

Unfortunately, I&#039;ve found that the enormous swings of luck can make this a bit annoying at times, and the two-player games that we played of this were just okay.</comment>				</item>

Would love to play again.  *Update* - now that I have, it just seems that the rules aren&#039;t solid enough to provide a fantastic experience every time.  The last time we played, while fun, was a bit &quot;empty&quot;.  I&#039;d play it again, but it&#039;s off the wishlist.</comment>				</item>

Maybe we played something wrong, but it seemed like you would build up your forces, take a shot at attacking, and then regroup and do it again.  Odd point disbursement.

It&#039;s a good, solid game, but Tokyo gets played rarely enough that when we do play it, we get the KoT experience.  If you&#039;ve played a ton of KoT, perhaps NY would help.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>A true winner of a push-your-luck style game.  The art is fantastic, the mechanics are simple, and the cards thrown in really make it what it is.  Genius system that provides a party-type atmosphere and lots of trash talk.  That said, it can be riotously long for what it is, and it is quite devoid of strategy.  It is fun to play at times, at others I would pass it up.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>30</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s taken me three plays to truly appreciate Kingdom Builder, but I&#039;m liking the game more each time I play it.  The first time you play you just feel a bit lost, even though the rules are so simple.  More plays get you a lot more comfortable with the system.  I think this is going to become more of a winner as time goes on and expansions continue to be released.  *Update* - 20 plays through and I still can&#039;t get enough.  A true played 10. *Second Update* I&#039;ve hit 30, but I can&#039;t say this is still a 10 anymore.  It&#039;s starting to lose it&#039;s luster for me.  But heck, 30 plays!</comment>				</item>

Loving the new powers (especially the caravan!), really adds to the base game fluidly, and the new nomad spaces add some extra fun.  The new objectives are also very well done.  *Update* - I lowered my rating a bit because I&#039;ve found that some of the new powers cause some AP than usual.  Not just that, but I&#039;m just not digging some of the new goals.  I wouldn&#039;t call the expansion essential.</comment>	<conditiontext>Great condition, stored in original box.

The theme is okay and this instantly becomes the best Christian game I&#039;ve played -- and that&#039;s awesome.  Very excited about that part of this game.  The rest, meh.</comment>				</item>

Good tactical play, but compared to some of my tactical favorites (Summoner Wars, Imperial Assault) it just didn&#039;t pack the same kind of punch.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Great, quick dice-roller with some good decisions.  Sure, there are several games like this, but Vegas doesn&#039;t pretend to give you something that it shouldn&#039;t.  It&#039;s about VEGAS, and so there&#039;s going to be some luck involved.  Honestly, adding the white dice raises the game from a 7 to an 8 in my view.  I really, really enjoy it with the white dice and it&#039;s been a success for me 2-5 players.</comment>				</item>

I have to think that at this point this is perhaps the one game in my collection that I will never part with.  After almost 30 plays each different game is epic and tells a completely different story than the next.  Can&#039;t wait for more scenarios!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Where do I start?  The game in itself is almost broken.  The random timer is an okay idea, but the nature of the game doesn&#039;t allow you to have much time at all to get out a word, especially if you&#039;re playing with four or more players.  I can&#039;t see a scenario where 7 players are quick enough to get one category of words all the way around the table in the time allowed.  Also, the mechanics of the game just aren&#039;t good -- it&#039;s easy to learn, but it&#039;s also easy to get stuck with a poor topic or letter.  I just didn&#039;t like anything about it</comment>				</item>

There are some things that bother me, such as the Ascension-like running cards, but at least they don&#039;t refresh every turn and the ideas are somewhat new.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>A bit disappointed in this one.  I had high hopes from the beginning, but it occurred to me after playing one quest that the next time I played it, it&#039;s going to be just too similar.  I know that things are going to be in different places, but it&#039;s just frightening to think about the replayability factor.  Still, it&#039;s a solid idea and a wonderful first game from the great Menzel. *Update* - I&#039;m giving it another go-through.  I think this would be best to play solo or with people that I know better. *Update 2* - I&#039;ve played several times solo and I just can&#039;t get excited about this.  There&#039;s just something about this game that I can&#039;t get behind.  I wish I could!</comment>	<conditiontext>Great condition, played a couple times.</conditiontext>			</item>

While the mechanics aren&#039;t super, the game is really, really fun and will leave you with some great memories of backstabbing and joy.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Wow, this is just a cutthroat dirty little game.  I love me some negotiation games but this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth mostly because of player elimination being entirely possible, and that&#039;s a no-no in my book.  Really nice production and I&#039;d like to have liked it, but the game seems against you from the start and the battle against others is too susceptible to group think.  Not for me!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I was introduced to this one back in 2003, and it really is a blast.  By far the best speed game I have played, it might take playing it with family to get the most enjoyment out of it, but in itself for such an old game I think it stands up quite well as a true classic.  But don&#039;t be fooled, this is NOT a 2-player game or even a 3-player game.  Play it with 4 (or more with another set).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A neat little game with several clever mechanics thrown together.  It&#039;s almost what I would consider a light euro once you get the flow of the game going, and I enjoyed the different paths to victory.  I&#039;ve only played Wallace&#039;s Runebound, and London was a nice view on what some of his other games might be like.  While I&#039;m not crazy about it, I&#039;d certainly enjoy another play anytime.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>55</numplays>			<comment>The first FFG card game that actually makes sense to me and makes me want to continue to play it.  Many folks have bashed just the base set to me, but honestly I have enjoyed my four solo plays very much.  Perhaps it&#039;s the theme, but the game works and has already provided some exciting moments!  *Update* - now that I am playing this with my 8-year-old son and building decks, it is one of my favorite games to play. *Another update* - Staying power was a problem for me, as I feel like I don&#039;t want to invest anymore into new decks and strategies.  The original game plus a few expansions seems about right for my level of interest.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>The basic mechanics are quite simple, but figuring out a good strategy is quite challenging.  It&#039;s like mixing Acquire with a whole bunch of luck, but it costs a LOT of money to try that luck out, so it only rears its head so often.  Just like Vegas, you can put a lot to chance in this game and end up empty-handed for the most part, but it&#039;s quite exhilarating when it works out!  Can&#039;t say I&#039;ve played anything like it before!  Fun.</comment>				</item>

This game has survived the test of time and I imagine it will be around here for quite a while, as well.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s solid and fine, but I&#039;m just not that excited when I sit down to play.  I view it as a time-filler that works well.  A solid experience for what it is, not a great one.  *Update* - okay, it&#039;s fun ...</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s also serviceable in that it creates a space to throw your dice and hit the other players&#039; dice out.  This is a fun game that doesn&#039;t last too long and can be a true winner in a raucous atmosphere.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>One of the best euros of 2010 -- Feld does it again for me in back-to-back years (Macao).  Luna is intimidating at first, and does lend to a bit of AP due to future-planning, but the experience is totally worth it.  Just an excellent game, and gorgeous to boot!  *Update* Quickly becoming one of my favorite euros of all time.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>Macao has to be one of my favorite euros from 2009.  Love the dice mechanic in it and all the different paths to victory.  I could play it many times and still enjoy it.  I guess I could wish for a different theme, but hey -- in this instance, the mechanic is so great I can live with it.  Also plays great with 2-4.  A stronger theme would put this to a 9.</comment>				</item>

I think there&#039;s a bit too much randomness involved and too much hoping to draw a card that you need, but the system is very sound and it&#039;s a lot of fun.  *Update* - picked up the Red and Green decks from the Duels of the Planeswalkers.

Make and Break Party has you doing a building exercise that is fun and doesn&#039;t take a long time, keeps everyone involved, and is involved and exciting.  A winner.  I don&#039;t recommend playing the entire board, though.  It can be a bit lengthy ...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Neat theme and kind of felt like a lite version of Ra.  Very thematic in scoring where Ra might not feel as attached.  I guess the only thing that took the game down a bit is the selection process -- while I think that after a few plays I could perceive it better, it seemed like it was just really, really difficult to get exactly what you wanted.  But some neat ideas here and a fun one!</comment>				</item>

The game itself was a fun bidding game that used victory points as the bid, very intriguing.  Things went a bit slow for my liking.  Then again, we did play with six, so perhaps a lower number is it&#039;s best bet.</comment>				</item>

What other games can boast that?  Memoir is a ton of fun and if you can afford all the expansions, well worth it. *Update* - I&#039;ve decided that I like Memoir better than Battlelore!  The system is easier, quicker, and cleaner.</comment>				</item>

I imagine the second edition will be tons better.  The fun is definitely there, and I like pick-up and deliver.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>FFG</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>This is superior to the first in graphics and perhaps gameplay, although I don&#039;t have eyes to play the advanced version.  The base game itself is good enough in my mind, for when you are of mood.  It&#039;s probably the first pick-up-and-deliver game, and it might be the best.</comment>				</item>

One of the most underrated games out there.  Incredible how great a game you can have with just a small page of rules.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>As a straight-up game, I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s entirely special or not.  It&#039;s certainly beautiful, with gorgeous miniatures and very nice graphic design and art.  But the stories DO make it special, and with it being co-operative, it makes it very fun to team up with children.  They really get into the stories and enjoy it, as do I.  Plaid Hat is known for their storylines in their games, and this is proof positive of that.  Fun game and I look forward to expansions.</comment>				</item>

Also adore the theme. *Update* - not sure what I was thinking.  Played recently and there&#039;s no way to plan  your turn due to all the randomness.  It&#039;s a fun idea and a cool implementation, but I was feeling more frustrated than anything.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I guess the main problem I have with Munchkin is the basis of the game itself.  It&#039;s just random draws from a stack of cards, with no way to prepare for future turns or have any idea what&#039;s coming or going.  And games that have a variable ending time really bug me too.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>If this is a good indicator of rondel games, I will have to pass.  It just felt like we were taking turns doing the same thing.  It was balanced enough, almost too balanced actually, to the point where I didn&#039;t feel I was doing anything important several turns.  I actually started to get BORED near the end.  Perhaps i&#039;m not a fan of economic games, but this one was one of the worst I&#039;ve played.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s hard to put my finger on this one.  I thought it was fun, but there is a lot that bothers me as well.  You have to go into it with the mindset that small things are better.  And I recommend not playing it with 5 players, because there&#039;s absolutely no way to plan any kind of power move.  By the time it gets to your turn again, the surveyors have likely moved on and you have likely been removed from the board.  I&#039;d like to try it with 3-4 players, though.</comment>				</item>

After playing it quite wrong the first time due to the hideous rulebook, I tried it again this month and even with playing it right, I came away with an &#039;eh&#039;. It&#039;s gorgeous and family-oriented and light-strategy -- all things I LOVE in my eurogames. But I can&#039;t help feeling that it could go on FOREVER, and the aggravation involved in trying to get your boats back is at times hideous. </comment>				</item>

But something about the way the game goes, whether its the bidding or the art on the tiles, bothers me.  I&#039;m happy I played it, though.  Oh, and for the record, this is one of the worst box covers in history.</comment>				</item>

Unfortunately my first play was interrupted by my darling one-year-old, so I will have to wait for a second play to rate.  *Update* - thanks Cameron and the Rancho gamers for this great gift!  Played a second time at home with the family and it&#039;s a hit.  Realy like the use of dice with the puzzle aspect.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>There&#039;s some things I really like about Pantheon.  You can tell it&#039;s the same designer as Stone Age, as you have a progressive build throughout the game and many strategic options to take.  I liked it just fine.  I guess the main trouble I had with it was that the theme seemed very uninspired.  The feet meeples were rather lame, and the art and board didn&#039;t really get me excited at all.  The box is HUGE and certainly doesn&#039;t have to be.  I wish that the presentation had a bit more and I could see myself purchasing it and enjoying it more.  The game itself though, is good, not great, and that in the long run is what will hold up the purchase.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Quickly morphing into one of our favorite two-player games.  Beautiful presentation and enough fun choices and experiences to fill up a half-hour.  The cards can certainly go against you, but being a short game it&#039;s not really a flaw in my mind.  You can still get a good strategy going with what is provided to you.</comment>				</item>

So while the game was a bit long, it was also a blast.  The new &quot;Crusades&quot; spot is essential and much used.  Liked it very much.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Now here&#039;s a game that you play if you want to have fun.  Get into the theme and roll those dice.  Fun light strategy mayhem.  A lot of luck, but it doesn&#039;t bother me in the least because I was having a good time.  *Update* - played with an older more experienced crowd and found out what the fuss was all about.  After that session I&#039;m a solid fan of Pirate&#039;s Cove -- it was tense and exciting the whole time.  Plus, we played with five players, which is certainly an upgrade over three.</comment>				</item>

I enjoyed the auction stage, I really like the management of money for the three stages, and I like the graphics and presentation of the game.  This is a serious winner for me and I can&#039;t wait to play again!  With 3 I found it quite fun, with 6 it is enjoyable, but there is a lot of waiting between turns.  Certainly bad to be leader in a 6-player game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is an excellent example of a game that, in my opinion, is a classic in every sense of the word but has been replaced and redone to make it better in the future.  I recognize fully that the game was great in its time.  But playing it 14 years later after release I just can&#039;t get into it.  I feel like Colosseum, who PoF is always compared to, is actually quite a different game indeed.  Scoring throughout really changes the way to play.  A good game by all accounts.  Would have played the crap out of it 14 years ago.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>I am in love with the idea, but the game itself feels a bit short and too light for what I&#039;d like.  Hoping for an expansion that makes it a bit better, but I really dig the concept.  Played again with experienced players and found it more fun.  Also, the track should always be on 20.  If you go into it with a silly mindset, you&#039;ll enjoy it.</comment>				</item>

The online client at keldon.net is gorgeous and gives the game some life for me.  But honestly, the game is still so bloody confusing, and that certainly takes away from the enjoyment.  ** Now another recent play in the books and I have to admit I enjoyed it.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A fun little co-op that has a few clever twists to it.  The theme is ripe as well, as zany a theme as it is.  Definitely should have been published in a bigger box, though. *update* - Some of my first-play fears were realized in my second play.  So much randomness!  It still was fun, but the game itself is more of a &quot;collect items, hope you don&#039;t lose them to randomness, wait till something bad happens, fix it, die&quot;  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>A great social deduction game.  It&#039;s fast and contains a lot of bang for a small package.  Looking forward to trying the included expansion, as my initial impression is that it will be very difficult for the Resistance to win with the basic game (that was with 10 players).  *Update* - played now 8 times, and have really enjoyed it!  The plot cards are fun but it seems that it would be very hard for the spies to win with them in play.  Overall, I&#039;ve found it to be about even in who wins.  A fabulous filler and its becoming a favorite.</comment>				</item>

Will check back.  *Update* turns out the idea itself was grand, and I enjoyed the played very much in spite of Risk and more because of Legacy.

The presentation, art, and mechanics are all wonderfully integrated into a fantastic presentation that is certainly not easy to win.  There is a lot going on, but when you look at the amount of missions you get in the game and how varied everything is, you could play this for quite a while.  Great game!</comment>				</item>

RttA is a great graduation of that system and I enjoy it very much!  There&#039;s also nothing like rolling some skulls and attacking your friends.  Turns out this is a very enjoyable solo timekill as well - top score of 79 solo!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Well, well -- I bought this for the solo aspect and haven&#039;t been disappointed one bit.  If I need to have an evening to unwind and wrap myself in a story through gaming, this is the one that gets pulled off the shelf.  Several games are playable with solo play, but if you use the Threat Track, I feel that Runebound is in the Top 3 of what I have seen out there.  Some choice expansions make the game even better.  And of course, I&#039;m a big fan of Terrinoth.</comment>	<conditiontext>Upgraded components include printed out and laminated Threat Track for solo play and replaced all cardboard gem tokens with colored &quot;pebbles&quot; from Michael&#039;s.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I like racing games, and I would have thought I would love destroying other racers, but there are several numbers involved in the destruction that you have to try to remember, and there doesn&#039;t seem to be a set scale to decide which damage hits.  This means you are forced to open the rulebook every time you want to destroy someone.  It&#039;s just really annoying for me, and takes the fun out of the &quot;advanced&quot; version, which is the one I would be interested in playing.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>There&#039;s no doubt RR is a good game.  I like it ... but something is keeping me from listing it as a favorite euro.  The way the tracks operate is, to me, confusing.  And in repeat plays I am struggling with not being a tad bored with the tracks and what to do.  I want it to be a classic!  I do.  I&#039;ll keep on playing and see what happens.</comment>				</item>

I am worried that multiple plays will make it feel a little samey, and there wasn&#039;t that amazing UNNGH! to it like I feel with a similar game, Roll Through the Ages.  Still, very creative use of spatial awareness and I like the dice mechanic used in this way.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I started out very unimpressed with Saint Petersburg, as I found the art hideous and the gameplay rather uninspiring.  Well, a few more plays and I&#039;m sold.  I even find the art comical now. A favorite online experience.  I guess one of the things that bug me about this one is that every turn there is something that you&#039;re &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing.  I like a bit more randomness to my decisions.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Samurai Battles is another great Borg design -- unfortunately, it stops right there and doesn&#039;t surpass the rest of his designs in my mind.  The mechanics are thematically and carry through well, but it might just be a combination of the theme and the gameplay, but it doesn&#039;t sing to me like the other iterations.  Also, the minis are very, very fragile and difficult to play with.  But a good try and if you&#039;re into this time period, this is a winner.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>The first few times I played Seasons, I was excited.  It is fresh and beautiful, and it incorporates a Magic feel to the mechanics without making you play magic.  It scales great from 2-4 as well.  The only issue is that played with the wrong people, there is AP.  I also haven&#039;t liked what I have read about the first expansion.  Regardless, I&#039;d still like a copy, because it&#039;s a fun and clever game.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Especially fun with a good group, Shadows delivers a lot of excitement.  Interesting that there might not be a traitor at all.  A good challenge!  Beautiful production.  I feel like perhaps I am not enjoying the game as much as I first did, just because the effort that you put into an action sometimes feels like you&#039;re just doing something negative.  But it&#039;s just such a gorgeous game it&#039;s hard for me to let go.  *Update* - I&#039;m letting go.  Too long and not enough substance, and while the traitor element is fun it&#039;s just not as amazing as I want it to be.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>There are, at least, some movement decisions here.  And the card-driven movement was, I&#039;m sure, a big deal at the time.  *Update* - I played this with my son and cousin the other day, and I realized it was broken.  With the card pulls, it&#039;s entirely possible you could be playing Sorry! for your entire life, and also entirely possible that you never get a guy out of start.  No good.  Avoid!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I wanted to love it ... but I guess it wasn&#039;t quite right for me.  It just seemed to go a bit long.  Love the concept and ideas, but two hours of flicking a disc or doing a mini-puzzle just wasn&#039;t engaging enough.  Plus, there are turns that some folks won&#039;t be doing anything.  Maybe if everyone could do ALL of their turns at the same time, it would speed it up.  There was a lot of downtime and that&#039;s the part I wish would go away.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>I acquired two copies of this for 8-player action.  Needless to say, it&#039;s not for everyone!  But if I&#039;m feeling like 30 minutes of chaotic action, here you go! *Update* - Turns out 8 players might be even more chaotic than even I desire.  I&#039;ll keep the one copy as I enjoyed the 3-player game.  *Update* - Played it 4-player, and it was fantastic.  Really fun.  Bumped by rating up to 9 because I enjoy it so much and because it&#039;s so freaking wacky.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Terrific bidding game for 4-5.  Very small amount of money to work with, so you have to watch closely what others are doing and make your decisions based off of that.  Clever mechanics and with such a short play time and teachability, I really love it.  It&#039;s sometimes just so agonizing, which makes it so fun!  Beware, not a two-player game!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>It took me 10 plays before I began to write this comment.  The main reason for that is twofold:  1) How can I describe correctly enough what might be my favorite merge of all time (Descent/Star Wars) 2) What do I do with Descent?  So that&#039;s my problem here -- I&#039;m afraid that Imperial Assault has somehow replaced my beloved Descent, and I don&#039;t know how to react to that.  I just know that I really love playing Imperial Assault!  Excellent, better-crafted campaign.  Fantastic minis that look great painted up.  Two different games in one box that are both excellent.  Seriously, the two-player Skirmish out of the box is really well done!  So for now, I&#039;m all in, and we&#039;ll see where this goes. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I have to thank ATTICUS for hooking me up with a play on this bad boy.  Such a creative system invented for this one, that truly mimics the great end of Episode 1.  The mechanics are spot on and really make this feel like a unique, epic game, which is exactly the way it should feel.  Would love to grab a copy and play it once a year, because that&#039;s what it is, it&#039;s an experience game and it needs to be experienced and enjoyed.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>out of print</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Beautiful ships, but the gameplay didn&#039;t strike me too strong.  I don&#039;t really care for the vanilla game with just moving and shooting, and the advanced rules seem to make things just too difficult for me to enjoy the system.  Which is a shame, because I love SW.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>So happy to have a chance to play this -- it&#039;s a component whore&#039;s dream!  Very entertaining game as well, if it was a bit shorter I would never play Settlers again.  Really enjoyed the thematic look and feel of the game.  Catan in space adds a lot of great ideas to the franchise, and the goober in this game is ULTRA cool. I seriously love the components and I really like the gameplay as well. The only downer is the time, especially when you add in the expansion. Still, I&#039;d play again in a heartbeat.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Style adds some new wrinkles and in some ways, the game feels almost like a different one.  The new card acquisition space that uses decorations to obtain cards is a busy spot, and I really like the addition of the style board.  I could go either way on the 5th player, it is nice to have but it does make the game a bit longer.  This would have gotten a 7.5 but they folded the board wrong, and now there&#039;s a nice crease in it.  That really takes away from the beautiful art of the game.  Why even use a folded board?  Very poor thought there.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>32</numplays>			<comment>Quite possibly one of the best card games I&#039;ve played.  You can almost SEE the miniatures out there fighting.  Four players might not be recommended, though, as it takes the game a bit longer than what it should be.  Still, incredible depth with simple rules almost always makes a game great to me.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The Cloaks are such a deceiving army.  At first glance, their units don&#039;t seem as powerful as others, but where they get you is their versatility.  The summoner is extremely versatile, and the event cards and heroes these guys can put out there can really fluster and psychologically get to you.  I&#039;ve thrown several armies against them and I&#039;ve either lost or barely won each time.  Great, balanced army!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The first thing I&#039;ll mention on these is that I love how the traditional outlook of these races are used quite differently in the game.  Sure, the goblins stick pretty close to the &quot;rushing, sneaking goblins&quot; that we usually see, but those armies in other games usually get squashed to bits.  In SW, the goblins are a blast to play and they do quite well.  The Dwarves focus on destroying walls and they have plenty of heavy hitters and good shields to do it.  The distinct feel of both armies is terrific and there&#039;s so many different strategies to use when combined with the reinforcement deck.  The best of the two starter packs, by far.

The mutant plays are great fun and always surprising to the opponent, and there&#039;s a lot of flexibility in the ways you can play the army.  One of the stronger armies I&#039;ve seen so far.  The summoner is good, too, being able to build magic quite easily every turn if you work it right.  Great deck!</comment>				</item>

I never got a chance to play Survive! when I was a kid, and that&#039;s a shame, because I&#039;m positive I would have enjoyed it very much.  I haven&#039;t seen the old version, but the new one is FANTASTIC.  It&#039;s a gorgeous game to look at and really pleasing to the eye.  But above all, the entire family had a great time escaping to the outer islands, pleading and begging not to be eaten by sharks, and capsizing their parents boats (grumble grumble ...)  This will win Reprint of the Year, and Stronghold Games is to be commended for such great work.  I rate Survive! a 7 for now, but it&#039;s one of those games that I think will grow in rating over time, opposed to drop.  *Update* - played with the squids, and yep, the game is now an 8.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>What a terrific theme.  Unfortunately, the game is just not as exciting as I would have hoped.  There&#039;s something here somewhere, and perhaps it should be just a two-player game -- but with four players it was just too chaotic and restricted.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Hahah, well -- I&#039;m not sure how much of a game this is.  Whoever wins or loses doesn&#039;t seem to be that important or rely on much skill.  It&#039;s a storytelling game and the fun part is whatever happens during the game.  At the end, it was fun going over what happened to each of us -- myself, a battle in the magical beast wars, and my son married to the sexy daughter of a beautiful princess.  I can&#039;t imagine playing it more than a few times, however -- it is fun for the occasional entertainment.</comment>				</item>

For a thematic adventure feel, I&#039;d much rather sit down to Runebound knowing that there is indeed an end in sight and I can do at least a little to control it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Pretty good little abstract disguised in a great theme.  There&#039;s a fair bit of luck in turning over the tiles, but that also makes it very replayable.  It&#039;s also cool that you have to play both sides in a game.  While the luck can make some situations very frustrating, it&#039;s enjoyable enough for a quick two-player game.  Played online at Yucata.de.</comment>				</item>

But this game is just a blast to look at and play.  *Update* - after collecting dust for over a year, got to pull it out again and realized why I liked this game so much in the past.  Just an excellent, fast-playing tile-laying game with a lot of choices and fun.  Absolutely gorgeous.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Uh oh - I didn&#039;t have high expectations going in, but yikes.  It&#039;s just way too mathy, it certainly is not elegant by any stretch of the imagination.  I&#039;m not sure why this is so popular -- I had a really hard time even desiring to finish my first play.  If I ever play it again we&#039;ll see if something went wrong, but I was playing with experienced players and I just didn&#039;t see where the fun was.  *UPDATE*  Played two-player with my son and we thought it was a lot better than the last time.  With the starting setup of monsters and items things flowed a lot better.  I have no idea if they had some expansion thrown into the other game but this was a lot more varied and interesting.  We got through the game fine but it was a bit long.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>What a great start to the map expansion series.  Both maps are terrific and very different.  The Legendary map introduces a new strategy, destroying trains, and it&#039;s a welcome addition to the family.  The map is tightly designed and plays well.  The team map, showing predominantly China, is a HUGE winner!  So far with my plays with four people the game is very tense and exhilarating.  The trick is that some of the information is shared, but not all, so it really makes you think how you want to move and plan.  I didn&#039;t think the map would play very tight either, but we found ourselves fighting over several spots with no stations to share them.  Great expansion!  Thanks Jasmine for the Christmas present!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Tikal is a beautiful game and it is also quite thematic, which gives it a big thumb in my book.  Fortunately, the fine folk that introduced me to it were not big into analysis paralysis, because this must be the game that spawned the concept.  I actually do like the mechanics of it, but what would inspire a designer to give each player ten actions a turn?!  Can&#039;t wait to play again.</comment>				</item>

But the game is absolutely gorgeous, and there&#039;s some clever deduction mechanics here.  Definitely would like to try again.  *Update* - better with four playres.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s got the action points going and there&#039;s no conflict at all, but there&#039;s still creative ways to have fun and score points.  Board looks beautiful afterward as well.  I have enjoyed the plays but not enough to feel the need to keep it around.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The experience is okay.  I think that the co-op game is much better than the competitive game (and makes more thematic sense).  But what it comes down to is that there isn&#039;t many decisions to make, and the big decision of the game (when to fight the bad guy) can be reached in awkward or strange conditions.  Most of the game consists of rolling a die, pulling a card, rolling a die, pulling a card, and it gets a bit monotonous even with the theme there.  I DO really like the mechanic with the town elders being friend or foe and having to peek at that information.  I just wish the game was more streamlined overall.</comment>				</item>

The blind selection part gave me pause, but it worked out better than I thought it would.  The theme is just pasted on, but at least you could try to think you&#039;re building things.  Anyway, the area majority saved it for me, and it&#039;s something I&#039;d like to play again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>One of the things I like about Feld is that he puts a lot of different ideas in a game and gives you lots of different ways to win.  Trajan is a good game, but I feel like it might be a little *too* convoluted with ideas and mechanics.  I think I prefer his &quot;simpler&quot; designs, like Luna or Castles of Burgundy, although I enjoyed my play of Trajan.</comment>				</item>

But it does a great job simulating the cold war and influencing areas.  A bit too heavy for my taste, though.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Pretty good family strategy game with a very nice production.  It was an enjoyable experience and I&#039;d like to have a copy sometime.  *Update* - have since acquired a copy and after a few plays, there&#039;s just not as much fun here as I originally thought.  What&#039;s worse is the kids aren&#039;t enjoying it -- perhaps too abstract for them?

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Well, it&#039;s Monopoly.  But I will say that this version did a good job in making it different, and taking care of two problems I had with the game:  player elimination and length.  Once a player is eliminated the game ends, and if you make a short track the game won&#039;t last more than an hour.  Still, it&#039;s Monopoly.  Not sure what to say.  It wasn&#039;t bad!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I had high hopes for this one.  Unfortunately the game sputters because of the different words and phrases that need to be learned and said quickly.  If these words were easy to remember it would be one thing, but you have to quickly check between the helper card and the situation in order to say the right thing, and then the builder has to check and figure it out.  It would seem to be a lot better just grunting.  I had high hopes!</comment>				</item>

Needs some major tweaking as there just weren&#039;t many decisions in it at all.  2) B-57 Cooperative Realtime Game -- a fast, realtime card game where you have forward and rear gunners playing cards to take out planes.  Creative ideas and it reminded me a bit of Wok Star.  Perhaps a bit monotonous but it&#039;s so quick that wouldn&#039;t matter.  </comment>				</item>

And I&#039;m going to black marker the numbers on there to get rid of the stickers. *Update* - Unfortunately, the game felt a little stale in future plays.  I liked it to begin with, though, and will retain my 7.5 rating.  I would play it again, but I don&#039;t feel like owning it anymore.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>For a deck of cards and 10 minutes, this is a neat little blend of a game.  I like the mechanic that encourages you to lose auctions in order to build population.  I would love to see that incorporated in a bigger game.</comment>				</item>

At four players it gets to be a bit difficult to strategize when it comes back around to your turn.  But the mechanics are fun and easy to understand and teach.</comment>				</item>

Forget the rules of the game and just have fun shooting the targets.  I will say that the game is made quite well, the use of the rubber bands is genius and creates a really fun experience.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>There&#039;s big-time scoring differences here between China and Web of Power, and I *think* I like China better. Other than the scoring, the games are almost identical in my mind.  I do like the &#039;look&#039; of China better, so it gets the better score.

*Update* - definitely like China better.  I prefer the one-time scoring instead of Web&#039;s 2x, it&#039;s nice to have three cards out to see.  And I like the map better, too.  It just seems to play smoother.  Clear winner.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I actually prefer this scoring system to the regular edition.  In the original, it just seemed like people would hold onto their money until the 6th round, and then if they were clearly behind, blow it all and then who knows.  The only negative with this game is that it is limited to five guessers, and that there aren&#039;t hardly enough questions.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I went in with zero expectations and came out quite impressed!  The components are stellar but its the gameplay that I was worried about -- and it really shines.  It&#039;s a race game with a lot of fun thrown in along the way.  If there was some way to eliminate player elimination (I really dislike that mechanic) it would be a purchase.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A quick, leader-bashing win the world game.  Some neat ideas as far as having leaders from all time-periods and having them run roughshod over the globe.  It was designed to be quick and fast-paced and it is, and it is fun, but I wish that you could use the ruler&#039;s powers just a bit longer before you had to discard him.  Definitely would enjoy another play.</comment>				</item>

I don&#039;t like ending a game when I feel like I&#039;m in the middle of it.  And while I&#039;m bitching, the board is way too busy and hard to locate places.  Unless you&#039;re a diehard fan of the online game, buy Runebound.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I want to like this game a lot -- the card mechanism is really ingenious, and I love how it drives the game.  There were just a few times during the game that I planned for things to happen and they didn&#039;t happen.  That led to a few turns that I couldn&#039;t do anything.  Perhaps I just have to go into it thinking that they might not, and then I won&#039;t feel so disappointed.  Even so, all the scores were close and it was a beautiful presentation.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;d love to try a three or four-player variant before making a final decision on this.  In the two-player game, it was fast and fun, but I&#039;m not sure there&#039;s much replay value here.</comment>				</item>

It&#039;s mental, and it&#039;s spacial, but I&#039;m not going to be attracted to it any time soon.  Still, if you love it and love these types of games, more power to you.  It&#039;s quality.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>Uh-oh!  After 9 plays it&#039;s waning a bit for me.  Still a solid 8 on the scale, and I still enjoy it, but it just seems a little repetitious at times.  I never expect it to leave the collection, though.  It&#039;s a wonderful-looking game with a lot of appeal to families.  UPDATE: I played once with two of the expansions and that helped liven it up a bit, so that&#039;s good news.</comment>				</item>
