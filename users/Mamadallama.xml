	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>6-17-13--got pushed to the back of the shelf by games that grabbed us from the start so we got this out today to see if we&#039;d missed anything.  pleasantly surprised, we had a lot of fun.  will have to explore more, not sure of replayability.  definitely would be a good game to pull out now and then if not exactly addictive.  increased rating from 7-8.

3-12--just to say we were playing it wrong...supposed to only start at top city and end in bottom one which irons out the problems we had.

2=28-13-first play, fun but much harder than it looks.  hard to remember which city you started on after you&#039;ve gone up and down the board a couple of times.
1-26-13-It&#039;s here!  watched video, looks easy to learn and fun.

	<numplays>16</numplays>			<comment>1-25-14-took awhile but i finally came to realize that we do not enjoy static games so much.  if there&#039;s no tactical side to the game it doesn&#039;t have that fun factor for us.  Even the introduction of the expansion has not infused anything of interest so it will hopefully go to a home where it is appreciated.  

9-16-12-This is one of those games that is simple to learn, easy to play, with multiple choices--but you can never do everything you want to do!  Fun, quick, interesting.

7-28-12-Played first game w/Miles.  Think we got the rules ok but now we have to figure out strategies!

7-27-12-It has arrived!  Did a quick solo play, interesting!

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>10-28-12-hadn&#039;t played this in 10 months! David (pfctsqr) inquired about the game which is why we played tonight.  much more fun as 2p than 3p for us, since 3p games always end up with Casey and Miles battling for Air Abacus and I diversify and win.  We&#039;ll be getting this out more often as 2p.  Think it got swept aside due to the &#039;cult of the new&#039;.  

12-22-11-We will never tire of this game.  It&#039;s too much fun!

12-9-11-3p game!  I managed to come in last but it was so much fun!  Casey loved it.  Of course, he won.  

12-5-11-Awesome game!  Miles says it&#039;s the best one yet!  Too bad I spent so long thinking it was an airlines version of TtR and glad I finally realized it&#039;s an economic game.  Lots of fun, can&#039;t wait to play a 3p game w/Casey.

12-1-11-Played learning game just to first scoring round since I was having trouble wrapping my mind around the rules.  I know it&#039;s supposed to be simple...but it&#039;s also very different from others we&#039;ve played.  Anyway, Miles immediately stated that he thinks it&#039;s a &#039;winner&#039;!  So it is!  Can&#039;t wait till we have time for a full game.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>1-6-15--Played our first game tonight--I have no idea (since I didn&#039;t make any notes) why this game was on my radar but I am so glad that whatever piqued my interest was enough to put it on my wish list.  This is not the standard Kosmo 2p.  This is a very meaty, brainburner of a game.  We love it!

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>3-29-12-Finally played a 3p game but I was disappointed.  I was really thinking it would be more fun.  Possibly it&#039;s because we&#039;re not used to the cards yet (even the printed ones) but I dunno...

2-25-12-Much better game, less frustrating when using replacement cards!

2-24-12-Found images on BGG with the meaning added to the cards.  Printed those off and we&#039;ll use them instead until we&#039;re used to the cards/symbols.  Very grateful Eric Selander for sharing this. http://boardgamegeek.com/image/711781/alea-iacta-est

2-24-12-Tried to play this yesterday and then again today with Miles.  Very confusing, mostly the Senate cards.  It&#039;s difficult to find them on the reference sheet, and seems to be more trouble than it&#039;s worth.  Frustrating.

	<numplays>17</numplays>			<comment>9-19-12-finally played and wow!  we forgot how much fun it is.  played 2p and i came in last, what an embarrassment!  :)  we won&#039;t be neglecting this game any more...

9-16-12-still haven&#039;t bothered playing the expansions!  need to get this out again, been too long since we played it.  

Punched but still unplayed.
Finally played base game twice, 2 player, didn&#039;t mind Dirk at all!  Fun game, simple, satisfying somehow.
Now have 2 plays with 3 players and I actually won both of them!  Won&#039;t last long because Casey always surpasses me in strategy.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Just played a 2nd game--ooh this is way more fun than I expected.  It sure is fun trying to figure out the optimum time to score. I don&#039;t want to read any strategies because that will spoil all the fun. Did I say &#039;fun&#039; enough?    

Early days, since it&#039;s our first play (2p) BUT I have to say that this game is so DIFFERENT and loads of fun!  Miles also is intrigued which is a definite plus.  It&#039;s worker placement, though different than the usual and one of the better themed games I&#039;ve come across.  The 3D aspect coupled w/the tetris-shaped building pieces make for a visually interesting game.  We will have to play many more times to be able to understand how to best time using banners and evaluations to gain workers and gold but it will be fun figuring that out.  I love the components and even the flimsy player screens for hiding info from your opponents are nice with places to hang your banners on the front!

	<numplays>17</numplays>			<comment>1-16-12-Taught the game to Casey and he loved it even more than I thought he would.  He even asked to play it a second time!  And he smoked me both times.  Great great game!

1-4-12-Finally got our 1st game in!  Played to first scoring so we could understand what we were trying to do, then started over and played a full game.  This is quite abstract and seemed confusing to me when reading the rules, but it came together really fast once we tried it out.  Miles and I see much potential and think we&#039;re going to love figuring out the strategy.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Diabolical!
We always play (after one fiasco!) that there cannot be more than one less cube of a color (than it takes to win a trophy) out on the landings.  This mostly applies to grey cubes because if there are too many out at once you will not be able to resolve them and will be deadlocked.</comment>				</item>

Simple to learn and play but actually a bit of a brain burner trying to figure out how to get the jewels you need to purchase the cards in the bazaar.  Ingenious little game!

	<numplays>56</numplays>			<comment>9/18/11--Took this on the cruise and we played at LEAST 5 games a day.  It&#039;s so easy and so much fun.  The cards are showing wear, but it doesn&#039;t seem to impact play.  All 3 of us love love love this game!

FINALLY!  I have this game in my hot little hands!  And it IS different and it IS fun!  This is right up there with Jaipur, I think, though I&#039;ve only played 2 games so far.  It will be better in the long run considering that it plays up to 4 while Jaipur only plays 2.

I am looking forward to trying it 3p soon.  So much game packed into such a short time, maybe 35 minutes after the first couple of games.  

1-8-14-first game.  a bit confusing, will take a few plays to get a handle on how strategy.  

12-14-13-couldn&#039;t resist all the good comments i keep seeing in the W&amp;G Forum.  </comment>				</item>

Played a couple of times today and maybe it&#039;s just because it&#039;s new to us, but it actually seems quite a bit thinkier than Splendor.  Fun and quick.  Perfect for work nights.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Oddville and Splendor-like</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>7-6-11-Just played this with Casey and reread the rules for clarification on a few points--obviously we had been playing wrong on a couple of points, so future games should play better and we will actually be able to complete (and know that we have!) a meadow.  Duh!
Yes, this game is great, I should always remember to periodically check to make sure we are playing correctly after a few games.  

We still don&#039;t have a handle on this gateway game.  I never can figure out how to get a meadow and the one time Miles did he only managed to get 4 points out of it!  We&#039;ll keep trying though. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>2-2-12-Received today and the rule set is so simple we were playing it almost instantly.  I love games like this that are designed so elegantly and so well.  2p game, me and Miles and he was able to pull off the win.  We both liked it a lot and I can tell it will be hitting the table very often.  We will likely continue to play the version w/hidden info rather than all cards face up since we like some luck in our games.

1-23-13-A game that lives up to the hype!  What?  Yes it does!  We love this game and already it is playing a bit faster.  Probably just over an hour and it&#039;s so engrossing.  Just like Macao that way.  Feld is magic!  I had already bumped it up to a 10, it&#039;s just so much fun.  Played tonight with variable player boards for the first time.  

1-15-13-ha!  finally played it and beginning confusion cleared up fast!  Really fun but rather long for us, about 1 hr 45 min for 2p game.  As we get familiar with tiles game will shorten but not sure by how much.  Still, just very fun--Feld is awesome!  Giving it a 9 since we won&#039;t play it as much due to game length.

9-19-12-arrived!

8-15-12-ordered, in stock, however w/pre-order of Seasons due in this month.  Love Feld.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>30</numplays>			<comment>1/13-14-rcvd this the other day and though it was sold as new it was obviously used. no shrink, card decks unwrapped and rubber banded, insert mangled and torn.  after a disappointing first inquiry to target language in which they insisted that the game was &#039;new&#039;, we did iron things out and i am keeping the game after a refund of $6.49.  

we played it twice and it is LOTS of fun.  while comparisons to Ticket to Ride and Finca may have merit, i think this one is just a bit more complex, and we really enjoyed it.  </comment>				<wishlistcomment>sounds like a fun pick up and deliver game</wishlistcomment></item>

We&#039;ve continued playing at home and while it&#039;s a simple push-your-luck-game, it&#039;s relaxing and fun.  We are finding it fun to play after our main game of the evening.

	<numplays>44</numplays>			<comment>8-11-12-Played with El Razul for first time.  Nice twists to jazz up the base game!

12-10-11-3p game just as fun!

11-27-11-I was on the fence forever on whether to buy this, worried that it would be too childlike, (how I feel about The Amazing Labyrinth) but played it for the first time tonight (2p) and was very pleased!  Very simple to learn, probably took about 20 min to play.  This is a huge plus w/my impatient guys.  Despite the simplicity of the rules and gameplay, there are some tough decisions to make over which fruit to collect and how to keep your opponent(s) in check.  I think it actually reminds me a bit of Thurn &amp; Taxis but it won&#039;t be as quiet as that one.  I predict this is going to be a favorite. Rating after 1 play =9.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>5-5-14-First game of Firenze today!  Actually it was quite fun (2p) and, as usual, I found out all kinds of things about the game that I really didn&#039;t understand from just playing on yucata.  It seems I am incapable of fully reading the rules on line.  Gah!  Anyway, a very &#039;take that&#039; aggressive type of game where you&#039;re meddling with your opponent(s) builds a whole lot.  Miles does not like to do &#039;mean&#039; things to me in games but has gradually come to understand that he is not really being mean to me when the game is structured that way and we play for fun with good attitudes.  So we did have fun with it, so much so that he asked to play it again tomorrow. :)

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>11-23-11-Played 1st game, 2p, and we both think we may like this better than Pandemic.  Although it is a bit lighter, it has a more interesting (to us) theme, is more aesthetically pleasing, and while still tense, is more fun. (We don&#039;t think Pandemic is &#039;fun&#039;.)  This is all from 1 play, however, so we will see how it goes.

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>5-2-12-Finally got our first 3p game in; definite winner for us since we like the puzzle aspect.  Plays quickly, too.  Maybe about half hour at most.

4-2-12-Just received after winning happycamper&#039;s auction.  Played our first game, 2p, and we enjoyed it.  Probably will get a lot of table time.  Pretty simple set collection game with interesting spatial aspect.  

Looks like a game we might enjoy...playing on yucata.de.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>11-19-14-Traded to Ozzy Perez.  Although I like Hawaii, it never quite did it for Miles so Notre Dame may be more our cup of tea.  

1-1-13-4th game, things are starting to gel!  quite a heavy game, i think more so than Macao.  we like it!

12-28-12-Finally tried this out.  I sure didn&#039;t understand the scoring in this game which is why I have been doing so poorly at it on Yucata.de!  Slow-going first game with Casey.  Set up is fiddly which we didn&#039;t like.  Played again but this time taught Miles on 29th--same slow playing.  We left it set up and will give another go tomorrow.  Much heavier game than I thought it would be but I do think we&#039;ll like it once we get the tiles down.

10-25-12-arrived today!

10-19-12-ordered from boardsandbits.com.  Yucata strikes again!</comment>				</item>

10-1-12-We got it!  First successful game, Miles won by 2 pts, we both enjoyed it!

9-14-12-Finally think we figured this out today.  We have been dunces, really misunderstanding the set up.

So simple, so elegant, so much fun!  This is the one that &#039;gets me&#039; every time I open the box--it&#039;s that beautiful.  It&#039;s in a tiny box with a perfect insert that holds all the beautiful components in a way that is very satisfying. And in the end, it&#039;s all about the camels! </comment>				</item>

3-7-12-Hadn&#039;t played this in quite some time--we really enjoyed it and didn&#039;t remember it as being such a brain burner, probably because we aren&#039;t familiar with the cards anymore.  

Lots of fun, relatively new to us.  Haven&#039;t tried it with the expansions yet.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>348</numplays>			<comment>4-26-14-Just a note to add that we play with all expansions in the mix from the time we received them.  There are a couple of things we leave out of Nomads; Miles does not like the tile that allows you to remove an opponent&#039;s settlement and also does not like the stones.  We love the way the expansions have kept the game fresh even after so many plays.  I would never choose to play without at least the Nomads exp.

7-29-12-To illustrate how much my husband (the non-gamer!) loves this game: he asked me today to order another copy because he&#039;s afraid we will wear out our current copy and then it will be out of print!  The only thing bad about this game is that I fear we will never get to play some of our other games that are still sitting in shrink!

3-8-12-We have played 41 games so far, in 3 weeks--we&#039;re obsessed!  Miles and I like to play 2p tournaments, best out of 3.  The more we play, the more we find there is to this one.  Sometimes you draw the objectives or the action tiles and you think, &quot;we just had those in the last game!&quot; but we&#039;ve found that games are radically different from just one rotated player board or 1 card or tile.  We&#039;ve also found that games are no longer 2p solitaire!  We are quite aggressive in our play and cut each other off when it suits us.  

2-23-12-We&#039;ve found the games goes on too long (for us) if there are more than 2 special action tiles (of the 4 used for each game) which require players to move pieces from the board rather than from their supply. 2p games go about 15-20 min. and 3p not much more; maybe 5 min.   

I find it easier to get a truly random setup by shuffling the special action tiles face down on the table and picking 4, then finding the corresponding game board sections, shuffle them on the table and put them together randomly without rotating them again after the shuffle is done.

Sometimes, depending on the objective cards drawn, this game plays as multiplayer solitaire and other times we very much get in each other&#039;s way, cutting each other off from large areas of the board.  That even happens in 2p games!  I like both ways AND I find it lots of fun seeing what kind of game is going to result from each random setup.    

2-17-12-Right now I am obsessed with this game so I am making the guys play with it as often as possible.  So far we have 7 plays, either 2 or 3p.  I&#039;m getting the hang of it a little better and am able to be more competitive.  It&#039;s great fun and the guys like it, too.  

2-12-12-Only played a couple of times but we are liking it.  It&#039;s not quite easy as some people are making it out to be.  Each decision is quite important even though the rules are simple.  I like the way that different objectives are used for each game and also boards.  All the variety should make this a highly replayable game.  It also plays fast which is always a good thing at our house.  I do see that this might be more fun w/4 players since then you would get in each other&#039;s way more, influencing your decisions more directly.

Made the game fresh and new, very exciting!  It was just Miles and I so can&#039;t wait to play it w/Casey.  Will record all plays w/main game, and that is game # 103.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Took this with us on our cruise and got in 2 three player games.  First one was a learning experience, 2nd one went much better and was lots of fun.  We kept score with pen &amp; paper rather than using the paper money.  Not very thematic, but much easier and since one of us is extremely impatient, it might be our preferred method of scoring even at home.  </comment>				</item>

(3p)
8-2-12-can&#039;t believe it&#039;s taken me this long to get this game to the table!  Took us 90 minutes to play this game but that includes punching and reading the rules.  (2p)  We enjoyed this a lot, too.  First impressions is that it is a mix of Stone Age and Macao.  (worker placement like SA, activating quests like you activate the cards in M.)

4-17-12-Couldn&#039;t help myself. Awesome price on Amazon, bought it!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Interesting sounding worker placement game stressing resource management.  Described by Castelli as simple and even a good introductory/gateway game.  Fun w/2 but different and more fun with 3 or more.  </wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>One of the first games I got from reading the geek.  Good choice for us.  We played the heck out of it until we started adding so many other new games to our library.  We go back to it often when we need a short, light game.  There are lots of criticisms about this one but it fills a niche for us.  

Seems like a lot of people don&#039;t get the scoring on this but I&#039;m not sure why.  Seems simple to us but maybe they just need to play with someone who &#039;gets&#039; it.  That&#039;s how I feel about Court of the Medici.  I would love to play that with someone who &#039;gets&#039; it since we sure don&#039;t!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>4-20-13-after going thru a few hands with Miles  the other day, i brought it out when visiting him today and this time we were so successful that he wanted to play a 2nd game of it as soon as we were done with the first.  it really is lots of fun.  this game reminds me of Citadels, but so streamlined and fun, without the boring or complicated bits.  :)

4-18-13-tried to play this with Casey and Miles the other day and gah!  they were not receptive and wouldn&#039;t listen at all.  so put it away until today and Miles and I played a few rounds.  i think it&#039;s fun and cute and fast, unsure what Miles thinks of it, but it&#039;s so quick i&#039;m sure i&#039;ll be able to get him to play again soon.

	<numplays>43</numplays>			<comment>3-17-12-Played the best game ever tonight!  3p scores 75,74, 71 (me in the middle).  Very intense!  Didn&#039;t know who won till the very last second!

10-29-11-Omigosh how we love this one!  It&#039;s just plain old fun, trying to figure out what cubes you&#039;re going to need, turning the windrose, picking out the cards, buying the sections of town, delivering goods on your cute little ship...and the best part is that no one can be sure who&#039;s winning until scoring is done at the end!  Very easy to learn, gameplay makes sense.</comment>				</item>

Playing on yucata and i do love it!

Different kind of tile-laying game.  Most say good as 2p but may be better w/more.  I like the sound of it. </comment>				</item>

4-26-12--Discovered this game on Yucata.de (great on line turn-based gaming site) and liked it immediately.  First f2f play today w/Miles and I can see it&#039;s a winner.  It&#039;s a little fiddly with the pieces sliding a bit on the board, but simple and fun.  Iconography on the cards is very easy to interpret.  We liked it!

	<numplays>17</numplays>			<comment>9-5-14-Definitely  favorite game.  Today&#039;s game was over in 40 minutes.  And that was with both of having a little AP at the end!  

5-18-14-Played once, loved it and immediately set it up to play again.  We loved the 2nd play, too, and this is really saying something from a guy who prefers game length of 30-45 min.  I was amazed at Miles&#039; reaction!  It took us ~1 hr 45 minutes for each game.  I know it&#039;s early days but I&#039;m starting this one out as a 10.  :)

5-17-14-Got this out today and set it up, then watched Rahdo&#039;s runthrough again.  We will be ready to play tomorrow!  Can hardly wait; looks like it&#039;s right in the sweet spot for us. :)

4-24-14-Auction-Steven Zamborsky, arrived in great shape.

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>11-30-11-Every time I play this I love it even more.  Someone commented (on BGG) that this is chess-like.  Though true, if I had realized it before buying I never would have even considered it and would have been deprived of a wonderful game.  Love love love it!
11-14-11-Took this on a cruise and got in our first 3p game.  Just as much fun!  Increase from 9-10 rating.

10-30-11-Just got in our first play (2p) and both Miles and I loved it!  He really ran away with it though.  I&#039;m never the fastest learner.  I am just beginning to realize how much we enjoy area control.  Very simple game play, with each decision being interesting and important.  I&#039;ll probably dream about it tonight...

I can see this (and For Sale) are going to have to go with us up to visit family.  They&#039;ll all love these quick and simple games.  You try to get the lowest score by taking cards with the least points.  If you 2 or more in succession you only count the lowest card of the run.

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>11-26-14--Miles and I loved our first play so much that we added in The New Persons Exp and played it again right away.  

11-19-14-Traded Hawaii for Notre Dame with Ozzy Perez. </comment>				<wishlistcomment>quote from David Brant who recommended this game to me:
It is a bit lighter and faster than Macao. The board is modular and sets up a bit differently as to the number of players. It scales from 2 to 5 really well. It has a simple card drafting mechanic that determines the actions that are available each turn and has an interesting worker placement mechanic that is a bit unique. Its easy to set up and explain. Very addictive game

Now I have watched Richard Ham&#039;s video I must have it!</wishlistcomment></item>

3-19-12-First play f2f, with Miles!  I think this is going to be as addictive as Kingdom Builder!  I have played one other game of it on Yucata.  Really looking forward to getting familiar with it.  Starting it off w/an 8.

3-14-12-Couldn&#039;t wait...got it today!  I have punched and looked it over but didn&#039;t get to spend too much time with it yet.  Been trying to figure it out on Yucate.de but I do better figuring out new games when I have it physically in front of me.

3-11-12-Kim (callie) is obsessed with this one so I&#039;m thinking I need to check it out!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>This is the right combination for us.  Simple rules but need to make good choice, short playing time.  Love it!

I have heard this compared to Alhambra but it&#039;s really not like it beyond the building thing.  I think there&#039;s lots more to it and we all like it better.  Alhambra hasn&#039;t made it to the table since we got this, in fact.  

Played our first game (2p) and we really liked it.  Need to go over the rules to make sure we got them all right.  Will wait for a few more plays to rate it.

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>12-28-11-Our first 3p game, Miles didn&#039;t know what he was doing and won, of course!  Scales just as well as they say, but this really is an awesome 2p game.

12-24-11-Played 2 more games w/Casey today and lost both miserably!  That said, I find this game more and more fascinating w/each play!  I am boosting rating 8 to 10!

12-21-11-Hopefully we now understand the rules re: polishing.  You may only polish (up to 3) when first exhibiting, except in the last round where you may polish all you want but again, this applies only to new exhibits.  

12-18-11-Played two 2p games w/Casey.  Lots of fun!  Interesting how the auction mechanism works, I get frantic thinking I am way behind and though I did lose both games, both times were only by 4 or 5 pts.  

12-12-11-Got this out for a dry run--quite interesting and I can&#039;t wait to play it for real!

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>9-19-12-just got this out tonight after a very long hiatus...it was really good. 

What fun this is!  And it&#039;s so fast!  We are not as fond of this one as a 2 player game but it&#039;s great with 3.  When I first opened this and punched it, I thought it looked far more complicated than it sounded from reading about it.  But, thankfully, it&#039;s not and it&#039;s just as much fun as everyone said it is.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>95</numplays>			<comment>11-26-12-haven&#039;t played this as much lately (cult of the new plus obsession with Kingdom Builder!) but it really is a fun game and glad we got it out today.  won&#039;t let it go so long again without playing!

12-31-11-This is absolutely our favorite game.  No one EVER says no to another game of Ra Dice.  The more we play, the better we get and the tighter our scores.  Many dismiss this as a dice fest and Yahtzee cone, but once you&#039;re familiar with the scoring, you can usually play it much more smartly than would seem at first glance.   

Played 3 times today, once 3p, and twice 2p.  I&#039;m pretty sure this is going to be a favorite!  At first it seemed confusing, but then it came together very quickly.  Still couldn&#039;t seem to pull off a clean win though.  Tied for 1st once (3p) and lost the other 2 games, the last one by one point!

Casey&#039;s favorite because it&#039;s fun and so quick.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>6-9-14-Played this after quite a long hiatus and discussed why this doesn&#039;t hit the table that often.  I think we like more tactical games and this is definitely squarely in the strategic camp.

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>1-22-15--We are so enjoying this game!  Always wanted to like Settlers of Catan, but never enjoyed the play.  Always seemed to drag and many times there was nothing you do because of the dice rolls.  With this game, those issues are fixed and it&#039;s very fun.  We played several times with the base game then several with the Era of Gold and today tried Era of Turmoil for the first time.  All are very fun!  Once we get familiar with Turmoil and the next included expansion we will play with all of three and see how that goes.  Then I have the other 2 separate expansions!  So I believe we will be entertained by this game for a long time!  The only caveat is that is 2p only.  It&#039;s a fairly long game (1 1/2 to 2 hrs) so I guess it&#039;s a blessing that it isn&#039;t intended for more players.  :)

10-14-14-ordered through Amazon.  2p game wanted for cruise.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>38</numplays>			<comment>Just rec&#039;d this today!  Played one 2 player game and one 3 player game.  All of us loved it!  I resisted this for a long time because when looking at the video reviews I just didn&#039;t see how it could be fun.  Glad I caved.  Looking forward to understanding more of the strategy.

The more I play the more I like it.  Miles&#039; favorite.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>41</numplays>			<comment>12-14-12-played again today, i dare to think we have found the game that might rival Kingdom Builder when it comes to obsession!  I wonder if it will have the replayability that KB has?  We&#039;ll find out.  Miles wanted to leave it out to play again tomorrow.  Am bumping this to a 10...

i love how easy this game is to set up, too.

12-13-12-played twice today! First game we just dithered around and halfway thru watched Cat and Mouse review which was very helpful (more helpful than when i had watched it earlier!).  Second game was a real game and we had a good time.  We do think we&#039;ll like this one.  Next game we will draft our hands using the first 30 cards rather than using the sets for new players.  Fun! :)

9-19-12-arrived!  Seeing many comments that this plays best with 2 and can really outstay its welcome with 4.  2p under 30 min, 3p-45 and 4p over an hour.

8-15-12-Pre-ordered, due in this month.  Looks mega-interesting.  Dice, cards, combos, gorgeous.  Plays well thru player count (2-4).  Player interaction. 4p game ~ 60 min.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>6-30-14-Played this a couple of weeks ago with 3p and it&#039;s much better, I think, than with 2p.  That market rondel is genius with the money tied into it.

6-22-14-Miles and I played this through this week, made some goofs and muddled our way, but still had fun.  I brushed up by re-watching Rahdo&#039;s run-through again and then broke it out for my game group today.  It was so much fun!  (Actually only 3 of us).  I am thinking this is going to be a new obsession...when you think of how little you do on a turn--essentially choosing one tile and placing it---wow! So much going on!  :)  It will be really quick for just me and Miles and even with my A/P prone game group, it won&#039;t be too bad.  Looking forward to really getting familiar with this game.

1-12-14-watched Rahdo&#039;s run-through and now it&#039;s mine.  Amazon.com.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Looks really interesting.  Fairly simple, strategy and tactics.  Joel Eddy says good for 2-4 and is a family game.  (windmills, reclaiming marshland)</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>4-29-14-This IS a fun game.  My game group loves it and it&#039;s even good with just the 2 of us (not an obsession though).  

3-29-14-played our first game (with the 9000 Exp), just Miles and I.  Started coming together by the time we finished the game but still unsure of how we feel about it.  Need to play more.  I think it&#039;s too AP prone for the game group, unfortunately.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>1-6-12-We&#039;re having a lot of fun with this, only play w/the green board with the hole in the middle and we get such a kick out of it when one of our opponent&#039;s pawns slides in!  The downside of this game is that it often results in ties, sometimes even 3 way ties!  We don&#039;t care though, it&#039;s the playing that&#039;s fun.

1-3-12-Surprise gift from Casey-he says it&#039;s my Christmas present!  I kept looking at this every time I was in a store, hoping to catch it on sale, so when he found a deal on Ebay, he snapped it up!  So we had to try it out and we had lots of fun with it.  So much so that we played 4 games in a row. (3p)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>2-17-14-played 3 games today.  it&#039;s really a fun solo game which is probably the only way i will get to play it which is fine with me.  anyone who likes klondike will like this game.  takes a bit to figure out how best to use the action cards.  different officer cards make each game play out differently. 10 rating for the solo game.  

2-14-14-arrived today--not too bad for coming all the way from the UK!

1-30-14-ordered from Cosmo Books from UK through Amazon.</comment>				<wishlistcomment>based on klondike mechanic.  solo play or can play cooperatively.  one of the few solo or coop games i think i might enjoy.  missed kickstarter.  </wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>7-13-13-Will always play w/Kaispeicher.  Taught to Casey and he loves this, too.  Seemed to move along much faster as a 3p game but maybe because our only other game (2p) was our first.

7-10-13-Finally got to play this along with exp Kaispeicher and it was loads of fun.  Exp is really nice and makes it worth keeping the base game for just 2p.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>9-20-15--Have only had time to play twice.  Both times everyone got a kick out of it but no one seemed as crazy about it as me.  Both groups I played it with (3 others + me each time) thought it was more of an activity than a game and no one liked keeping score.  We just laughed at each other&#039;s answers.  I think this is a problem I keep running into with word games anyway--even though in this one you don&#039;t have to be able to spell.  :(

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>12-22-11-We had to read the rules again since it had been so long since we&#039;d played.  Too many new games, I guess.  It was lots of fun and we won&#039;t let so long go by without playing it again!

10-29-11-This is another one that&#039;s just pure fun.  It&#039;s so great-looking and all the components are top notch.  It&#039;s also another one that you&#039;re often surprised to find out at the end who won.

I don&#039;t know why people fuss over the math here.  Simple arithmetic and you don&#039;t bother with it until you score at the end of the game.</comment>				</item>

Once you see the way it works, it&#039;s all downhill from there.  I would play again if someone really really wanted to, otherwise, not choosing it myself.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>1-29-13-Have had this game for several months, finally got it off the shelf!  Much simpler than most of the games we&#039;ve been getting into lately (besides the push-your-lucks), but still seemed fun from our first play.  Definitely going to have to give it some more table time to see if my initial rating of 7 is accurate.  We just played 2p and I can see that 3 or 4 would be even better.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>6-27-12-I hardly ever &#039;want&#039; to play this though would if someone else wanted to.  I love the look of it, but the play is dry as the desert it depicts.  Looks like my initial reservations were spot on.

2-19-12-First play, 2p, successful.  We thought it was fun and are looking forward to playing again and to introducing it to Miles.  

2-4-12-Ordered from coolstuffinc.com
I had the wrong impression of this game and now see that it will be a perfect game for us.  I w a n t it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>Just received this from an auction.  Looking forward to first play.

9-24-11-Just played my 2nd 2 player game and we really like this one.  It&#039;s different in that while there&#039;s not a lot of interaction or direct conflict, we find that we are intensely interested in each other&#039;s moves.  Wonder if that will change as we get more used to the game.

Quiet game but involving.  Often compared to Ticket to Ride.  I don&#039;t get the same feel from it though.  We really like it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Second play was better.  Sub&#039;d dice for all token stacks except 2&#039;s and 7 so it was less fiddly.  Very crowded board, even for just 3 players--big change over USA board!   

We just got this and have only played once.  It seemed to take FOREVER!  We found the little tokens fiddly--always falling over and Miles couldn&#039;t even get his fingers in there to pick them up.  Plus we were such idiots we couldn&#039;t find the cities, couldn&#039;t figure out the cards, just whined and whined!  Wah wah baby carrots! I did read a tip to replace the tokens with dice and I bought the dice so when we have time this weekend we&#039;ll give it another chance.  But we were seriously disappointed in that first play.

	<numplays>16</numplays>			<comment>9-4-13-played our first game and it went quite well--just one minor rules correction to note with our next game.  quite simple (esp if you already play Dominion or other deckbuilders) and quite engaging.  the board really does add quite a lot to the experience.  

8-22-13-arrived from boardsandbits.com

8-6-13-Joel Eddy and Richard Hamm--it&#039;s all their fault that I preordered this one.  Not sure of the release date.

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>9-8-12-I think this game is an overlooked gem.  It&#039;s fun every single time, whether 2p or more.

6-5-12-We are going to start playing 2p tournaments like we do w/Kingdom Builder.  Miles won the first game of this best 2 out of 3 today.  We really like this game and it&#039;s nice and quick and fun!  Set collection w/a twist and a cute theme.

5-19-12-Way more fun that I expected!

5-6-12-Finally got this to the table!  3p game.  For what is described as a very simple game, it did not go smoothly but I think all will be well on the next play.  I believe this is going to be a fun set collection game.

	<numplays>68</numplays>			<comment>3-14-13-this one just gets better and better!  it&#039;s so much fun.  have only played 2p, wondering how it will go with 3...one of our very best and most fun to play games.

3-5-13-Just played our 3rd game and this one is definitely more and more fun as we get familiar with it.  Really enjoyed tonight&#039;s game despite Miles winning by a landslide.  I may have been wrong--this might be already becoming an obsession....

2-18-13-First play today!  These are the most poorly written rules for a game which I believe is essentially pretty simple!  Very very annoying!  Even the FAQ is put together poorly and not all questions seem to be answered.  We had a couple of false starts but I think we have it now.  I don&#039;t know yet if it will ever be an obsession (KB and CoB!) but I do think we will like it.

7-27-12-arrived!

5-27-12-ordered from boards&amp;bits.

1-25-12-Most game played w/simultaneous action so should appeal to my guys.  Looks like it might be fun.  Part puzzle, part euro.  **THERE IS FAQ from designers in Forums.**</comment>	<conditiontext>VLD from boards&amp;bits.com</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>12-12-11-more is revealed w/every play!  I&#039;ve got a feeling this is going to be a 10!
12-11-11-Played 1st 3p game (Casey), really great.  We have not explored caravan play yet.  love how fast this plays and the cool use of the dice...

11-29-11-FINALLY got to play this one w/Miles for our first game.  Watched Board Games w/Scott video first, very helpful.  A bit of stumbling but played pretty well for first time and we liked it a lot.  Both of us looking forward to discovering more as we log more plays.  Really glad I chose this one.  (played w/variant: only 8 white dice, each round first player gets 2 moves, building is not option, instead it&#039;s a 4th action.) Played 2nd game next day, even more fun!
