	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>7 Wonders is a draft game, and one I would tell people to avoid at all costs. 

The theme is pasted on, there is no grand civilization feel to the game. The only interaction is with the people sitting next to you and it&#039;s minimal at that.

If you&#039;re unlucky enough to be sitting downstream to a person who knows what they&#039;re doing then you&#039;re going to be in for a rough time. You&#039;ll lament your position while you watch other people on the opposite side of the table scoring tons of points because they&#039;re positioned between people who are less experienced.

Do not believe any argument about having influence on people more than 2 spaces away from you, it&#039;s simply not true. You can table talk all you want, but at the end of the day, everyone is at the mercy of the people who are passing to them.

If you&#039;re looking for a game that lets you play 7 players, then I&#039;d suggest Resistance. If you&#039;re after a draft game, then just play Magic the Gathering. Build a cube (which is just an assortment of cards) and draft that with some friends. 7 Wonders isn&#039;t worth your time.

I&#039;ve been told that this is best with 3, but it&#039;s highly unlikely that I&#039;ll ever revisit this. It&#039;s also important to note that my disdain with this game comes from the group I was playing it with. On my right, I had my mate who&#039;s a drafting shark, and on my left, a beginner who couldn&#039;t stop complaining as I was drafting &quot;too fast&quot;. I thought fast play was a good thing, apparently not according to some people. All the while, people sitting at the opposite side of the table were just handing the win to someone else.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I want to play this more, and I want to play this well. The feeling is fantastic as you fight yourself out of the mire of debt.

One of the most disappointing things about this game are the components. The third edition has terrible plastic trains which I replaced with wooden pieces similar to the ones found in 2nd edition. The wooden cubes for goods come in terrible colours (and by terrible I mean, distinguishing between blue and purple is a nightmare) which I&#039;ve also replaced. And not to mention the awful paper money which I&#039;ve replaced with a poker chip set. 

If I didn&#039;t love this game so much, I wouldn&#039;t have gone to all the trouble!

I guess they cheaped out instead of actually making this game properly.

Half baked, half produced; avoid.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>I played the family version of this game 7 times before I moved onto Farmers of the Moor. I still haven&#039;t touched the occupations yet! 

This game is fantastic! It is definitely punishing when you first start playing. Once you&#039;re familiar with the tempo of the game, it has a wonderful puzzle like feature in trying to squeeze the most out of your limited actions.

I don&#039;t mind at all that the game seems to end just as you get your engine started, it just spurs me on to complete my engine before the final round!

My only regret with regards to this game is that I wish I didn&#039;t wait so long to try this game out. I didn&#039;t believe the hype, but boy oh boy, was I wrong. 

I don&#039;t think I could play another family game with just the base game. It&#039;s still Agricola but far and away a shadow of the great game it is.

Update: I&#039;ve been wondering if without the expansion, this game isn&#039;t very good. The constant rush for wood and family growth are issues, and the fact that more workers equal more actions and even more points compounds the snowball effect. Without expansions, 3 player is a lot better than 4 player, though less tight. With 4, initial starting position is huge and the food difference is too small to mitigate.

I always play with the variant where the player who is coming second in turn order isn&#039;t allowed to take starting player. This variant removes the bickering over turn order between two players and prevents the person who had previously claimed first player to then suddenly find themselves in last position. Admittedly this is an issue in the 4+ player game but I&#039;ve kept it when playing 3 player as well.

Expansions:
Farmers of the Moor
Gamer&#039;s Deck
World Championship Deck

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This really needs the expansions to be interesting. Otherwise it&#039;s a light and quick worker placement game. It&#039;s a perfect introduction to players who are new to the hobby. :)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This was really fun when it came out. Exploring it was great and it was quite the adventure. After a bad experience with the local community around here, I ended up falling out of the scene.

I did end up trying some new decks after a few more data packs came out. I didn&#039;t realise Netrunner had changed so much! It felt like a completely different beast and not for the better.

This game highlighted a serious flaw of the LCG model. While it&#039;s definitely nice to be able to get access to all the cards without having to chase cards on the secondary market, the fact that the packs simply do not add enough cards to influence the metagame is a serious flaw. 

Not only this, but without rotation, the metagame ends up getting stale without substantial deck innovation. I&#039;m not sure how Netrunner ended up the way it is now, but it was definitely way more enjoyable when it first came out. It&#039;s now become a combo heavy field, with no end in sight.

Update 6/11/14: Looks like I called it? FFG just announced a rotation policy for their LCGs. I wonder if there will be any backlash considering the fact you now have to constantly buy cards like a CCG. After finding out about the details, the rotation policy seems half baked. Not too sure why the big boxes don&#039;t rotate too, nor why the rotation is so far apart. This is still going to have all the issues I raised, and with every additional big box addition, it&#039;s just going to add to the bloat.

Update 9/11/14: Looks like the backlash is here.

Update 8/07/15: I&#039;m never going to play this game ever again, so the updated rating reflects that. The fact that rotation is so slow and that the number of cards added has either too much impact or no impact at all is a downside in my eyes. The cost is a huge issue too, irrespective of the LCG model.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>01/11/14 - Upgraded from a 7 to 8. This is definitely an 8.
06/05/15 - Down to 7. Haven&#039;t played this one in a while.
26/09/15 - Back up to 8. 

This game has spawned so many derivatives. It&#039;s the original and still the king.

Even without the additional cards, it&#039;s still absolutely fantastic.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>BattleCON is one of the best games I&#039;ve ever played. A fighting game in a box; it&#039;s quick and it&#039;s addictive. I know that if this game had come out in my younger years I would have played this non-stop. While I may not have as much free time now, it&#039;s still a fantastic pick up and play game. The amount of content in the box is fantastic!

I&#039;d just like to give a shout out to Level 99 Games. Excellent customer service and keep up the good work!

Update: Dropped the rating from a 9 to an 8. It&#039;s really AP inducing, so disregard my comment about quick.

I wonder if the layout of the cards could be better. Maybe with some large numbers so that you don&#039;t need to memorise what order everything needs to be in.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;m really looking forward to playing this more, especially since it&#039;s not particularly long and it&#039;s temporary alliances crammed into a box.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;ve played it 2 player a few times including both controlling only one country and controlling two countries at a time. 2 countries at a time is quite interesting!

Great gateway game with a bit more tactical bite once you have a feel for the tile distribution. Really enjoyable with 2 and works as a light gateway game for larger groups.

Farmer scoring is mildly tricky but they iron out after the first game.</comment>				</item>

Will either move up to 8 or down to 7.

04/05/15: This ultimately sank and I traded it on. 

I think I liked this game more than the people I ended up playing this with. It&#039;s a classic, but I have way more enjoyment playing Dominant Species. I wish the favor tracks could be modified in some way, or there were alternate tracks.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>There&#039;s nothing wrong with this game, but I find this experience extremely exhausting. The way I went about this game was treating it as a giant math trade. If anyone wanted any of the tiles that I had, I got them to trade for the tiles I wanted from other people. Never deal with people directly for the stuff you want. I won the game by a significant margin as well; make sure you hold onto your cash!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This game seemingly revolves around the gain 3 coins ability.

When the player&#039;s realise that, it&#039;s not exactly all that fun. Calling out a player who&#039;s lying at the beginning is fraught with danger and games where everyone is gaining 3 coins is stupid.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This rating is based on the co-op module released as a game night kit from Fantasy Flight. The co-op is spectacular and a lot of fun. I was a bit worried about my purchase of Descent after playing the first question in the campaign but the co-op has wiped those worries away. It&#039;s tense and there&#039;s a ton of dice rolling and some decision making along the way. 

If you&#039;re looking for a dungeon crawl, Descent 2 with the co-op module is where it&#039;s at!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>I ignored all the warnings from people who said this game was heavy and boy did I pay for it. The experience was utterly amazing but left me with a headache afterwards. 

It probably doesn&#039;t help when you&#039;ve been doing a ton of math to then follow it up with a game of this caliber but not to worry, I&#039;ll do better next time. 

This is a great game though, don&#039;t let my comments dissuade you, you need to play this! And I can&#039;t wait to get this back to the table.

Updated comment: Looking back, this game isn&#039;t that particularly heavy. The first play is definitely overwhelming, but each subsequent play becomes far simpler and easier. People have called this a war game disguised in Euro clothing and that&#039;s definitely the case. Playing face-to-face is the best way to play even though I quite enjoy the IOS app. 

This game ended up firing Caylus for me. The play is just a lot more tense. 

9/5/15 - Updated rating from a 8 to a 9.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>65</numplays>			<comment>Star Realms fired this game for me. 

The beginning setup and the ending count of VPs all take a little too long for me to really enjoy this. 

Star Realms has none of that, and it&#039;s just a lot faster to start and play again. I give this game props for taking the combo elements in Magic the Gathering and turning it into a game. Mind you, the amount that this takes from Magic is not minor.

It still is better than the vast majority of deck builders out there, but I&#039;ve had my fill and moved on. It&#039;s important to note that I&#039;m talking about the base game only. I&#039;ve never played with the expansion cards so can&#039;t say whether the experience improves or not with the expansions. I&#039;m assuming it does.

Update 01/03/15 - Updated from a 3 to a 4 and then back down to a 3 again. I&#039;ve been playing the expansions online and it&#039;s been fun! The fact that the setup is done for you makes it even better. Unfortunately there&#039;s still issues.

- Warning: Minor strategy talk ahead - 





I find big money in the base game really boring. Base game dominion is probably a 2 or 3 for me if players just play big money strategies. If all players are running the big money strategy then we might as well flip a coin and call it right there and then.

After playing with the expansions, while big money is less prevalent, it&#039;s still a big enough part of the game that I&#039;m not fond of it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I entered into the world of Euphoria extremely excited. It has the most amazing components I have ever seen and with the promise (from others) of exquisite game play, the hype was there. I was ready. 

What I found was a serious mess. This is a race game where all the players are on unequal starting positions. This would be all fine and dandy if as a group we could collectively peg the leader back. Unfortunately, even though it&#039;s a &quot;worker&quot; placement game, there&#039;s no blocking in this game. Not only this, but if you roll doubles, then you get to take extra turns. If you roll extremely low, you&#039;re improving your chances as well. 

The game made so little thematic sense that when people talk about pasted on theme, I think of this game. Workers are shown by their intelligence, denoted by the pips on the die. I don&#039;t know how they don&#039;t get smarter the longer they experience the real world, nor do I understand why you have to re-roll their intelligence once you recall your workers.

I left Euphoria disappointed. Disappointed and unwilling to return.

Update: I read that the cards are getting a re-balance. Props to the designer on that, but it does make you wonder why this wasn&#039;t developed and tested properly in the first place.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m not fond of games like this anymore. I can definitely understand the appeal; the design is simple and straight to the point. 

It just feels like a giant puzzle where all the players are trying to solve it optimally. There&#039;s always a best move and the decision space is simply not one that interests me anymore. I don&#039;t really want to compete with people to work out where the highest amount of points can be found on a multicoloured smorgasbord.

The djinn cards are annoying in that the iconography isn&#039;t clear and having them written on the back of the player aid isn&#039;t great.

Maybe it&#039;s best with 2 where the downtime is less severe. Playing it with 4 was just not fun. By the last round I wasn&#039;t even paying attention to what my opponent&#039;s were doing.

All these annoyances just lead to such an uninspiring game. It works, there&#039;s nothing broken about it, but it left me with a feeling of emptiness. I just don&#039;t care for it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I was looking forward to this just from the general praise I had heard from friends and from boardgamegeek. 

Unfortunately I had picked the Lannisters without really understanding their predicament of being the &quot;worst&quot; faction to start off with. Before the game even started, one of the players harped on for about 5 minutes as to why my faction was the worst.

What proceeded was nothing short of bemusement. A few turns in, everyone realised I was about to win before even I knew I was about to win. I had stumbled my way into the headlights of all the other players. 

The players then planned to attack me on multiple fronts which was expected. What was not expected was an attack from a player who I believed could not reach me. I had misread the board state due to some devious placement of ships on the opposite side of the board. I was not impressed.

Board games to me are a competition in decision making. If I&#039;m stuck gaming with people who believe that you need to win at all costs then that&#039;s the day I quit this hobby for good. As to whether I&#039;ll play this game again? I doubt it. The map is busy, the components are clumsy (the armies defending territories are pretty big and obscure the board), the cards are numerous (so you need to learn all the cards before you can even successfully navigate the mire of combat) and the game play isn&#039;t that compelling. Why bother?

I realised from this experience that I really dislike heavy negotiation games. Watching players plead with each, make snide remarks or cajole weaker players into bad positions is not my idea of entertainment. It&#039;s like being around a whole bunch of marketers trying to sell you things that you&#039;re not interested in. That&#039;s pretty much my idea of hell.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Finally, someone designed a draft game correctly. 7 Wonders and Sushi Go both lack and are all style and no substance. Ginkgopolis on the other hand comes into the fold by adding both tableau building, resource collection and area control. 

You can choose to focus only on the board but the cards which help build your tableau make different actions more viable. 

I really enjoyed this one. This is viable alternative to drafting in Magic, which, before Ginkgopolis, was the only viable draft game. 

Our first game was sprawling in all directions and our second game was a straight up race for the skies. Played it exclusively with 2 and excited to play it with more.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>65</numplays>			<comment>Endless depth and one of the greatest games ever created. The simplicity of the rules makes this a marvel and a complete game. The scoring at the end is problematic, but at worse, you play it out till it&#039;s really obvious.

It&#039;s quite difficult to get to the table since you need a dedicated partner, and teaching people from the ground up isn&#039;t simple either. There&#039;s so much to teach and a lot is dependent on your own personal style and your ability to grasp the &quot;feel&quot; of the game. I&#039;m not good enough to be able to pinpoint exactly why something is a good move or not except through gut instinct. Mind you, the number of terrible moves I make far outweigh the number of good moves.

Tactics and strategy abound in this abstract, and it disappoints me when people say that they refuse to play this because it&#039;s not thematic enough; use your imagination!</comment>				</item>

Wow, what a game, I definitely need to play this more. I&#039;ve played this now with 3 and it&#039;s just as fantastic as with 2. I only wish there were more randomisation with the tech trees, but the auctions is where it&#039;s at. And the auctions are GLORIOUS!

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>My very first impression was this game is an 8/10. But after thinking about it and wanting to get it to the table as soon as possible, I&#039;m pretty sure this game is a 9/10. Fantastic game! I played terribly in my first game, but the second game will be different. :) 

Yes, this is a 9/10 game. Absolutely fantastic. There&#039;s some really clever board play and a lot to think about. 3 actions is all you need to win the game and lots of varied strategies.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Played this so horribly wrong the first time (we stuffed up the setup). Need to revisit!

All I can say is.. wow!

1/12/14 Dropped from a 9 to an 8. Haven&#039;t felt the desire to play this.

4/5/15 And from 8 to a 5. I don&#039;t have any desire to visit this again. I&#039;m not sure what it is, but it feels like I enjoy this a lot less than I&#039;m supposed to. There&#039;s nothing wrong with it, just lacks that spark. That thing that makes you excited and want to play it.</comment>				</item>

Great abstract game, nice and quick. It&#039;s got some really interesting dynamics and I&#039;m looking forward to exploring it a lot more. I don&#039;t know why, but I had trouble learning it on iOS and found it a lot easier to learn while playing with the pieces.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Second game, I won on the third turn! My cruisers flew through space, destroyed some other cruisers and did flybys slaying transports in their wake!

Excellent customer service from Asmadi games! Top notch.

29/08/14 - I&#039;m not sure what to make of this game. I don&#039;t think I understand this game. I need to play this more.

09/08/14 - I ended up trading this one away. Dropped my rating from a 7 to a 4. Noone I played this with really enjoyed it. The rulebook is really clunky and the wording on the cards is average at best. I quite liked the impulse track and the decisions around that. I didn&#039;t end up playing it enough to discover if there was an amazing game after the initial learning barrier. Oh well, I still have Innovation and Glory to Rome.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Indonesia is a sprawling economic game. It&#039;s as good as everyone says it is. The mergers are a wonderful innovation and is the thing that makes this game so special.

It doesn&#039;t have as much bite as other economic games and losing your companies doesn&#039;t hurt as much since you get paid out accordingly. Mind you, this just makes it a lot harder to work out when you&#039;re getting screwed and when you&#039;re not. It&#039;s subtle and it&#039;s amazing.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;ve gone from not understanding this game, to finally being to get a feel for what&#039;s going on. That&#039;s after 30 games. 

The first few ages are quite familiar, but the final ages are incredibly perplexing. The higher ages start snowballing to the endgame in an out of control fashion. Fantastic game!

Wow, I&#039;ve been getting lots of plays against the AI and finally beat the hardest level AI (100%). Won by trying to draw an age 11 card with 150 points in the bank to 0. Mind you, it&#039;s not all about the points!

Note: This game is not good multiplayer (3 or more people). You lose the ability to respond quickly enough to the changing landscape due to another person taking the potential cards that could help alter the course of the game. If you fall behind as well, you&#039;re really stuck. I also don&#039;t think the expansions are required at all. 90%+ of the games I&#039;ve played have been base game only and it still has legs.</comment>				</item>

I realise now that mentioning the two in the same sentence is just an insult to Blood Bowl. This game is garbage.

It was so incredibly clear that the factions were imbalanced that it turned into a game where people were ganging up on the Amazons.

The Amazons are ridiculous with their ability to attack along diagonals while every other team can only attack orthogonally. Why does this matter? Because your character stops whenever you&#039;re even walking past an Amazon character, and with their incredibly high attack skill, the chances of your character surviving are pitiful. So they gum up the ground, and when you try to take them on you end up losing. Does this sound remotely fair or balanced? Did people even playtest this game at all? 

Stuff like this make me angry. This is nothing but a giant shelf piece. It looks amazing on the shelf, but as soon as you actually try it, you&#039;re left with that empty feeling that you&#039;ve wasted not only your time but your money.

CMON are simply a miniatures company, nothing more, nothing less.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Quite an ingenuous game which uses meeples as both currency as a way to activate action tiles.

This game can be quite innocuous until someone gets beaten in an auction for using up all their meeples. I wonder if it&#039;s possible to win by not having any production tiles whatsoever. Something to investigate!

Still need to play the Merchants expansion and definitely need to play this one more.

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Half way through my first game of this, I declared it one of the best games I had ever played. The amount of game that is packed into 8 cards and 30 minutes is incredible. 

Definitely the best &quot;filler&quot; game I&#039;ve played so far, and something that sets the benchmark. It&#039;s games like these that I&#039;m searching for, and the ones that deserve to be in my collection.

There&#039;s so much beauty inherent in the design, I always get this feeling of wanting to affect change, to make a move, and ultimately regretting it when I make a move too far. I never seem to regret not making a move though; I need more patience.

29/06/14 - Played the partnership version and this game was fantastic! This game just gets better and better. It&#039;s amazing how the limited actions can confound new players, but after the first game it just clicks. The partnership version is really interesting, and the ability to not only monitor your opponents but pay attention to your partner and their signalling makes this an absolute delight. My partner was new to this game, and they followed my lead perfectly; I began by trying to force a single colour, trapping the opponent&#039;s team into over committing before my partner made a push for a different colour. It was poetry in motion.

I can&#039;t recommend this game enough. 

4 player is far and away the best way to play this game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I played this once and won too easily. 

Games where the strongest strategy is too obvious are uninteresting to me.


- Warning: Minor strategy talk ahead - 





Get all your knights out, and just push everyone out of all the buildings. 

I&#039;ve heard that the expansion has a law that tries to mitigate this which underlies the fact that this strategy most possibly is the strongest. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>7/10/15 - Dropped rating from a 7 to a 4. To be honest this game was enjoyable the first time I played it but it never hit the table again. It was great coming up with stories as you build your family tree but one thing that soured me completely on this game were some decisions made by the publisher. 

I can&#039;t believe that the card backs were changed between the first and second printing. Not only this, but the expansion has card backs that are different to both editions! Sure, maybe the additional information of knowing whether you&#039;re drawing a card from the base/expansion is marginal at best, but it&#039;s not a satisfactory solution to this mistake. It really is poor form.

Extra Mansion Cards - Why do these cards have square corners and not rounded corners? Not sure why they&#039;re also larger than all the other cards?</comment>				</item>

Imagine a game where almost all the creatures have the following ability;

0: Do something, use this only once per turn and only during combat. 

Now imagine both you and your opponent have multiple creatures in combat. How do you know which abilities have been used? How long are you willing to sit there and stare at the board trying to work out if one particular ability needs to be used first to neutralise another ability? Does that sound fun to you? Cause it sure doesn&#039;t sound like fun to me.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is far too long for what it is. I feel like it tries to compete against Magic but it&#039;s really competing against other meaty 2 player games. I&#039;d never pick this over Twilight Struggle or Go. 

Maybe if this could be condensed into 15 minutes, this would give Magic a run for its money. Maybe.

Unfortunately it doesn&#039;t, and thus, another Magic contender falls by the way side.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>30</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;ve played Magic for years and the logged number of plays doesn&#039;t reflect the amount of Magic I&#039;ve played. I&#039;ve played it all from competitive to casual EDH; cube to battlebox.

Battlebox is the best format I&#039;ve ever played. Even better than cube!

What is Battlebox you ask? It&#039;s also called Wizard&#039;s Tower. It&#039;s a stack of cards made from all 5 colours including artifacts and multicoloured. Players have a land stack each of 1 of every basic land and 1 of each allied coloured tap-land. Both players start with a hand of 4 cards. On a player&#039;s turn, they can play a land from their land pile; otherwise it plays exactly like a normal game of magic. 

What makes this format interesting is the decision in playing the lands based on the cards in your hand. You have a maximum number of 10 lands, access to 3 of the same colour at most and for you to have access to 2 of the same colour, you have to play a tap land at some point.

The point of this format is to reduce the number of games where you simply lose to either mana flood or mana screw. Along with the relatively low power of the cards, it leads to games of attrition. It also awards players who can read their opponents making it one of the most skill intensive formats that exists in Magic.

I&#039;m not sure if the hate for Magic is warranted here on the geek, but unfortunately it is there (though the complaints about it being expensive are warranted!). If people realised how much is taken from Magic, and how huge it&#039;s influence has been on so many games, I think people would see Magic in a different light. Think about it; the whole deck building genre was highly influenced by Magic and also the drafting mechanic.

Update: I&#039;ve grown tired of the variance in Magic. Not only this, but none of the questions the game poses are particularly interesting and the majority of the decisions made in game aren&#039;t all that difficult. If you play competitively you&#039;re preparing for the fringe scenarios and making metagame calls (pick the right deck and hope to dodge all your bad matchups). Dropped this down from a 9 to a 7. I&#039;m bored of Battlebox as well as there&#039;s too many games where it&#039;s up to the draw (I knew this going in, and I think the fact that there&#039;s no mana flood/screw, it amplifies the effect of the luck of the draw). Cube can be much the same, and drafting comes down to the battle of who takes the best blue cards as noone wants to draft the red deck. Boring.

Update 25/08/15 Rating dropped to a 4. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is such a guilty pleasure. It&#039;s so quick and easy to play, though setup can take a little while. If both players are working together to set it up, it&#039;s not too bad at all. It tickles the chuck lots of dice, have a few laughs, beer and pretzels itch.

I play with the variant where you have a pool of additional command cards that either player has access to. Been testing out between 3 to 5 cards and it&#039;s been really good. I also play the variant if there are temporary medals on the board, the player who benefits from the additional temporary medals must hold all the objectives in order to win. It doesn&#039;t matter if they&#039;ve already killed enough squads to gain the medals required to win the objective. This might imbalance some of the missions, but I&#039;ve found it a lot more fun.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I think that Classic is better than Standard and there&#039;s a definite sense of exploration. After 2 games of this, it feels very static since the map doesn&#039;t change at all.

It&#039;s okay, but for the length, I think there are better experiences out there. There may not be better equivalent experiences out there, but just there are so many quality board games, this one definitely feels dated to me. 2 games in and I&#039;ve had my fill.</comment>				</item>

I find it amusing that in the Tabletop episode, Steve Jackson was playing the game like a shark. I also realise that I wasted time watching people play this game. 

A serious moment of regret.

	<numplays>48</numplays>			<comment>Fantastic game! I prefer playing with variant where you&#039;re allowed to draw up to 5 tiles instead of just 3. When you draw 5 tiles,  you put 2 back, discard 1 and keep the remaining 2.

Working out combat isn&#039;t particularly difficult, just need to grab a few extra coloured tokens and just note down which units have acted! The ios does have it charms though, working out combat for you, the fact that I can play it at any time of the day or night. Learning all the different factions is really fun.

Best played quickly, this isn&#039;t the kind of game where you want things to drag.

This is a lot more fun with 3+ players. Loses a ton of charm at the 2 player count. You really need to play multiple games with the same group as to watch people change strategies.

King of Siam is still my favourite filler, but this is a close second.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Slightly long, but very engaging. The end can be a bit of a mathematical puzzle, trying to work out exactly how much you can bid on new powerplants/buy resources and how much you need to spend on expanding into new cities.

It&#039;s fun though! I think this is the gateway game that I was after. Something a bit meatier, with none of the rules overhead.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>At first I thought this was mildly interesting with the mini rondel of 3 spaces. Unfortunately there&#039;s just not enough game here.

What&#039;s even worse is that the AI in the ios version is not very good. I once had a conversation with someone while playing the ios version, barely paying attention to the game, and I won. I couldn&#039;t even recall what happened in the last 3-4 turns of the game.

For those who missed out on the free download, let me put it like this; I don&#039;t think you missed out.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>When this first came out I was enamored with it. I loved dice at the time. I played this a few times, then tried to change it a few times, hoping to find a cool game in this design space.  

I found nothing except a dead end of unfun.

Marvel Dice Masters was marginally better, but still not really worth it in the end.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>104</numplays>			<comment>My first play of this was an utter disaster. I was taught by someone who had only previously played once before; which meant that she had no idea what all the icons meant and didn&#039;t understand all the cards.

A second teaching game wouldn&#039;t happen till a year later, and finally understanding all the icons, it was a curious experience. I&#039;ve since played it numerous times against the AI, losing miserably as I tried to come to grasp with the strategies. 

It&#039;s been an interesting journey but not something entirely enjoyable. The AI is good, which has made it quite a steep learning curve but I keep wondering where the fun is. Sure it&#039;s entertaining when I win against the AI, but there are times I feel like I&#039;ve been lucky. Drawing that 6 cost development card, or 7 cost military planet just in the nick of time to secure a win. The most thematic part of this game is the military strategy; everything else is a bit of a wash. 

What&#039;s the difference between this game and Innovation which I really enjoy? The fact that in Innovation, almost every ability is broken in the right circumstances and you set yourself up to take advantage of the cards that are coming up - the cards coming up are set within a band of varying effects. You can&#039;t do that in Race for the Galaxy, you set yourself up and sometimes you get there, sometimes you don&#039;t. It&#039;s a real lack of control.

Would I recommend this game? Sure? It&#039;s okay. 

At least noone can say I didn&#039;t give this game a fair shake.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;ve had my fill on this. This game can often turn into a coin flip.

The last game was the most memorable, and also the most frustrating. 

There was one mission left. Both teams were tied, but the good side (including me) had stumbled on a winning combination who had successful passed the previous mission. 

One of my best mates somehow got into his head that this winning combination included a spy. He proceeded to veto 3 people in a row picking the same team. 

We lost.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is alright, nothing special though. It felt very much like Alhambra to me, with special abilities on the tiles. It also felt extremely random, random currency draw, random tile draw. The special abilities added to the down time and added a bit of AP, but they also added a bit of spice to your turn. Eh, take it or leave it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This was cute. It was playing a dice game which isn&#039;t a variation on Yahtzee but there are flaws in this design. The fact that it&#039;s not guaranteed that a particular action will occur makes this quite chaotic. An opponent may want to settle but just hope that someone else is. Or their dice simply don&#039;t allow them to settle. That&#039;s a bit of an issue. 

I&#039;d like to play this game again, and it was definitely more enjoyable than Race for the Galaxy. Custom dice are cool.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m going to preface this by saying I have never played an 18xx game before. I want to, but haven&#039;t had the opportunity to. 

My board game journey has come a long way and I see this as a milestone for me as a gamer. I&#039;ve gone from Ameritrash, to Euros, to heavy economic/finance games. 

Building up private companies only to float them and then control them to do your bidding is utterly fascinating. At the same time, you tiptoe around and try to build up capital, while stopping people from trying to take your public corporations over! 

The final round involved me and another opponent intently staring at the middle of the board trying to calculate how many shares of my corporation we could each buy, all while realising that as we bought shares we were gaining value. My company went from a company that wasn&#039;t worth shit all to being the one worth the most in a single round. All of this in the training game version. I am seriously impressed with this game.

I must admit that I lost by $20. I don&#039;t know how exactly, but I want to do better. It&#039;s the same feeling of wanting to do better as in Age of Steam. 

The really crazy thing is, we only played the short version. I desperately want to get this to the table again.

This is where my 18xx journey begins.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I really need to play this with 4. With 2, it&#039;s not very compelling. Rating is based on potential.

Update: The mini expansion adds some pretty cool ideas. I quite enjoy it! I&#039;ve also been testing out the rusting of trains but I still need to work out some kinks. It definitely makes the game a lot more cutthroat as people can get stuck and not be able to run lines every turn. It adds a really interesting dynamic.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Seasons is a draft game, with more meat on the bones than 7 Wonders. Its a curious game and I remained intrigued after my first play, enough to give it a second chance. The most recent play left me less inclined to play again since it I drafted quite well, only to have an opponent draw extra cards to steal a win. 

I felt like there wasn&#039;t much chance for me to change strategies as the &#039;Draw a Card&#039; option didn&#039;t come up on the dice so I was locked into a losing strategy. I wonder if this game wouldn&#039;t benefit from multiple drafts between years only so you have more options to maneuver.

The artwork is gorgeous, just a pity the game isn&#039;t as rich as I&#039;d like. Magic the Gathering is still the best draft game in existence, everything just pales in comparison to it.

15/07/14 - Rating dropped from 4 to 2. The taxing strategy seems incredibly dominant, drowning out any other strategy. The game is swingy (with the luck of the draw) and devoid of answers to the tax strategy. I&#039;m done with this game.

15/10/14 - Rating dropped from 2 to 1. Not sure why I didn&#039;t just drop this straight to 1. Never playing this again.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Wow is this fiddly. For the type of game it is, and the amount of maintenance that is required to run this game, just forget it. 

This would be better as an app than a real card game. It&#039;s such a clunky design and feels like something designed by a bunch of budding designers thinking about how to make a cool card game. 

Card game design has come a long way, and for someone to not at least learn from the mistakes of others just screams to me as either laziness or ignorance. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s the latter, but for all the hate that Magic the Gathering receives here on BGG, Sentinels of the Multiverse is far and away a poorer and more terrible design than Magic will ever be.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A light/middle-weight euro game with an interesting weather system. I&#039;m unsure if this game is that good as a 2 player game, as it went for far too long. We drew 4 white cubes for the entire game which meant that everything was left up to the players. 

The mechanic of drawing cubes randomly from a bag, and if they&#039;re white, they speed the internal game clock is rather inelegant. It portrays a lack of understanding of mathematics; chalking up to the fact that situations like our game come up so rarely that it doesn&#039;t matter. To be more precise, by using such a mechanic, you lose control of how a game plays out. That&#039;s a serious flaw in my eyes.

I&#039;d shudder to think what I would have thought if the game did nothing but spit out white cubes and the game essentially played itself.</comment>				</item>

Boy oh boy was this fun! It wasn&#039;t the most brain-burning game under the sun but it was just so fantastic. Intense and thrilling when using the timers, definitely something football fans should check out.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>This is one of the most enjoyable and refreshing board game experiences to date. I love how this shakes up the co-operative genre up by making it impossible for a player to tell everyone else what to do. Even if such a player exists in the group, make them the captain! 

There&#039;s been some really funny moments including people moving up and down elevators (for no reason) and someone saying mid-game &#039;I don&#039;t even know where I am...&#039;.. wait, that was me. 

Fun times! :meeple:

	<numplays>126</numplays>			<comment>As crazy as this sounds, this replaced Dominion for me. What I&#039;m after in a pure deck builder is quick set up time, quick playing time and just none of the headaches that so many deck builders seem to fall victim to. 

It does lose the intricacies where the closer you are to winning, the harder it becomes to win as you simply need to reduce your opponent&#039;s life total to 0 and don&#039;t have victory point cards clogging up your deck. At the same time, not having to count and see who won at the end is a plus. 

Quick, fun, fantastic!

Update 01/03/15 - Dropped from a 8 to a 6. There are more issues; I wonder if big money is just disguised in this game and thus less of a problem. The random flip can be incredibly frustrating (even though games can be quite fast). It&#039;s still enjoyable but I think I may be bored of it. The expansions seem to lead to longer games which detracts from what made Star Realms so great.

Update 10/04/15 - Dropped from a 6 to a 4. This is just marginally better than Dominion for the length it takes. Otherwise forget it; being on the receiving end because your opponent just has perfect money and the perfect card flips after you buy is one of the worst feelings in gaming. The AI in the ios app is a rampant cheater. I&#039;ve lost count of the number of times where I&#039;ve bought a 8 cost base, only to end up dying before drawing it, and it being in the last 5 cards of my deck.

Update 22/05/15 - Dropped from a 4 to a 3. I can&#039;t even play the iOS app anymore due to the amount of cheating the AI employs. It&#039;s maddening; to the point where it feels like the game is playing me.

Update 19/06/15 - Dropped to a 1. I&#039;m never going to play this game again.

Update 02/07/15 - Upgraded back to a 5. This is fine once in a while, and only with the expansions. At least the random events and the new cards make this a little fresher. I refuse to play just the base game or the app with just the base game. I know the events aren&#039;t everyone&#039;s cup of tea, but this game is already incredibly high variance, you can&#039;t really take this all too seriously.

It makes me more interested in checking out Age of Steam!

Update - Rated from 6 to 5 (31/07/14): Finally got to play Age of Steam. No real interest in coming back to this one.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>This game is fantastic! One of the best games I have played in my short stint in the hobby. The rules are dense but the gameplay is intriguing. 

Random fact: I found out from a play tester that the team mechanic used to be based on the total number of pooled points for a team. The team with the lower amount of points would be knocked out, and from the winning team, the person with the most points would be declared the winner.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Best economic game ever they said.. &quot;they&quot; were wrong.

Regardless, this has all the trappings of a terrible game. The constant checking of other people&#039;s tableau&#039;s which is made difficult by the graphics, the randomness of the tiles which come out and the almost useless scale as money is generally not THAT free flowing and the overall fiddliness for a game of this weight. 

Not fun.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Summoner Wars distills wizard battles into a miniature-esque board game without the miniatures. It&#039;s quick to play and the variety of differing Summoners without the need to (though you certainly can if you choose to) deck build makes this a great game. I may never get to the highest level of skill required to play this game (and all the different strategies that come with that), but it doesn&#039;t stop me from enjoying it!

Shortest game of Summoner Wars, 2 turn victory! Boosted my summoner by 4 attacks, flew over a wall with an angel, then proceeded to bash an out of position opposing summoner.

Special shout out to Plaid Hat Games, excellent customer service!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>This is less offensive than 7 Wonders and while I admit that this bar isn&#039;t set very high considering my distaste of 7 Wonders.

I&#039;d use this game just to illustrate drafting if I couldn&#039;t properly explain how drafting the mechanic worked. That&#039;s about all it&#039;s good for.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Way too expensive for what you get in the box, I don&#039;t think it plays well with 3 due to the fact that the board changes way too much in between turns. 

The art is gorgeous on the cards though; I&#039;d be curious to play it with 2, and even more curious about the re-release!

Update: I&#039;ve now seen the new art for the re-release, coupled with the new price point, there is a chance I&#039;ll revisit this again. There&#039;s just too much coming out these days that if your game stumbles when it first comes out, it&#039;s so hard to make a come back.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>My first play of this was quite simply a revelation. It&#039;s been quite evident that at the time of writing this, that we&#039;re in the middle of the light to middle-weight Euro revolution. After playing a lot of light to medium-weight games, this wowed me with the various interconnected mechanics and fantastic gameplay. 

The thing was, we played some of the rules wrong and it was still fantastic! I&#039;m so ecstatic that people continue to make games like this! As a slight aside, this game buried Kingdom Builder for me. Whatever interest I had in that game died when I played Terra Mystica.

I can&#039;t wait to get to play this more and learn the ins and outs of all the factions. The expansion looks fantastic as well and I can&#039;t wait to get my hands on it! What&#039;s really crazy is, I actually had this on my shelf for 6 months; I can&#039;t believe it sat on my shelf for that long.

	<numplays>16</numplays>			<comment>I find this game fascinating and extremely fun. Playing it exclusively with 2, there&#039;s definitely room for good play though it feels quite limiting. 

There was a recent game where I lost a pawn due to it being ejected into space and it actually won the game for me. Having one less pawn meant I didn&#039;t always have to land in certain spots and it also meant I could control how the opponent could move. Fantastic!

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is THE civilization game and is proof that not all civilization games require a map!

The story arc is beautiful, and the gameplay is fantastic. It&#039;s an engine builder with resource and card management. Changing strategies on the fly can be difficult but it&#039;s something that I personally don&#039;t mind and find thematic.

2 players is arguably a little wonky due to the strong emphasis on military (although I admit that I&#039;m always trying to get away with as little military as possible). I&#039;m definitely looking forward to playing it with 3 players which hopefully alleviates the issues.

I upgraded the components immediately with the cubes that you can purchase from the Geekstore and can only begin to imagine how painful it would be to play with little cylinders which roll straight off the table!

Waiting for the updated version so I can add this back into my collection!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>Waiting for the updated edition. :) ETA: 2015!</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Wow, this game is amazing. Nothing short of brilliant. It&#039;s a shame it&#039;s taken me so long to finally get this to the table. It&#039;s an amazing piece of game design, though that&#039;s to be expected from Knizia. 

I can see why people complain about not drawing enough red tiles but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really an issue. I haven&#039;t personally found myself in a situation where I need to win an internal conflict or go bust, and there&#039;s a lot of different ways to go about scoring points. I do think that people get a bit too attached to the kingdoms they build. 

4 player is delightfully confrontational, while 3 player is still good, but not as much. It&#039;s one of the few games where you&#039;re left wondering how you could improve such a design.

Wonderfully thematic and amazing to play!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played the non-auction version. I was quite excited about this game, but it turned out to be quite disappointing. The random tile draw, with 2 of us drawing 2 or 3 hexes of treasures meant that those players could complete full sets fairly easily. 

It also meant that those without treasure sets seemed to languish very far behind, losing in the end by about 100 points. 

Drawing the volcano tile was also really bad as it ate up another one of your draws and I luckily drew it twice! 

I do want to try the auction variant, but it was such a disappointing first play that it&#039;s really unlikely that I&#039;ll give this another shot.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played this once, adding a map made no difference. From my one game, it seemed like just going for VP&#039;s while ignoring the board may have been the best strategy. 

That&#039;s enough to make me not want to play this again while Dominion exists.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I believe this is a reskin of Category 5 and/or 6 nimmt!

I had more fun just talking about the tactics in the first 30 seconds of learning the game than actually playing it. The only real decisions are when the piles are hitting their limit.

It&#039;s another filler, but not one that I particularly cared for.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>First play and I&#039;m not too sure of what to think. 

There&#039;s a semi-interesting game here but it doesn&#039;t capture the same kind of magic that Twilight Struggle does. I&#039;d pick Twilight Struggle over this every day of the week and I think the fact that it relies heavily on icons detracts from the theme. I think this design choice, the fact that it&#039;s heavy on icons, means that players don&#039;t necessarily need to read the event names at all. I think this takes a lot away from the experience.

A lot of my opinions are a comparison between Wir Sind Das Volk! and Twilight Struggle, so bear with me. Part of the beauty of Twilight Struggle is the combination of theme and mechanics to create a &#039;what if&#039; scenario. There is a real global struggle that is played out on the board, sacrifices have to be made to further your agenda. You learn to fear and cheer certain events as you and your opponent play them. While Wir Sind Das Volk! is played on a much smaller scale comparably, none of the events are memorable. Twilight Struggle dresses up the push-pull and cold war buildup through the memorable cards, Wir Sind Das Volk! does not.

What you&#039;re left with is a really mechanical, calculable exercise. Why calculable? Because the majority of the cards are in a common pool. You spend a few minutes looking at the common pool and looking at your two cards and working out which cards you need to take and when. I take this card to build up 3, then you take this card to take away 4, then I take this card to push this track right x spaces, then you take that card to push this other track left y spaces. At this point, who cares what the events are or what they&#039;re called.

The end of age/era multi-step process resolution is clunky at best. I simply spent too much time trying to work out this process than enjoying the actual game. It&#039;s predictable and takes away from the tension compared to the variable time scoring found in Twilight Struggle.

There&#039;s really two flaws in this design; the first being the large shared pool of cards which has thus influenced the design to heavily rely on icons. The second being the end of age/era multi-step resolution. Because of this, I don&#039;t think this game is quite there.

In the end, a second game never came. There was just no enthusiasm to get this back to the table and thus I sold it off. It&#039;s really disappointing, I admire both designers, they&#039;ve created some real gems in the past. This isn&#039;t one of them though.

Update 17/03/15: I&#039;ve had this on my mind as more and more people have sung this game&#039;s praises. I&#039;ve updated the comment to hopefully better reflect my views and downgraded the rating from a 4 to a 3.

Additional comment 08/07/15: I&#039;ve had this thought in my mind for a long time now. I think the fact that the cards have both German and English take a lot away from the theme. I understand that this way you have a game that can sell in both markets, but by doing this, there&#039;s an inherent flaw - it takes away from the theme. I found that the first couple of times, I would read the German name first. Since I don&#039;t speak/read German the names made no sense to me. Yes, the English names are underneath but it was a lost cause. I stopped reading the names on the cards completely and all I was left with was just a bunch of symbols. Twilight Struggle doesn&#039;t have this issue because the cards are 100% in English. This isn&#039;t an issue if you understand German, but I found it something that actively detracted from the game experience.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>The more I play this, the more it grows on me. It&#039;s starting to get interesting!

22/05/15 Updated rating from a 4 to a 5.

30/06/15 Updated rating from a 5 to a 7.

07/08/15 Updated rating from a 7 to a 8. - I really like the fact that there aren&#039;t a ton of rules to this game and it plays quite smoothly. It distills the whole notion of reading your opponent and anticipating what they&#039;ll do. There&#039;s this huge pull between being in the zone and scrambling out of the hole - it&#039;s all in your head!

09/08/15 Updated rating from a 8 to a 9. - Forget it, this game is fantastic! The characters are nice and varied and they have such a fantastic feel. I love chaining cards into huge combos. It mimics the type of fighters I like to play in Street Fighter. This is a great game!

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Finally got this to the table, it&#039;s so fantastic! 

It&#039;s peculiar that this game brings out the inner auctioneer/art critic in all of us considering it&#039;s just a bunch of auctions.

The Stamps version is still in shrink, the version I play with is the Wargames HK version. Both are beautiful. :meeple:</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>My first game lead to me destroying myself by helping end the game for the winner. Probably shouldn&#039;t have done that.. 

Fantastic game with beautiful pastel pieces. It&#039;s amazingly simple and has a Go like feel to it.</comment>				</item>
