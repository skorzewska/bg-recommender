Hi there![/b]

Chances are you just clicked on my Games Owned or Commented, saw a bunch of [i]Munchkin[/i] stuff and recoiled in disgust.

It&#039;s not what you think, honest!

I assure you I am a [i]discerning gamer[/i] who lives for true strategery and decisions [i]so meaningful[/i] they make grown men weepy.  I must admit, however, that I do enjoy &quot;stupid fun&quot; just as much as a rarified mind-fight.

So, the [i]Munchkin[/i] thing:  It&#039;s a sweet little bonbon when played by 3 or 4 RPG geeks inside 45 minutes as a storytelling/party game.  And while you [i]could[/i] play it with 6 angry people for a multi-hour marathon of boredom, bile and eye-biting I can&#039;t in any way recommend that.

With that out of the way I bid you welcome to my Carnival of Comments—where the Strong Man has a pituitary disorder, the Bearded Lady isn&#039;t, and the Geek strangles hobos on his day off.

Enjoy![/COLOR]

It seems *fun enough* but every time I&#039;m left with a &quot;is that all there is?&quot; feeling.

UPDATE:  After sitting down to play this again over bowls of tortilla soup and Thai veggie stew I get the impression it&#039;s more of an activity than a game over which you can exert much control.  Tick the &quot;throwing cards with friends and family&quot; box.

Truly *fun enough* but waaay too random to take seriously or bother burning brain cells over.

	<numplays>25</numplays>			<comment>Though rife with shocking nudity and Masonic devilry, the game functions well enough for what it is, a &quot;super-filler&quot; that hosts up to seven players in 30 minutes.  It&#039;s pretty, engaging, and the small decisions are nice.  At the end you&#039;re rewarded with an awesome/mediocre/just-plain-sad tableau that tells the story of your soaring/forgotten/broke-ass civilization.

[i]But...[/i]

The game suffers grotesquely when players don&#039;t counter-pick—the player who manages to seat themselves between two milquetoasts will win with a shockingly massive score.  We&#039;re talkin&#039; 37-42-52-[b]87[/b]-33 shocking. 

&quot;What the hell were you doing?!&quot; I ask Ms. 87&#039;s neighbors.

They blink as if slapped.  &quot;I was building my civilization,&quot; they say.

&quot;For the love of God,&quot; I rave, &quot;Why did you keep passing her [i]exactly what she needed?![/i]&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; they mumble, &quot;I had other things to do.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I gurgle through clenched teeth, &quot;Like making sure she doesn&#039;t double all our scores!&quot;

So, yeah, this game requires mouth-pooping in order to work.  When everyone keeps a scatalogical eye on their neighbors—and even up- and downstream some—it&#039;s a nice little card drafting game that&#039;s over quickly enough that you don&#039;t notice the undigested corn.

When playing with people who refuse to poop in their neighbor&#039;s mouths, I [i]strongly suggest[/i] you sit between two of them in order to maximize your score.

UPDATE:  Much better (I&#039;d rate it an 8) with the [gameid=92539] expansion.  Leaders allow you to focus your strategy (just a little), or at least build some synergy.  Or, with a poor selection, have hilariously random historical figures running your show.  [i]Hatshepsut in Rome?![/i]  ~LULZ

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>I rate the base game a 7, but it&#039;s an 8 with Leaders thrown into the mix.  If you&#039;re lucky, you get to pick leaders that work well with your civ&#039;s baseline goal (like Greek philosophers in Babylon, or generals in Rhodes) or at least people who work well together so you can build synergy across the ages.  If you&#039;re unlucky, or have a neighbor who understands how to poop downstream, you&#039;ll end up with a cartoon mishmash of random historical figures.

&quot;Hatshepsut running Rome?  More like Hatshepsut&#039;s enraged mummy drinking Roman orphans all day!&quot;

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>Purty as hell and has all the hallmarks of a classic Ameritrash filler:  cool minis, art above and beyond the simple gameplay, death and humiliation.  Looking very forward to this one, with expectations set to &quot;appropriate&quot;.

Of course, the fact that this didn&#039;t come with pre-painted minis caused me to run around my mother&#039;s basement in a rage, wearing nothing but stained tighty-whities and red-faced indignation.

UPDATE:  A ton of fun with the right mindset, e.g., played quickly as a simple push-your-luck filler.  Played conservatively, thoughtfully, carefully... it blows.  I&#039;ve taken to screaming [i]&quot;RUN!!!&quot;[/i] at people who treat their turn like they&#039;re setting up a [i]zwischenzug.[/i]

Also, the boulder is the primary source of pressure in the game—when it&#039;s really rolling the game is tense and hilarious as people get popped and grease the kinetic groove with their innards.  When the boulder rolls are low, the opposite is true.  The game lags horribly.  This makes the experience kind of hit or miss depending on those rolls.

In spite of these flaws (boring with conservative play and bad boulder rolls) [i]The Adventurers[/i] hits the mark, at least as an occasional amusement.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>50</numplays>			<comment>[b]tl;dr[/b] — [i]It&#039;s time to get excited about farming!  Farming.  And man, did we ever get excited.  This thing hit like dynamite fishing and then we fought a massive war over it.  And when I finally got to plowin&#039; with my doughty farm-wife the earth gave up its dead because they only moved the headstones.  50 plays.[/i]

[b][thread=393626][/thread][/b]

UPDATE:  Well, there&#039;s massive shrinkage in Hell—I picked up a copy and I&#039;m actually looking forward to playing it!

UP-UPDATE:  I can totally see how people can rate this a 10.  It&#039;s charming and mildly haunting, and there are actually opportunities to dump a turd in the downstream player&#039;s punchbowl.  &quot;Yeah, I didn&#039;t need that food.  I went fishing just to watch your kids starve.&quot;

Ultimately, though, this gets stuck in the dreaded 7 ghetto—good enough, but missing that special something.  And that something is a theme that isn&#039;t farming.

UP-UP-UPDATE:  After 17 plays I&#039;m bumping this up to an 8.  My wife [i]loves[/i] it, and I find her enthusiasm for the game infectious.  With two relatively experienced players—and wine—the game flies by; the struggle and decision-making is a pleasant diversion, and the tiny model farm you wind up with at the end is nifty.

FINAL ANALYSIS:  All things being equal, the cards make or break the game.  Either you get a fistful of synergy that showers you with freebies or you sit and watch someone else play that game.  I suppose this could be mitigated with some kind of card draft or other time-consuming setup step, but really, the game isn&#039;t that deep or robust to support such shenanigans.  This sensitivity to the vagaries of luck keeps the game firmly wedged in the &quot;whipped dessert&quot; category—very tasty, but ultimately nothing more than sugar and air.

...and more:

Revising down to a 7 after 27 plays.  Familiarity is bleeding this one out, especially after a brutal string of games with poor card draws.  Also, the tension in the 5p game is unpleasant, or, more correctly, is out of whack with the payoff for suffering it.  There are only so many times you can circle the drain of reductive choice where it&#039;s pastry, pie, cookie, crumb, bowl of poop before losing your mind and fantasizing about rolling some dice and kicking in the door of the guy who wasted the sow space for baking and using the axe you invented on his family.

&quot;You got Ceramics?  I got Clogs, bitches!  CLOOOGS!!!&quot;

So far the 2p game is my favorite—it&#039;s over quickly enough that a bad hand is tolerable.  Two or 3p is definitely the sweet spot for this.

...aaand revising down to a 6 after 38 plays.  Not timeless, not a classic, and it&#039;s about farming.  [i]Farming![/i]

UP-UP-UP-UPDATE:  [-]45[/-] 50 (!) plays, bumping it back up to a 7.  My wife really, [i]really[/i] loves it, and that softens my hard heart.  Besides, our last game was really weird—I didn&#039;t try my usual min-maxing by following the script that always nets 40+ points—I went after a wheat baron&#039;s seven-room stone mansion with constant barbeques.  Meanwhile, my wife deviated from her script as well, with the game ending up 24-21 in my favor.  I like weird.

Original comment:

[i]Finally, a solution to the 400-year-old problem of four-player farming...  This &quot;game&quot; gets a well-deserved 1 for being the epitome of Euroslack; as a good gaming buddy always says when Euros hit the table (with a wet plop, I might add):  &quot;What am I in this one, a farmer?&quot;  It pulls a 1.11 for only being available in Ancient Atlantean (that crazy mouth-stumbling they call a &quot;language&quot;)—note to the designer:  I hope you make a bajillion dollars selling this to all those multitudes of Atlantis who are obviously going to be going game-nuts over it.  Sheesh.  [BGG CON III got [i]played[/i]][/i]

Final analysis:

[i]By all accounts this game is the Second Coming of [gameid=18602] With Three Testicles.*  The tidal wave of hype surrounding this should be more than enough to obliterate the actions of 17 rogue BGGers.  But I am intrigued by the fact that it only took 17 people (out of how many tens of thousands who traffic this site?) to rock the boat...[/i][/q]

[size=7]*Once upon a time, [i]Caylus[/i] was the savage hotness, the blazing terminus that divided gamers into two camps—the lofty intelligentsia who breathed the Language of God and shat meaningful decisions and the drooling idiots who would mold dice out of poop and gamble with their own teeth on the outcome.  In the decade between then and now (2005-2015) the turd-rollers won.  [i]They won.[/i][/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>How does it happen?  How?  How can a two-player game blow out like a prolapsed colon, 43-21?  We started with the same potential, nothing but fertile humps of land and 14 cards and then... [i]sudden bloody spandex[/i].

THERE IS NO GOD

Man, I had plans... When I fanned those cards I saw a shining path straight out of subsistence farming and into a fancy stone house filled with thick-legged daughters who could pull plow and carry water.  Instead I got a surfeit of freakishly large vegetables and one single, stunted scion.

Oh, but how the neighbors carried on, with their prize sheep and eating meat at every harvest with the progeny sliding straight out of the birth canal and into the pot.  Clipped the cord with the lid, they did!  Damn them all and their noisy lot, their pink-rubbed children all wearing clothing and such.  As if!

The boy and I go now to bury these man-sized carrots beneath the waning Moon like five neat graves and we&#039;ll see which Dark Forces come for whom.  Oh, [i]we shall see...[/i]

[microbadge=14795]

The less that is said about the &quot;Five (!) Begging Cards Incident&quot; the better.  After forty-some-odd games you&#039;d think it was unthinkable—but there I was, helping a newb avoid disaster and starving children and BAM it was harvest time and me without any kind of food engine other than perhaps eating our own young.  And so my offspring, my beloved child, haunted those woods as emaciated as a living skeleton, hollow-eyed and pantsless, with one withered arm bouncing uselessly against its side as it loped through the shadows.

And all the while those Others just watched and whispered, gathered round their groaning tables piled high with meat and veg in their cozy stone houses.

Disaster, I tell you, is the root of madness.

[microbadge=14795]

&quot;Daddy,&quot; the children wail, &quot;make food come out of the ground again like you did that one time!&quot;

&quot;Shut up, [i]shut up[/i]!&quot; I rage, drunk on fermented moss.  &quot;I swear I&#039;ll set this goddamn place on fire!&quot;

&quot;If only you knew how to start one,&quot; snorts my doughty farm-wife.

My opponent got several nice things while I got sent to gaol and cursed for butchering a tasty, tasty unicorn (-3 VP).

HEY, WAKE UP!

—this game actually does a [i]brilliant job[/i] of modeling the pirate&#039;s life:  corpses of the drowned are lashed together into rafts for the living...

[imageid=1953589 original]
...and we will often find ourselves in sweaty piles, unable to move (languid and spent, I suppose) here and there.

This one gave the seven-second delay one hell of a workout, let me tell you.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A mild, yet entertaining diversion.  And, yes, you can say, &quot;Oh, the humanity!&quot; one too many times.

UPDATE:  I really like this.  You try to assemble the best zeppelin manufactory possible and then dice off like crazy to build more—and better—airships than anyone else.  If you like rolling dice (and that &quot;baby needs a new tank of [i]Blaugas[/i]&quot; feelin&#039;) and putting together machines of cascading card effects to let you roll more and different dice, and you happen to like zeppelins, too, this is worth a look.

But this just really isn&#039;t my bag.  Every goddamn thing gets you points, and we&#039;re all so busy drinking from the stinging gush of the point-hose that it&#039;s difficult to quickly gauge relative position until it suddenly stops and we&#039;re left standing there in the silence, blinking against the wet—soaked and dripping—and it turns out someone&#039;s more engorged than everyone else.

[q=&quot;MScrivner&quot;]Android is not really a game - it&#039;s a delivery system for a work of literature.[/q]
Like playing Poker with Burrough&#039;s [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique]cut-ups[/url].

[microbadge=7155]

[i]Seedy, sleazy, brilliant.[/i]

A dizzyingly ambitious design, a story engine with a mechanical core that has so many wheels within wheels that the conspiracy you&#039;re manufacturing has to be real... right?

I imagine this will hit a 10 for me, but repeat plays will tell.

The good news is I&#039;ll have no trouble getting this to the table for more.

UPDATE:  Why wait?  It&#039;s a 10.  How can I say that?  Because [thread=364669][i]Android[/i] haunts me[/thread], that&#039;s why.

[microbadge=7811]

[b]FOR YOUR FIRST GAME:[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]• Set aside a five-hour block a week in advance.[/COLOR]
This is not a pick-up game—it&#039;s an EVENT.

[COLOR=#FF0000]• Have all players read the rules ahead of time.[/COLOR]
If they&#039;re unwilling to do this they&#039;re not up for the experience.

[COLOR=#FF0000]• 3 players ONLY.[/COLOR]
Five is just waaay too many.  Four is long and downtime can be brutal.  I&#039;ll only play this with three from now on.


[b]FOR SUBSEQUENT GAMES WITH NEW PLAYERS:[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]• Have them read the rules in advance.[/COLOR]
Explaining the rules [i]as part of the session[/i] can kill the momentum and turn all the fun into a gooey gray mess...

	<numplays>22</numplays>			<comment>[center][size=6][COLOR=#878787]LIFETIME GAME [microbadge=28495]:star:[microbadge=28496] &quot;PLAY FOREVER&quot;[/COLOR][/size][/center]

An RPG in a box, playable in a single evening.  It&#039;s a lot of &quot;pull a card and read the encounter&quot; followed by lots of dice rolling.  If either of those mechanics bother you, stay away.  If you don&#039;t mind (and I certainly don&#039;t) then this is the best of the genre.

[b]PROS[/b]

- A rich and detailed experience.

- High replay value. 

- Cooperative play.

- Solo play!

- Art and production values to die for.

[b]CONS[/b]

- A sprawling rulebook with almost no summary.

- Little rules that are easy to miss, and change the game when you get them wrong.  (For example, we overlooked the fact that closing a gate banishes all monsters with like symbols.  This made a lot of really awful monsters hang around much longer than they would have otherwise.)  Expect to play the game incorrectly several times.

- The final battle is nothing but dice.  (Who knew Nyarlathotep could be defeated by nothing more than the world&#039;s longest [i]Yahtzee[/i] game?)

- It&#039;s long.  Really, really long.

[b]BOTTOM LINE[/b]

[i]Arkham Horror[/i] is thick, meaty and completely immersive.  This also means it takes a while, but that&#039;s not always a bad thing.  It fills an evening to brimming with blood, terror and good clean fun.  Recommended for players who enjoy the [i]Call of Cthulhu[/i] RPG.

UPDATE:  After several plays, the game is becoming easy—almost too easy.  With a crack team of selfless, team-playing RPGers it&#039;s a pretty simple thing to win by sealing six gates or closing all gates while having the requisite gate trophies for victory.  This drops the game to a 7, but it still gets the extra point for the whole Mythos thing (and the fact that it&#039;s easily handicapped).

UP-UPDATE:  I have realized, with much dismay, that there really is no &quot;horror&quot; in [i]Arkham Horror[/i].  It is extremely rare for anyone to get devoured, so much so that no one really ever worries about it at all.  Also, the characters don&#039;t &quot;wear out&quot; like they do in the RPG—they are not eroded by repeated contact with the mentally-corrosive Mythos.  Again, house rules will fix this (by having max sanity reduced by 1 every time you fail a Will check), but still, I shouldn&#039;t have to put the horror in Arkham...  It shoulda been there in the first place.

My rating holds at an 8 for all the kicks in the knickers we get out of the experience, but just barely.

UP-UP-UPDATE:  Forget all the whining.  The expansions fix everything and take the experience to a well-deserved 10.  So, an 8 for the base game, a 10 with any expansion (especially Dunwich—goddamn Dunwich).

ALSO:  Have the First Player act as the &quot;Interim Keeper&quot; by drawing and reading encounter cards for all players.  Makes it way more fun when you don&#039;t know what your choice (or failure) will bring when you have to make a decision.  Allows for more storytelling, too.

FINALLY:  I will always use the Injury &amp; Madness cards from Dunwich and the Final Battle cards from Kingsport in every play.

PS.  Played once with 8p—NEVER AGAIN.  The sweet spot is most definitely 4p.

(Includes one each of the [gameid=155643] &amp; [gameid=155645].)

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The Nyarlathotep expansion—we play with the Big N and the Dark Pharaoh herald.

Played this once, and incorrectly.  The experience was... diluted.  Looking forward to playing this for reals.

UPDATE:  The problem with the first play was running the Permanent Exhibit with all the cards shuffled into the base game.  This made the Dark Pharaoh cards very rare and the game near-indistinguishable from a base scenario.  For our second play we used [i]only[/i] the DP cards (replacing the Mythos, Gate and Arkham Encounter decks) and it made for a sweet bit of ugly:  things looked utterly bleak by turn two, and when Nyarlathotep arrived (something that never happens to us anymore in the base game) we had only shut a single gate.  Two players got scrubbed and it literally came down to the wire before we beat him back and shut him out of our world.

PURGED &amp; replaced with the [thing=95683]Revised Edition[/thing].</comment>				</item>

Better than the base game alone, if by &quot;better&quot; I mean more uncontrollable wailing with less courageous investigators begging the brave for sweet release.

The new Injury &amp; Madness cards are great—now when you go to zero Stamina or Sanity you can choose to dump half your stuff (Items &amp; Clues) or end up with a crippled something-or-other or a mental illness instead.  Ha-ha!  That&#039;ll learn ya!

We play with one expansion at a time, so, [i]Dunwich Horror[/i] alone, with Yog-Sothoth as the Great Old One...</comment>				</item>

Don&#039;t much like Nodens or Bast—Nodens especially always felt like an anomalous tack-on in the Mythos.  Unless you can think of his anthropomorphism as an unconscious overlay, i.e., he&#039;s just as horrible as everything else Out There but for whatever reason we see him as Poseidon/Neptune.  But I&#039;m really overthinking this, aren&#039;t I?

Looking very forward to playing this one!</comment>				</item>

Originally, I hated my surface pass on this one:  the art was ugly; the gameplay simplistic, derivative and limited.

Then, after like a billion plays on the iPad, I finally &quot;got&quot; the art, appreciating the iconic, atavistic religiosity of it*, as well as the game-wide unifying aspect of having a single artist&#039;s vision throughout; and the game that seemed so simple on the surface cracked open and exposed vistas of interaction, tactics and strategy.  Every time I think I&#039;ve topped out with the killer approach I find new pathways that go deeper into weird labyrinths.

To top it off, the fantasy world presented in the game is like peeking into someone&#039;s private wank-bank of bizarre fetishes; it is wonderfully nonstandard and &quot;wiggy&quot;.

The whole shebang is a triumph of undiluted vision.

UPDATE:  8 --&gt; 7  Honestly, just wore this one out.  It was good for more digital plays than I can count (which really does put it into the &quot;outstanding&quot; category), a fantastic toy while it lasted but I find I&#039;m done with it now.

UP-UPDATE:  7 --&gt; 8  That wiggy world has pulled me back in and I find myself wanting to play constantly—[COLOR=#FF0000]it&#039;s a big badass comic book[/color] filled with interesting personalities and reality-shattering shenanigans.  God help me but I love it...  

The thing itself is a neat distillation of [thing=463]Magic[/thing]&#039;s higher points (though without the attendant depth) of art/world/story, deck building, and the chaining of ridiculous combos.  As a deckbuilder it&#039;s the quick-fix version of touching those nubbins in all the ways [thing=36218]Dominion[/thing] doesn&#039;t.

As a screen-time noodler it&#039;s like someone used my skull as a Play-Doh® Fuzzy Pumper Barber Shop™ to squeeze a wad of Solitaire and this is what came curling out of my head holes.

It&#039;s beautifully creepy—both in art and mechanics.  It&#039;s the paragon of what I love about this game.

(All plays gathered under [thing=108784]Storm of Souls[/thing].)


[size=7]Minor sour note:  The cardbacks in the expansion* are printed much lighter and less vibrant than those in [i]Storm of Souls[/i]**, making the new cards obvious.  Also, they&#039;re almost, but not quite, the same size—so riffle shuffling (the only true shuffle) is just a tad rough and the cards sort by size when overhand shuffled.  Yeah, sleeves would solve all of these &quot;problems&quot;, but I hate hate [i]hate[/i] sleeves...  

Honestly, this won&#039;t affect my ability to play &amp; enjoy the game—they are minor issues after all—but it would be nice if everything matched up and meshed without looking like glaring add-ons.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I initially found the new card mix to be a bit head-bendy, especially after a bajillion plays of the super smooth and tight [i]Chronicle of the Godslayer[/i] on the iPad.  But the Fate mechanic grew on me, as well as the expanded play-space and fun combos you can pull off.

And if what I understand about the expansion is true—that it completes a unique story arc when combined with [i]Godslayer[/i], with no further expansions to that &quot;block&quot;—then it&#039;s genius.  Not being a fan of endless expansions and bloat killing a good thing, I applaud the creators&#039; ability to self-edit.  Art wins over commerce... this time.

Story-wise, it&#039;s mega-cool that you can become that which you loathe—Samael Himself—and gather His monsters into your deck instead of sending them into the Void.  Nice nod to Nietzsche.

UPDATE:  8 --&gt; 7  Wore it out with an enormous number of digital plays.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Really cool to see how the system was tweaked in this new block, leading to a deck with mechanically familiar play but refreshingly novel strategy &amp; tactics.  And I love love [i]love[/i] the fact that the designers are keeping things constrained in discrete blocks (big box + small box).  Sure, you can use every card ever produced in one monstrous Frankendeck, but they&#039;re designed and tested to work best as separate story arcs.

As [thing=463]Magic[/thing] pros they&#039;ve distilled the best things from the Mother Game:  discrete blocks of cards designed to work well together, deck building, throwing cool combos.  The result is a high so sharp and pure it&#039;s like freebasing a Black Lotus.

Wasn&#039;t sure how I&#039;d feel about the new art as I really grokked the original stuff; in execution it&#039;s all excellent, though some of the changes are less impactful than the originals.

The foil cards lend the game a hallucinatory cast—energy blasts and tentacles and swords all writhe with a rainbow sheen.  Cool?  [i]Very.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The usual dice-fest with plastic army men.  Not sure how many plays are in the box; the strategy&#039;s pretty straightforward and I&#039;m not sure how much latitude either side has in securing the win.

That said it&#039;s not bad as a short, smack-talkin&#039;, dice-chuckin&#039; beer &amp; pretzels &quot;wargame&quot; for three.

I&#039;m willing to give it another couple shots to see if the game opens up at all.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>30</numplays>			<comment>The pleasure-density of this game is so off the charts I swear the cards are made of an alloy of Ununoctium and molten fun.  Yes, it has player elimination.  Yes, it is almost pure chaos.  So play it like a party game—we&#039;ve rarely had a game go beyond 30 minutes.  Remember, it&#039;s called [i]BANG![/i], not &quot;Marshall Resources&quot;.  

UPDATE:  I&#039;ve seen the Renegade win plenty of big games.  It&#039;s tough—it&#039;s the most difficult role to play—but it just means you have to be extra double-plus crafty with a corpse&#039;s poker face and expert timing.  Quit whining and embrace the challenge.

UP-UPDATE:  Huh—it turns out the 4-player game is actually interesting...  The Renegade knows from the get-go who the two Outlaws are and the Sheriff can start shooting willy-nilly on the first turn.  Once the first Outlaw goes down there&#039;s an interesting dynamic where the remaining Outlaw can offer to help the Sheriff to keep from getting double-teamed...

And, if nothing else, it goes [i]quick![/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>27</numplays>			<comment>Sadly, this is the most perfect version of the [i]Bang![/i] experience.  

It bums me out because I really love the original card game—the rich narrative that arises from the interplay of various Spaghetti Western tropes, the sheer volume of options and interactions, as well as the physical nod to poker.

But everyone I&#039;ve played this with—[i]everyone[/i]—says they prefer this to that.  I will admit the designers have done a brilliant job of distilling down the raw experience with very little loss of fidelity; it really does feel like [i]Bang![/i] in less than 15 minutes... but I do miss the cards held close to the vest, the bluffing, the flurry of bangs falling to the table like the fanning of a Colt&#039;s hammer.

[i]Who will be my huckleberry now?[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Surprisingly fun!  There&#039;s a wee bit of strategy in deciding how to throw your dice to best whack your opponent&#039;s dice into the holes &amp;amp; traps; also, rolling your dice to set them into a solid defensive position (when you have to roll first).  There are other choices as well—if your opponent rolls nothing but damage, you&#039;re better off simply rolling the dice for hits.  If, on the other hand, he&#039;s rolled a plethora of super hits, go for broke and chuck your dice in to knock his helter-skelter!</comment>				</item>

UPDATE:  Revised down to a 7...  to date, none of the many expansions have caught my fancy.  I just don&#039;t like the direction they took this game in, genre-wise.  There&#039;s nothing wrong with it—it&#039;s a perfectly fine game—the game world just inspires apathetic ennui in me.  So it&#039;s me, not you, [i]BattleLore[/i].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Being a huge [gameid=10630] fan—and thus predisposed to liking the Commands and Colors (C&amp;C) system in general—it was a great disappointment when the original [gameid=25417] (1st Edition) fell flat for me.  Everything I liked about C&amp;C was there, but, man—the theme was tepid.  I only got a handful of plays out of it and never bought any of the expansions...

When this came out, it wasn&#039;t even a vague shadow on my radar.  And then the whole Terrinoth retheme—[i]ugh[/i].

So if I didn&#039;t like the original and I&#039;m not a Terrinoth fan, why the hell would I give this an 8?

[b]BECAUSE IT&#039;S [i]AWESOME[/i], THAT&#039;S WHY[/b]

Seriously, it&#039;s a GREAT GAME.  The change from &quot;kill &#039;em all&quot; to &quot;hold ground/secure the objective&quot; is HUGE.  We lose the weird, gamey moments in which an entire army wheels to engulf a single solitary unit at the periphery in order to cross the win-threshold and instead we get a tense back-and-forth, rain-arrows-and-push fantasy wargame feel.  We get strategy and tactics and real maneuvering for position.

The whole Terrinoth thing fades into the background, leaving a plethora of unique unit abilities that must all be taken into account for combined arms synergy, as well as understanding how your abilities will interact with those of the enemy, for good and ill.  It&#039;s bewildering and heady at first... but once things click the armies get [i]dangerous[/i].

The way armies are mustered and scenarios built is [i]genius[/i]—with seven different scenario cards for each army we have 49 unique plays [i]just in this box alone[/i].  As the inevitable expansions hit (a Good Thing) this number will quickly crank into the realm of the Functionally Infinite.*

UPDATE:

[q=&quot;Chris Tannhauser&quot;][size=12][b]Lady Luck Is a Carnivore...[/b][/size]

...and we are all of us made of meat.  [i]Deren thought of the oft-repeated line, a favorite of one of his sergeants at battle school, as he sat his horse across from what looked for all the world like the host of hell vomited into the dawn.  The barbarians had been up all night, howling, drumming, dancing, burning things—keeping Deren&#039;s men from their rest—and now as the sun lanced between mountain peaks he could see something horrible and huge rising unsteadily in the dung-fire haze of the enemy&#039;s camp.

The line wavered.

&quot;Hold!&quot; bellowed Deren, &quot;Await the banners and trumpets!&quot;

The horses shied and stamped as the riders faked their courage through the reins.

Deren turned to the new Lord Commander, the replacement for the one that got beheaded the previous week.  &quot;It&#039;s not just men this time, sir.  New orders for the line?&quot;

The Lord Commander shifted in his tooled-leather show-saddle, stroking his chin absentmindedly.  &quot;We&#039;ll do—&quot; he waved a hand, &quot;—the usual.  If things change I&#039;ll let you know.&quot;

&quot;Sir—&quot;

&quot;I&#039;m sure something will come to me.  It&#039;s in the hands of the gods now.&quot;  He shrugged and pointed skyward.

Deren stared.[/i]


[url=http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4742]***[insert thousand-word strategy article about not relying on the luck of card draws &amp; die rolls here]***[/url]


[i]&quot;Banners!&quot; the Lord Commander shrieked.

The boys let them fly and the wind took them, unfurling to snap this way and that.

Deren thought of that old sergeant, a slight man with a hatchet-altered smile, left-handed by circumstance.  &quot;If you lean on Her, boy, She&#039;ll bite just as soon as kiss ya—but it&#039;s not the kisses you&#039;ll remember.&quot;  He would gesture with what was left of his master hand and laugh, a dark gurgling not unlike the sounds coming from the host arrayed against them.

The hunched men and worse things loped at them laughing—[/i]laughing[i]—and with the warble of the trumpets Deren put the spurs to his mount and replaced his prayers with steel in his fist.[/i][/q]

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Preliminary rating after a single four-player game.  I don&#039;t believe the potential was fully realized with this one play, and have doubts about the game with only four.  Current rating based on projected potential.  I have high hopes, but we&#039;ll see...

[q=&quot;HiveGod&quot;]Some games require you to bring more to the table than others—the best games are far more than the sum of their parts, and contain possibilities that are not spelled out in the rulebook, or even hinted at.  They must be invented by the players.  &quot;Experience&quot; games, especially, demand much of the players.  [i]BSG[/i] is guilty of this in spades.  It&#039;s intimately tied to the show, requiring that you watched it, liked it, and are willing to engage in role-playing the paranoia and terror of tooth-and-nail survival and religious genocide.  The rules and mechanics serve merely as a foundation for this play—dumping cards into a skill check is boring.  Paying attention to who is dumping cards and how many, who is abstaining and why, demanding explanations for a player&#039;s behavior during that check [i]is[/i] the game.  That&#039;s where facial expressions, body language, and too-passionate denials trip up the wolves and damn the innocent.

The mechanics of [i]BSG[/i] are not, in and of themselves, sufficiently interesting to entertain for more than 15 minutes.  They are indeed &quot;boring, fiddly and repetitive&quot;.  But as a foundation to support the emergent play of like minds, it&#039;s pretty damn fantastic.

So...  is [i]BSG[/i] a good game?  It all depends on who you have to play it with.[/q]
UPDATE:  After playing with six, this locks in at a solid eight.  The mechanical aspects of what&#039;s happening [i]on[/i] the table are nothing compared to what&#039;s happening [i]at[/i] the table.  If you sit down to this game thinking you&#039;ll be playing out tactical space battles and puzzling to solve sci-fi crises co-op style, you&#039;ll be bitterly disappointed.  Oh, sure, you&#039;ll be doing those things in a small way—but really, they are only there so you can watch how enthusiastically and competently (or not) people work to handle them...  The real game lies in the social interaction of wolves slinking among sheep while bleating helplessly.  It&#039;s all about poker faces, plausible deniability and hiding in plain sight.  It&#039;s playing on emotions, constructing compelling arguments, and working at the chinks in others&#039;.  It&#039;s pure sociopolitics, more RPG than board game—it&#039;s [i]Werewolf[/i] with a sci-fi theme and more moving parts.

PS.  With the right people, it&#039;s a hoot!

UP-UPDATE:  Bumping this up to a well-deserved nine.  Now that we have the rules down to the point where the mechanics fade into the background, [i]BSG[/i]&#039;s true potential shines through.  An incredible experience!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>34</numplays>			<comment>A game that both artists and engineers can enjoy equally.  This is one dexterity game that has it all:  strategy, tactics, bluffing, bidding, yelling and crying.  Definitely one in the [i]Why The Hell Didn&#039;t I Get This One Sooner[/i]? category.  Highly recommended for families and parties.

Also:  Don&#039;t build.  Building is for suckers.  Explore the Zen purity of the Tower That Is No Tower.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A bidding game, in the Knizia tradition, with the added ability to plan ahead.  (You can see, on the board, what&#039;s coming up for bid next, and what resources you&#039;ll need to compete.)

On the surface it looks like a mess—the saga of Beowulf, as told through multiple auctions (?!)—but it manages to hang together.  I rather liked it.

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>A very cool &quot;atmospheric&quot; game, best played at night by candlelight with one of those haunted house records spinning in the background.  Replay value seems high at first glance (50 different scenarios!) but in reality the card text, while chilling the first time around, gets old with later plays.  My advice:  don&#039;t take it seriously (it&#039;s far too random for that) and play it as a party game.  Once a year, on Halloween.  In the dark.

UPDATE:  A total of 11 plays as of November 2013, all of them in darkness and firelight, with that goddamn piloerecting spooky soundtrack—[i]A Night in a Haunted House/A Night in a Graveyard[/i] (1992)—whose sound effects invariably, eerily, line up with the action.  Never playing it during the day or in artificial light makes the whole affair rather... [i]mysterious[/i].  Straining to read cards with a candle in the fist really adds a lot to the proceedings.  Even now, in the happy shine of morning, I feel a vague unease upon catching a glimpse of the box...

[q]Highlights from the last couple years:

• Once the traitor was revealed, he didn&#039;t want to go into the other room to read his plot synopsis.  He was too freaked out—and we&#039;re talking about a grown-ass man here.

• My little dog had worked her way under the table and into the forest of our legs without anyone noticing.  The toll of a bell on the soundtrack made her bark and everyone at the table simultaneously leaped out of their skins and crapped their pants.[/q]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Rating is as a family game—I&#039;m currently using this as &quot;stepping stones to the temple of [i]Tichu[/i]&quot; for my two sons.  So far it&#039;s worked like gangbusters as a short, fun just-before-bedtime family game.  My next scheme is to suck my dad &amp; brother in with penny-a-point games...

Note:  I chuck the deuce-as-top-card nuttiness and just teach it ace-high with &quot;standard&quot; card ranking (and refer to it as [i]Step on the Little Guy[/i] rather than [i]Big Two[/i]).  Clears up a LOT of confusion for newbies this way.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Q:  What if Nanking, Dresden and Hiroshima had an absinthe-fueled ménage à trois—and you and your friends were left to clean up the mess?

A:  You&#039;d get [i]Blue Moon City[/i]!
  
As is usual in Knizia games, you typically want to do just one more thing per turn than you&#039;re allowed, leading to the agony of coming up one move short (or not) for the win.  The overall strategic feel is more parasitic than cooperative—figuring out how best to piggy-back on other people&#039;s hard work.

All our games to date have been very close... this sort of &quot;many-stooges-through-one-doorway-simultaneously&quot; finish makes for a tense (but fun) game.</comment>				</item>

[size=7]Fig. 1 — [i]At Last! A Contrivance to Exorcize the Devil from Idle Hands[/i][/size]

[i]&quot;Gentlemen!  We have discovered the cure for indolence!  Through force of will—and a not inconsiderable amount of Capital—we shall transform the indigent and their natural lassitude into a veritable hive of industrious bees.  Upon their backs we shall become eaters of honey!  And then later we&#039;ll use steam engines to make giant robots, or something.&quot;[/i]

— The Inestimable Percy Brassacks, Esq.
Vice-Consul, [i]His Majesty&#039;s Committee on the Question of the Impecunious[/i], 1789

Finally, a game where orphans can dig coal, shovel whatnot into foundries, and spin cotton as Nature intended!  Much like Mr. Brassack&#039;s &quot;beehive&quot;, the world of the past will crawl into the future on a moving carpet of the unfortunate.  Pick a better uterus next time, kids!

Initial contact was rough, as this comes across as a bog-standard Euro where one grinds nibs to trade for nobs and score dinguses; it was with great joy that I discovered this is really a storytelling game ([i]my favorite kind[/i]), the story of the sprouting and flourishing of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain.  All those little rules, those teeny-tiny rules everyone forgets to hate, make no sense when taken at face value...  They are chrome, or, if you will, the lint and coal dust that gilds the dim windows of the noisome factories.  Without them you could forget that each Pound Sterling you plunk down lands squarely on someone&#039;s bare foot.

I want to play this one to death, to learn its secrets, to see into those dark depths where we trade cash for self-respect.  I [i]love[/i] it.

[i]&quot;We call the li&#039;l one &#039;Niney&#039;, what that &#039;e&#039;s only got nine fingers.  Well, most of &#039;em do—but that one there&#039;s ol&#039; Niney anyways.&quot;[/i]

You can&#039;t just point a foam rubber gun at someone and say &quot;Tee-hee!  I will shoot you&quot; and expect to get anything done.

You have to jam it in their eye and scream:

[o]&quot;I will [i]fucking do you[/i], right here, right now—and then I&#039;ll do your [i]whole fucking family[/i], skin your kids and [i]whip your pets to death[/i] with their wet, knotted hides and then I&#039;ll do myself so we can all meet at my pleasure dome in the afterlife where [i]you are all my slaves[/i] and then I&#039;ll do you all again and so on forever unless you [i]drop.  The fucking.  Gun![/i]  Do it!  [i]Do it now![/i]&quot;[/o]
My kids will never, ever see me play this game.

Investigators form up into teams and pile into stories and you just have to hope that enough of them survive to get some work done.  For the Mythos player, it&#039;s about meeting the Investigators halfway with a couple of really awful monsters to drive them insane and eat the leftovers.  A fun little diversion, but I just can&#039;t bring myself to get on the CCG whirligig again.  [i]Ever[/i].

Score reflects play with unmodified starter decks.

UPDATE:  FFG has released a &quot;Premium Starter Set&quot; with two pre-constructed decks.  This is THE way to play for those of us paralyzed by CCGophobia.  Recommended.

	<numplays>27</numplays>			<comment>[b]tl;dr[/b] — Potentially light and mild, it&#039;s a great social game when played in 30ish minutes, but sags if it goes longer.  Expansions are the seasoning and so should be used sparingly to create the game that suits your current mood.  Terribly cruel when played to win, though.

[microbadge=10153]

Neat for what it is, a kids&#039; game that can be played for blood (farm wars, anyone?).  The vanilla version is a pleasant-enough pastime.  Where [i]Carc[/i] really shines, though, is as a game system—the mix &#039;n match expansions allow you to complicate or flavor the game as you will.

UPDATE:  Revising down from a 7 to a 6.  This was shockingly novel at first, being only the second Eurogame I&#039;d ever seen, but now...  And another thing:  The 8,000,000,000 different farm-scoring schema make for bizarre parallel-dimension gaming where some people at the table have evil goatees and some don&#039;t, leading to the disastrous overlay of competing realities, some where farmers lie on their backs and gaze at duck-shaped clouds scudding by and others where you can only get promoted by stabbing your boss in the neck.*

UP-UPDATE:  This is the game that made me realize that most expansions are crap—they just add plaque that calcifies a decent game into an immobile, spiky mess.  (Or, to go to the other extreme, bloats it out so it can&#039;t even wear pants anymore.)   Expansions, in general, are a terrible idea unless:

a) It was a part of the original game (as designed) that got peeled off to make the base game simpler/cheaper,

b) Actually adds an element that enhances repeat plays, or

c) Fixes one or more broken elements that really shoulda been caught during playtesting.

Only three expansions for [i]Carc[/i] fit any of that—[thing=2591]The River[/thing], [thing=2993]Inns &amp; Cathedrals[/thing] and [thing=5405]Traders &amp; Builders[/thing].  Everything else is dessicated mummy-crap.

UP-UP-UPDATE:  Resurrecting this as a mild social activity; as a [i]game[/i] game it gets a 5, when consumed as a small bowl of whipped cream it&#039;s a 6.  The deal with the expansions is to understand that every tile added into the mix is another turn—and if you&#039;ve got multiple axes to consider (with several expansions at once) then those turns can become very long indeed.  The game works best when it comes in well under an hour; it [i]wants[/i] to be short.**  I can honestly only see using one expansion at a time...

I forgot what an awful little game this can be:  so much grief, so many ambitious building projects that will never be completed, so many farmers stabbing each other in the tummy with pitchforks from the backs of rage-donkeys.

I&#039;m not sure how the rest of world plays this, but man, we are just plain [i]mean[/i] to each other.

[i]Me likey.[/i]

UP-UP-UP-UPDATE:  Back up to a 7 where I expect it to stay.  When grokked and played accordingly—as a shortish social activity with one big and maaaybe one small expansion at a time it&#039;s a pip.

[b]CODA:  GROINS IMPLY BOOTS[/b]

The sheer ruthlessness required to play the game competitively is entirely at odds with the presentation:  cutesy li&#039;l squares of bucolic cartoons, and the meeples themselves, adorable and nonthreatening, the very symbols of &quot;points without pain&quot; Eurogaming.  If the package reflected the truth of it the art would be dark and violent:  fields strewn with fresh grave-mounds, dangerous roads to nowhere festering with spleen-stabbing thieves, sprawling slums with gaping holes in the walls patrolled by gangs of baby-stomping kingsmen.

This is what you must do to win:  sucker your opponents into fights that you either dominate or walk away from (leaving them overextended), place tiles to ensure their followers are trapped in projects that will never be completed, and never share points unless you are so far ahead it doesn&#039;t matter... and even then, hook yourself in for +1 at the last minute to steal the &quot;joint effort&quot; for yourself.

You must crush dreams, snap their bones and suck the marrow.  You must be prepared to engineer fallen crests and hopelessness.  I&#039;ll be honest:  I felt like a complete jerk at first, as playing to win in [i]Carc[/i] is really about [i]making everyone else lose[/i], and the constant pooping in the punchbowl can suck the fun right out of the party.  But if you wish to do your best then that tile [i]must[/i] be placed where it maximizes both personal gain [i]and[/i] does the most harm to your opponents.

In the end the countryside puzzle we are constructing is a façade that does nothing to conceal the suffering of the nameless, numberless peasants who are too small to see from our lofty perches of intrigue.

[size=7]*So, 12 years later, it looks like this has settled down—the standard seems to be German 3rd Edition rules with &quot;farm-centric&quot; scoring of cities for three points each.  I like the simplification—as well as the change making the tiny two-bit mini-cities worth four points instead of two, eliminating a rules exception, always a good thing.

[thing=2993]Inns &amp; Cathedrals[/thing] is pretty much essential (I can&#039;t see ever playing without it) and we haven&#039;t really gotten into [thing=5405]Traders &amp; Builders[/thing] yet—but the mini-expansions should work nicely as single pinches of spice to season the game to the table&#039;s taste.

After years of no love, revisiting this as a mild social activity...  I&#039;d like to try my many unplayed expansions one at a time to get a feel for what they do.  (I get the impression that &quot;MegaCarc&quot; is just too much, like eating seven-and-a-half jelly donuts while doing Jäger shots.  One of either is more than enough.)  But we shall see.

All plays collected under [gameid=822].

UPDATE:  Every added tile is another turn; most people can squeeze out two turns per minute if they play in a timely fashion.  Of course, the more critical the turn (especially in the later game) and the more axes of consideration (if considering the effects of multiple expansions) the longer this gets—and let&#039;s be honest:  

The experience and outcome just plain do not warrant that level of ponder.

UP-UPDATE:  One of the cruelest little games I own, a Hello Kitty stiletto.  Definitely a timeless keeper.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>[b]Adds 24 tiles = 24 turns = 15 minutes +++[/b]

[i](Plusses are for the added time spent considering the three new elements:  trade goods, pigs &amp; builders.)[/i]

Which expansions, you ask?  This one, [thing=2591]The River[/thing], and [thing=2993]Inns &amp; Cathedrals[/thing].  The rest are gimmicky, counter-intuitive crap.

PS.  &quot;The Sack&quot; is worth the price of admission alone as it converts the metaphorical teabagging the game provides into a literal one.

UPDATE:  This is really three modules that synergize well together—city tiles that grant trade goods, pigs to make the resulting city-rich farms worth more, and builders to grant extra turns to sneak into or steal features—but can be teased apart as you will.

Pigs &amp; builders can be dropped into any game with ease.

Also:  Trade good tiles work well with [thing=12903]The Count[/thing], providing an extra incentive to &quot;help&quot; others complete cities in order to not only get the goods, but to stage a meeple in Carcassonne proper for later punch-bowl-poopin&#039; deployment...

The art in [i]Hunters[/i] is fussy and indistinct; instead of ending up with a map of the game at the end, you get a big, blurry scribble.  Call me shallow, call me the-toothpick-counting-guy-who-buys-his-underwear-at-Kmart...  but I found the art far too distracting to enjoy the game.  For multiplayer I far and away prefer real [i]Carc[/i] to this.  If you&#039;re stuck with two players, [i]The Castle[/i] is the best of the series.</comment>				</item>

Which expansions, you ask?  This one, [thing=2591]The River[/thing], and [thing=5405]Traders &amp; Builders[/thing].  The rest are gimmicky, counter-intuitive crap.

The point tiles are nice for taunting, though the sixth player is waaay too much.  It&#039;s cool to have a different color, but after two games at 6p I&#039;m pretty much done with &quot;full boat&quot; [i]Carc[/i].

UPDATE:  I really like what this does.  The all-or-nothing gamble of the eponymous tiles adds a neat way to blow out some massive points on your side while prolapsing the bowels of your opponents on the other:

&quot;Here—&quot; [drops cathedral into the outskirts of an unfinished megalopolis near game end] &quot;—the Pope says you [i]totally[/i] got this.&quot;

UP-UPDATE:  Can&#039;t ever see playing [i]Carc[/i] without this—the base game alone feels incomplete in comparison.  It&#039;s the must-have, always-mixed-in keeper.

Besides, there&#039;s never a reason not to include the acromegalic BOSS MEEPLES in all games of [i]Carc[/i] from this moment forward, [i]forever[/i].

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Good stuff in that it causes massive-project competition, though once the top-end threshold is reached there&#039;s really no stealing the titles away.  Which I suppose is thematic; once your butt&#039;s in the seat you&#039;re gonna neck-stab everyone who has the same idea...

Has nice synergy with [thing=12903]The Count[/thing] as it gives everyone yet another reason to &quot;cooperate&quot; and complete features for each other.

It&#039;s also nifty in that it adds features to the tableau that other players can monkey around with.

And then they Scrooge-McDuck around with it, making really heavy, unstable pigsties and pressing peasants to death with stacks of ingots.

UPDATE:  Gold is heavy—[i]monstrously heavy[/i]—and when lifted can cause disastrous, spandex-shredding blowouts.  While bowels in your pants is certainly de rigueur for [i]Carc[/i], it&#039;s as hard on the eyes as it is the stomach.

&quot;I don&#039;t like gold,&quot; said Anna.

And she was the runaway winner, by something like 80 points.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>[c]disks --&gt; chits --&gt; cards[/c]

Bid disks to buy sets of chits and trade them in for victory point cards. 

Mildly intriguing auction &amp; set collection that requires intensive screwage to prevent runaway scoring. The moment someone doesn&#039;t use their turn to check their right-hand neighbor that player gains advantage and everyone else starts to lose. So you either play like massive dicks or let someone run away with it.

The underlying math is nifty—casual sets will almost always add up to one fewer than you need to purchase the next VP card.

It&#039;s mercifully short, though I&#039;m not sure how it&#039;s supposed to be a family game unless such things usually involve tears.

UPDATE:  Okay, so one more play, this time without the vicious cycle of openhand slapping, e.g., everyone constantly raising their right-hand neighbor to prevent runaway progress, the lack of which changes it from a brawl to a race.  This is probably closer to what the designer intended, as the vindictive bid-fights just made the game bitter.

Never-ending bid fights:  low-scoring fight game with lots of retracted bids, making Syndicate cards very worthwhile.

No anal neighbor-checking:  high-scoring race game with less profanity.

There&#039;s probably a happy medium, but I have my doubts we&#039;ll ever find it. 

UP-UPDATE:  Is this really an auction game?  The bidding is resolved in super slo-mo—I slap down some coins, then I have to wait until my next turn to see if I won, or to increase the bid if I didn&#039;t.  Then another turn to see how that pans out.  And if you &amp; I get into a bid fight we can easily piss away [i]a third of the entire game[/i] over a single &quot;auction&quot;!  So, no, bid-fighting is just stupid.

After group discussion we settled on this game really being about appraising lots and offering to pay just a little bit more than it&#039;s worth to scare everyone else off.  If you undervalue it, you&#039;ll have someone come over the top and then it&#039;s probably best to wave off instead of sticking in and putting those resources out of the game for the bulk of the session.  If you overvalue it you&#039;re spending out inefficiently and will lose the game to someone who shaves it just a hair closer.  The goal is to &quot;Baby Bear&quot; it and get it juuust right so no one else wants to spend the extra +1 coin yet you end up paying an efficient minimum for it.

Don&#039;t let all the thought and discussion fool you—[i]I hate this game.[/i]

Honest.

:shake:

UP-UP-UPDATE:  Final score—110, 110, 105.  Guess who got 105?

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>One play with four.  Here&#039;s what I got out of it:

• &quot;Pigs&quot; are actually naked, shaved townsfolk crawling around on all fours squealing like piggies.  Still good eatin&#039;, though.

• The Haunted Mansion has two mysterious poofs.

• There is no mechanism to determine which aristocrat loses his or her nose to syphilis; but then I&#039;m probably confusing this with [i]The Cankers of Burgundy[/i].

More comments:

[q=&quot;HiveGod&quot;]I dunno.  It hits me like [i]Carcassonne[/i] with dice, but not really dice since there&#039;s no bell curve and you can adjust the pips up or down with workers.  So it&#039;s really just a genteel eggshell-walkin&#039; [i]Carc[/i] where everyone engages in lonely parallel play like a bunch of four-year-olds at the sand table.

Here&#039;s an example of the heated player interaction that can happen:

Player A:  [thinking]  [i]Man, I can&#039;t wait to pick chickens.[/i]

Player B:  [picks chickens]

Player A:  Goddammit!

Also, is &quot;shipping pink&quot; a euphemism for something unsavory?*

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>OH GOD THE SIMPLE ART, THE THIN CARDBOARD IT&#039;S ALL SO...  SO...

[i]Perfectly sufficient.[/i]

If the art were busier it&#039;d be harder to suss out the relevant info on each tile; if the card were thicker nothing would shuffle or stack neatly.  Was it done on the cheap?  I dunno—but it all works [i]beautifully[/i].  Nothing in the entire experience—visual, tactile or otherwise—felt &quot;less-than&quot;.

[b]10 plays later:[/b]  7 --&gt; 8  The game gets crazy-tight when played with experienced people who know what they&#039;re doing.  Definitely gets the bump when everyone knows how to properly value rooms based on relative player positions, seating order, and ever-morphing groupthink.

Speaking of which, the orginal art is more than sufficient—it&#039;s necessary.  To play competitively you need to be able to take in your opponents&#039; castles at a glance from across the table in questionable lighting—[i]how many pink rooms does she have?  How many food rooms are in play, and where?[/i]  And so on.  Doing this without squinting, or asking (which gives the game away), or [i]getting it wrong[/i] is one of the keys to winning.  The original art facilitates this brilliantly.

I love the meta that the completion reward for Sleeping rooms is the one that grinds the game to an utter halt.  Really puts the &quot;AP&quot; in &quot;nap time&quot;.

Yeah, you know that by now.  You have six dice with the usual resources on them—wood, brick, wheat, sheep, ore &amp; gold—and you get three rolls, banking and re-rolling as you will, in order to build the usual roads, knights, settlements &amp; cities to score.  Two golds act as a wild.  The edge of irritation comes at the ten-minute mark; that would seem to limit it to two or three players max.  It&#039;s also not awful as a solo, semi-masturbatory time-waster for high score.  Should you run out and buy it?  Probably not.  I&#039;m not sorry I have it, but if I&#039;d played it first I probably would have passed on it.

In the end it&#039;s all the [i]Catan[/i] theme with none of the meat; or, as if Klaus blew up a [i]Catan[/i] party balloon and now you get to deflate it into your mouth and get a good taste of his breath, all damp and lung-y with a hint of schnitzel and beer.  Good schnitzel and beer, but still.

UPDATE:  Okay, all the above makes it sound like I don&#039;t like it, and I actually do.  The wife enjoys it, I enjoy playing with her, so I&#039;m bumping it up to a 7.

UPDATE:  After four &quot;learning&quot; games—separated by enough time to make the rules hazy, and with different players at each session—it&#039;s clear to me that this is only going to shine with complete knowledge of the various powers, and especially the contents of their decks.

On the one hand this suggests a huge amount of replay value—it would take at least four plays (once as each power) just to get to the starting point of deeper understanding—but in reality it&#039;s going to be difficult to string together connected plays with the same people in a culture where very few are interested in wearing a game out.

But I love the idea of this, the mythos and presentation, and so I must try...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Classic, unapologetic Ameritrash:  theme as king, experience as a mirror to theme, and massive amounts of random ass-stabbing.

Really nails it if you can get into being a furious Ork general standing on a rock outcropping screaming orders at your stupid, milling troops.  Form them up into lines as quickly as possible to send them smashing into your rivals&#039; formations before they do the same to you.

It&#039;s purely random, with small decisions here and there, mostly of the &quot;Whose ass do I stab now?&quot; variety.  (Hint:  whoever stabbed you last, or, failing that, whoever&#039;s weakest at the moment.)

There is an entire, overwrought game world in this box—each card has a background story and a fistful of rules (with numerous exceptions) to boot.  While some may see this as a negative (and I found it daunting at first) the complexity is really thick plates of chrome and story that enhance the experience once you get it down.

It&#039;s all about Orky crotch-kicking, and then pointing and laughing.  If this doesn&#039;t sound like fun, then stay away—you&#039;d probably just end up getting your spreadsheet-clickin&#039; finger broken.

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>[i]Kill Hitler, end the Universe.[/i]

UPDATE:  For best results, treat this as a storytelling party game for history nerds where Linchpins can only be flipped [i]in person[/i].  Take the typical chrono-chaos surrounding &quot;1963:  Kennedy Assassinated&quot; for example:

[q=&quot;wibbily wobbly timey wimey stuff&quot;][microbadge=18768] [i]Just as &quot;Oswald&quot; draws a bead on the President&#039;s head a time traveler steps out from behind a strange curve and brains the shooter with a tomahawk—

[microbadge=18768] As &quot;Jackie&quot; suddenly pulls a switchblade and stabs Kennedy in the neck—

[microbadge=18768] As &quot;Connally&quot; turns in the front seat and unloads a Model 642 Centennial Airweight .38 Special +P into &quot;her&quot; face, peeling &quot;her&quot; pink pillbox—

[microbadge=18768] As &quot;Abraham Zapruder&quot; takes a knee on the grassy knoll and pops a goddamn RPG straight into the 1962 grille of the custom 1961 Lincoln Continental, blowing it to smithereens— 

[microbadge=18768] As a careening [/i][c][nondescript][/c][i] garbage truck gets air off the knoll, pulping the would-be rocketeer—

[microbadge=18768] As a guy with a limpet mine (originally intended for the re-sinking of the [/i]Titanic[i]) bolts from the crowd and clamps it to the side of the rapidly recombobulating limo—

[microbadge=18768] As we all suddenly discover that limpet mine guy&#039;s mom was his dad while his [/i]dad[i] dad was still his dad and so he cancels out like some kind of pesky denominator—

[microbadge=18768] As a Fairchild FH-227D full of Jesuit proto-cannibals makes a sudden detour from 1972 and nosedives into the scene in an obliterating cone of fire—[/i][/q]
And so Dealey Plaza becomes an ever-widening stutter of doings and undoings, up to and including the probable detonation of the Sun itself.

Time travel, you see, is not for the faint of heart—it requires real grit and the kind of single-focus determination one would imagine necessary for [i]continual mass suicide[/i].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Only really necessary if you play this game an awful lot, and love it accordingly.  The wooden king piece is nice, but I already had a weighted Staunton king that I spray-painted gold and accessorized with purple felt...  The replacement cards are nice, but I already keep &#039;em in sleeves...  So, in the final analysis, all I really get are the new district cards.

I have to say, in all seriousness, my favorite part of this expansion is the box.  It&#039;s much smaller than the original and has a nice linen finish AND IT HOLDS THE ENTIRE GAME!!!  At last, I have a nice box that matches the form-factor of the game itself.

PURGED as redundant since acquiring the 2005 FFG Silver Line edition of the base game with the expansion included.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>A mish-mash of mechanics (set collection cardplay, blind bidding, and a teensy bit of [i]Tetris[/i], among others) held together by an engaging theme and over-the-top production values.  It really shouldn&#039;t work, but when played as a lighter, almost party-style game (i.e., social above all) it works brilliantly.

Corruption is the fastest way to victory points—and into the crocodile&#039;s gullet!  For me the most engaging part of the game is the balance between greed (racing ahead via corruption) and trying to position yourself just enough to eke out a win.  You don&#039;t need to be the least corrupt or the richest to win—you just need to be one unit less corrupt than the worst player and a single Talent ahead of everyone who&#039;s left.  Really feels like walking a tightrope over a croc pit.

I hesitate to recommend it as YMMV, but around here it&#039;s worked great as a couples&#039; game.</comment>				</item>

UPDATE:  What&#039;s not to love?  The theme is rock-solid, the trappings are keen, and it&#039;s usually over before you know it.  As a role-playing party game, it doesn&#039;t get much better than this.  Use 2d6 for movement and it should take no more than 30 minutes, tops.  (Or ditch the dice and go &quot;commando&quot;.)  And if you don&#039;t love the feeling you get when you deduce the answer it&#039;s because you&#039;ve never experienced it.  It&#039;s like having x-ray vision and one of those four-hour erections they&#039;re always talking about on TV—SIMULTANEOUSLY!!!

PS.  The 1972 edition (the first one to use photos) is the only way to go.

[b]EDITIONS OWNED:[/b]

[b]1979 (1972) with the photographs[/b] 
:star::star::star::star::nostar:
Has the most authentic &quot;Agatha Christie/murder mystery&quot; feel.

[b]1996 with painted art[/b] 
:star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
The art gets an early &#039;90s style upgrade.  Not bad.

[b][gameid=4928][/b]
:star::star::star::halfstar::nostar:
Very slick, very nice set.  My second favorite to play with.

[b]2005 cartoony Art Deco[/b] 
:star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
Ditched the box and tossed it all in with the camping gear.  The disposable &quot;muddy thumbprint&quot; edition.

[b][gameid=1663][/b]
:star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
Kind of lame.  The D&amp;D skin is stretched to breaking across the Clue skeleton.</comment>				</item>

UPDATE:  Okay, in all honesty, [i]Clue[/i] is not one of those games that works well with reskinning.  The original is built up from a solid foundation of Agatha Christie-style shenanigans.  It works best when we&#039;re all running around a baroque mansion accusing each other of bludgeoning, strangling, stabbing or shooting Old Man Boddy... probably for his money.  The whole [i]D&amp;D[/i] thing just doesn&#039;t work.  I&#039;d much rather play the &#039;70s version with the photographs.

UP-UPDATE:  Now that the kids are adults, the game is over in a flash—everyone pretty much hits the solution simultaneously and then it&#039;s a race to the center...  Also, I&#039;ve come to appreciate the [i]D&amp;D[/i] flavor as the sparkle-frosting on the pinky-pink cupcake.

Rating could go up or down with more play.

UPDATE:  Rating up from 7 to 8.  It&#039;s on the lighter side of tense, but that tension can be exquisite at times.  And it&#039;s always good when the other guy&#039;s Master Spy gets torn to pieces in a riot.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Utility note:  I originally had this (and [i]Greece &amp; Eastern Kingdoms[/i]) in tackle boxes like you see in the image gallery, but once we actually started playing I bagged everything.  Bags are really much more convenient for storage, setup and breakdown. 

[microbadge=619]

(Upgraded with the [gameid=138441] &amp; two sets of Valley Games&#039; replacement wooden dice—[i]very nice.[/i]  Also threw in a bunch of red glass beads to act as unit activation markers.)*

[imageid=154488 small]

[size=18][b]*[/b][/size]

[size=7]Mounted board:  I was perfectly cool with the one that came with the game, as it felt appropriately thematic to have a &quot;paper&quot; map to go with the wooden blocks, but repeat plays highlighted the negatives—too easy to bump and move, and it wouldn&#039;t lay flat, causing terrain to slip around.  (A plexiglass sheet, while utilitarian, broke the &quot;pre-battle strategy session in a sandy tent&quot; feel for me, and I&#039;m a pig for thematic immersion.)  The mounted board is much, much nicer.

Wooden dice:  The plastic dice that come with the game are just plain godawful.  For ancients warfare I want a [i]wood-paper-stone[/i] experience—not the [i]touched-a-bug[/i] sensation of Chinese polymers.  Curiously, one set of these has matte ink for all faces except the leader while the other set is apparently done up in &quot;disco blaze&quot; with sparkly ink for all unit faces.[/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Surprisingly deep when you factor in all of the possible player interaction (shifting alliances, etc.) with the boat-loads of strategic and tactical options.  VERY nice Machiavellian feel.  &quot;Is it better to be loved or feared?&quot;  (Best when played with the &quot;capturing cities&quot; rule and at least 5 players, though 6 is best.)  

UPDATE IN RESPONSE TO NEGATIVE COMMENTS:  This is not a card game—it is a game of negotiation, alliances, and backstabbing.  If you play by yourself, for yourself, you&#039;re missing half of what should be going on here.  Dealt a bad hand?  Two people pulling ahead?  Form an alliance for protection.  Make it 2 against 4.  Hand whole cities over to each other... or get your &quot;ally&quot; to overextend so you can cut him off at the knees.  The card-battle mechanism is very much a sideshow to a vibrant and boisterous game of bluff, counter-bluff, rope-a-dope and intrigue.  It&#039;s Diplomacy lite with an extra helping of whipped cream.

UP-UPDATE:  Okay, I lied—the &quot;capturing cities&quot; rule just makes the game go on forever.  Much better to play it straight where captured cities are permanent.  Makes each battle mean that much more and gets the whole thing over with inside an hour.

Moderate (read: easy) look-ahead combined with just a smidgen of planning, this game works great with younger kids.  As with most games like this they&#039;ll outgrow it pretty quickly—but in the meantime their brains will swell &amp; pulse with incredible power…

Bluffing, gambling, negotiation, backstabbing, outrageous reversals—this game has it all.  And a thick, gooey science fiction theme to boot!  The rules are simple, almost laughably so, but that&#039;s not where the game is.  The game is in finding the most clever way in which to use those rules to your advantage, no matter how bleak the situation.  Taken at face value, it&#039;s pretty lame, and I can see why some people hate it so.  Add in a bunch of raucous, cunning friends and the game surprises and delights every time.  I&#039;m constantly surprised at some of the subtle ways &quot;I&#039;m screwed&quot; moments can turn into a big win.

Negotiated (or even forced) multi-wins are great since they keep the playing time more than tolerable (read: occasionally [i]too[/i] short—but what the hell, let&#039;s play again!).

(Includes all expansions through [i]Dominion[/i].)

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Played our first seven-player (!) game of this with the &quot;large group&quot; cards mixed into the deck—[i]fantastic experience.[/i]  The extra cards were necessary as I think the deck would have been too thin without them.  Even with the extras we very nearly had the entire thing dealt out at one point.  So, big plus for the extra cards.

We will be ignoring the team rules... they just don&#039;t look very interesting.

(Even though we&#039;ve thrown all the new aliens into the mix, I will only be counting this expansion as played when we use the &quot;[b]large group[/b]&quot; cards for 7-8 player games.)</comment>				</item>

With all expansions including this one packed in there I think we&#039;re pretty much set for more possible games than could ever be played, even in a transhuman/post-singularity &quot;lifetime&quot; where the thing that thinks it&#039;s me is like three viruses infecting an immortal pack of robochimps—[i]forever[/i].

Pretty sure this game doesn&#039;t &quot;need&quot; anything else! 

(Even though we&#039;ve thrown all the new aliens into the mix, I will only be counting this expansion as played when we use the [b]Reward deck[/b] or [b]Special Ships[/b] options.)</comment>				</item>

Has some nice synergy with [thing=7707]The King[/thing] as the person completing the largest city or longest road becomes King or Robber Baron (not the one scoring it), providing an extra incentive for nonscoring completions, the trigger for consigning a meeple into the Count&#039;s &quot;care&quot;.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Preliminary rating after two sessions (10ish games?)—as it&#039;s tiny, plays up to 6, and quickly, too.  Oh, yeah—and it&#039;s pretty nifty.  You instantaneously recognize fatal errors as soon as they leave your mouth, with no chance to bite them back...  But what the hell—reset and get your revenge in the next round!

A great filler that should be standard equipment in every game night go-bag.

(I&#039;ll be recording each session—multiple games—as a single play.)

(Best when played as a &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot;.)

Yeah, it&#039;s a stitched-together Frankenbeast agglomerated from the parts of other games:  [GAMEID=2952], [GAMEID=5122], [GAMEID=2281], [GAMEID=550], various word games, etc., but that just means that everyone can find something they&#039;re better at than everyone else.  It also allows for varying levels of interaction (or inebriation)—a key feature for both imbibers and designated drivers.  If you remember that this is less about the game on the table and more about about the friends around the table, it&#039;s hard not to have a good time.  Fun murderers, or groups with one, should probably wave off and go play something more serious like [GAMEID=822].

Lucky for me, my group likes snorting drinks through their noses, making the little people-pieces hump each other, and laughing until their tummies hurt.  We wore out the original Cranium and two booster boxes, and, just last night, looped all the cards in the WOW edition...  Unfortunately, the people I game with are sharp enough to not only remember getting a certain card [i]months ago[/i] but they can also remember what someone did (or didn&#039;t do) [i]specifically[/i] in the attempt to win that card for their team.  Sometimes I wish I gamed with dumb people... I know I&#039;d win more.

Booster boxes, anyone?  Please?

UPDATE:  We&#039;re on our fourth edition of this, having burned through three others and both booster boxes.  I guess you could say this works for us.

UP-UPDATE:  WARNING—MAY CAUSE HEADACHE, CHEEK-ACHE AND RIB-ACHE

&quot;Oh god, [i]stop[/i]—I have a headache from laughing!&quot;

&quot;What?  You [i]knew[/i] this was the laugh-headache game when you sat down—sack up and play!&quot;</comment>				</item>

UPDATE:  A not-bad warm up party game, but there really aren&#039;t enough cards to give this one any longevity.  I suppose if you could all agree to drink blackout levels of alcohol or sustain head injuries between sessions is could work.  Or you could play with the slightly stupid.

Also, you&#039;re under 30 and aren&#039;t a music geek you&#039;re gonna spend a lot of time letting the team down.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Great family game.  Seeing what everyone picked for you is like Christmas morning—my wife felt especially loved when our two boys, a nephew, and I made her ranking of selections particularly difficult; we all picked things she enjoyed, every time.  That&#039;s when she knew how well we knew her, and how much attention we pay to her likes and dislikes.

Awright—that&#039;s enough sap.

The game can be learned in 4.3 blimfarks (that&#039;s really, [i]really[/i] fast) and doesn&#039;t last as long as you wish it would.  Calls of &quot;let&#039;s play again!&quot; are not uncommon.  Recommended for families.</comment>				</item>

This game is all about the group.  Large group of married extroverts = good game.  Smaller group of self-conscious singles = terrible game.

UPDATE:  Get [gameid=4424] instead.

UP-UPDATE:  After wearing out the base game and two booster boxes, we&#039;re back in the saddle with [gameid=33150].  We love it!

UP-UP-UPDATE:  We just looped all the cards in the WOW edition and the people I game with are sharp enough that they not only remember getting a certain card [i]years ago[/i] but they can also remember what someone did (or didn&#039;t do) [i]specifically[/i] to attempt to win that card for their team.  Sometimes I wish I gamed with dumb people... I know I&#039;d win more.

Booster boxes, anyone?</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>A decent-enough light party game.  Think of it as advanced [i]Uno[/i] with more to do than simply pitch cards.  You get to match or complete sets, spell rude words, add card values to make 11... all with the wee-est bit of &quot;take that&quot; thrown in to keep the game spiny.  Works best as a super-short family game before bedtime.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[b]WARNING:[/b]  This is, at its heart, a dice game.  Much of the &quot;action&quot; comes in the form of &quot;passing tests&quot; which are nothing more than you and an opponent engaging in brainless card-play and then rolling D6s to see who gets the highest number.  If this in any way bothers you, you will hate this game.  Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It&#039;s a terrific light filler (game length is adjustable) for Cthulhu fans, slathered to dripping in theme.  The humor is silly, and really, what more can you ask of humor?  I lost horribly in my first game—the only lap counter I got was from stealing an opponent&#039;s Gremlin-infested Engine of the Damned and taking a short-cut through the Dreamlands while drunk out of my mind on Space Mead.  If that sentence gets you off, so will this game.</comment>				</item>

♪ [i]When you&#039;re a priest of Cthulhu you&#039;re not a priest of Cthulhu for long![/i] ♫

:goo:

Another deeply misunderstood social interaction coupling device from Steve Jackson Games.  At face value it&#039;s Mythos [gameid=3522]; but the social game, played in good humor with good friends, is a fun-enough (brief) time waster &amp; chuckle generator.  The game resides in the choosing of the victim and the deflection and re-targeting of that choice.  Bringing in outside elements and arguments adds a great deal to the proceedings:  &quot;I will give you the cherry on top of my milkshake if you zortch [i]him[/i] instead of me—besides, he&#039;s always late to the rituals and his robes reek of urine.&quot;

This is one for the RPG crowd, the Con crowd, those who can ham it up and get into the gleeful grinding of axes.  It&#039;s not for those who are unable or unwilling to argue colorfully on their own behalf to the amusement of friends.

The game isn&#039;t in the package—it&#039;s in [i]you[/i].*

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Man, I really want to like this one.

One member of our game group had a very bad experience with this and shared his pain with the rest of us; it&#039;s gonna be really hard to convince anyone to give this another shot...

The one time I did manage to get a three-player game it was marred by too few players and the fact that the other two were absolutely not into it.  Suck, suck &amp; suck.

Hopefully I can turn this around at some point.

UPDATE:  After playing an actual game of this with three enthusiastic delvers and one veteran (thanks, Josh!) all I can say is that the well-poisoner who hated on it was smokin&#039; wack.  Even Anna, who stated up front that she&#039;s not a fan of &quot;backstabby&quot; games, was smitten.

There is a delicious tension in the competitive co-op; in the first room we ran into the Ripper and spent a good deal of time screwing around before the deathblow fell.  In the second room we met the dread Hydra, and after doing the calculations of multi-headed attacks vs. our remaining life points we realized that we couldn&#039;t afford to goof off at all—it would take an all-out joint effort just to keep the party alive.

Truly, truly the game requires an [i]intelligent[/i] balance between take-that backstabbery and co-op play—monkey around too much and everyone dies.  One must think of one&#039;s comrades as tools to get you to the finalish rooms, perhaps a bit beat up, before going whole hog with the betrayal...

Add to that more of the Good Stuff (cards for every deck) and a box with bespoke insert that holds the entire game to date (base + all four expansions) neatly, perfectly...

Makes me feel like the monkey who caught a swung femur to the brainpan and amid the white light and buzz is rewarded with a glimpse of the gates of Heaven boiling open.

[i]&quot;After we shoot the squatters in the McDonald&#039;s we&#039;ll drink the fryer grease.  Well, me &#039;n you will anyway—screw those other guys.&quot;[/i]

[COLOR=#66CCFF][size=18]*[/size][/COLOR]
First play was rough, as I was the betrayer (dammit!) and had no idea how to nudge things in the desired direction without looking fishy.  Providence lent me a hand with a disastrous &quot;hospital adventure&quot; in which two survivors perished (a vivid and memorable narrative moment), but after I dumped the first real turd in the punch bowl my poker face slipped and I was caught in a lie, summarily exiled, my objective rendered impossible.  Next time will be different... right?

[imageid=2266458 original]
Some crossroads cards are marked with a li&#039;l swearing word-balloon to indicate &quot;mature content&quot;, facilitating their removal for those who&#039;d rather not endure potentially disturbing material.*  This is a neat idea in general (&quot;Hey!  I can play this with the kids, and Gramma!&quot;) but the application seems haphazard.  The cards with the symbol aren&#039;t [i]that[/i] rugged,

[o]Why can&#039;t we have a debate about [i]smothering[/i] the baby?[/o]
and at least one card that wasn&#039;t marked has a truly horrific encounter with 

[o][i]your dead parents[/i]—one by apparent suicide, the other zombified and coming straight at you.[/o]
If I were lily-livered and that one popped up in front of kids I&#039;d probably faint.  A note to the designers:  If you&#039;re gonna go for the jugular, get to it.  Hesitation marks evoke the wrong kind of disquiet.

UPDATE:  After 4 plays, this gets a 7.  While the narrative moments are grand (last night we decided that exiles get their arms duct-taped to their sides, with a police whistle affixed to their mouths**—they get a boot in the back to send them staggering into the icy night, all a-whistlin&#039; to beat the band) there just doesn&#039;t seem to be much tension.  Betrayers haven&#039;t been at all difficult to spot, and we&#039;ve taken to exiling good people just to get the numbers down to beat a crisis or meet food requirements toward the end.  Hopefully this picks up with experience, but so far the few bright spots have been awash in a sea of ennui.


[size=7]*Seems ludicrous in a seriously-toned game about rooting around in the putrefying corpse of civilization while screwing each other over, but whatever.

**Because we were fresh out of air horns.[/size]

	<numplays>28</numplays>			<comment>Indiana Jones does Vegas.  The ruleset is simple, robust, and can be grasped in under a minute.  Simultaneous play makes it go fast and smooth regardless of the number of players (up to eight).  If  you got a hankerin&#039; for gettin&#039; yer gamble on, you can&#039;t go wrong with this one—to get any better it would have to have Nazi-punching and showgirls.  Or some kind of mutant combo of the two.  Best as a party-style light filler or night ender.  Recommended.  </comment>				</item>

I absolutely [i]love[/i] the open-ended nature of the Storyteller&#039;s role—your &quot;clue&quot; can be [i]anything[/i]:  a word, phrase, sentence or full-blown tale; a poem, song, or hummed tune; or even just sound effects, hand gestures and/or facial expressions!  Boring people kill this game, causing it to slump and die of ennui.  Only sideways-thinking, risk-taking entertainers need apply.

I will play this at the drop of a beret.

Also in the box:

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>While the King&#039;s away the Dukes will... FIGHT!!!  Played this 2-player with a non-gamer who, of course, had never experienced a German-style game.  As soon as we finished, he demanded to play again immediately!  It took us about an hour per game but we didn&#039;t notice until we looked at the clock when we were finished.  It&#039;s that good.

	<numplays>48</numplays>			<comment>A mechanical kick in the pants.  Draft cards to build an efficiency engine to hit the magical 8+ coins per hand and then start buying the big victory points... the rub being that once you start buying VPs they will clog up your machine and make it run all choppy.

Other than committing to a strategy the game really comes down to timing the switch from deck building to buying VPs.  Come in too soon and you bloat the machine with crap.  Come in too late and you&#039;re behind the curve and will lose, maddeningly, by something as stupid as a single card-buy.

It&#039;s fascinating to watch the different solutions grind away at the problem and to see who had the most efficient engine—and best timing—at the end.

The only knock is for the flaccid theme, which is, perhaps, thankfully thin, given how mechanical the game is and how fast it plays with experienced players.  (It&#039;s not unusual for your turn to come back around before you&#039;re done shuffling from the last one.)  A narrative layer would probably just slow everything down.

That said, I like to think of it as scratch-building a Ferrari and then seeing how much cocaine I can hide in the gas tank while still getting it across the border.  And then maybe something about fire-breathing pimps.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>This ends up hovering at a sweet Lagrange point halfway between a table-top minis game and an RPG.  

I like the basic game engine, especially in keeping combat to a single dice throw—range, hit and damage all in one tumble.  

It can be a hellish challenge for the Marines, however (a win for them is a difficult stunt to pull off), but as long as everyone knows that from the get-go it can make for a good, albeit tense, time.  (And when they do win, standing high-fives, jocular invectives, and a decent amount of crowing are well in order.)

All in all a fun combat adventure game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A fun-enough light filler, but just barely.

PROS:  When played quickly, it has the rapid back-and-forth feel of a fencing duel.  Short play time.  And, most importantly, the wife liked it.

CONS:  Game-feel is ultimately thin and meatless.  Repetitive.  Card-counting is a pleasureless chore.

BOTTOM LINE:  Try it out if you get a chance—it&#039;s kinda neat for a little bit—but don&#039;t rush out and buy it.

The best part is when you challenge another player, essentially calling the guards on them.  This leads to the kid with the dice screaming &quot;Help!  Guards!

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>The most fun I had playing this game was when we had a big bag of rubber bands and took turns seeing who could put the most rubber bands around their head/face.  So I guess you should just get a big bag of rubber bands instead.

UPDATE:  The comment above is the last time I played this as an adult, with adults, somewhere in the early &#039;90s.  As a kid I played the hell out of this... until the cards were as soft as li&#039;l baby blankets &amp; the box was destroyed.  Fast-forward to 2011 when I loaned that once-much-loved game out to a friend with two small daughters interested in fantasy home invasion.  It was a HUGE hit, firing those young imaginations and setting them on a trajectory that will surely end up somewhere in [i]Dungeons &amp; Dragons[/i] proper.  As it should be.

So if you ask li&#039;l me &amp; the two battle-princesses it gets a super-solid [b]11!![/b].  The 5 is sans kids.

PS.  Box is long gone.  Smashed flat as the loser in a fight between gravity and a shortsighted lack of papercraft engineering.</comment>				</item>

Well, if you lived next door to a pie factory, owned a gun and were immortal, then your life would be exactly like [i]Dungeonquest[/i].  Every day you would wake to the maddening smell of fresh, hot pie; you would load your gun and hop the wall only to

[i]get in a firefight with the geriatric security guard and catch a hot one in the neck

make it through the window above the jacuzzi-sized mixing tubs, briefly

get &quot;raspberried&quot; by a robot[/i]

And so on, forever, because while guns make you brave, pies make you stupid.  And immortality makes you eternally susceptible to both.

[b][size=18]•[/size][/b]

[i]Any game where you can get your head whacked clean off by a swinging blade on your first turn get an instant 8 in my book.*[/i]

[b]Card-combat mini-game:[/b]  Looks weirdly complicated at first, but gets easier with repeat play.  Still, the setup, play, and cleanup just takes too long and feels at odds with the spirit of the game.  Ultimately we ditched it for the DQ Combat Die, below.

[b]First play:[/b]  Combat was like hitting the pause button on the game to do this other thing, breaking the flow of play.  It got to where one person was complaining every time combat occurred—since it stopped the game dead—and I learned to dread any combat.  Not because it was necessarily deadly or scary, which would be nicely thematic, but because it seemed like such an incongruous bolt-on interruption of what was otherwise a hilarious character grinder.

UPDATE:  Okay, I get it.  The card combat is the one chance for player interaction in this, and does allow you to personally stick your finger in your neighbor&#039;s eye.  I approve, I&#039;m glad it&#039;s there, but I just wish it were more smoothly integrated with the rest of the game.  It is literally possible for the person doing the cleanup to still be sorting &amp; shuffling when their turn comes back around in a full 4p game!

UP-UPDATE:  Bumping to a 9.  This thing&#039;s potentially a 10, but I&#039;m gonna make DQ work for it.  The only thing holding it back at this point is the relative clunkiness of the combat system.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is less of a [i]game[/i] game and more of an [i]experience[/i]—you play it for the express purpose of stepping into a dungeon and seeing what happens next!

And instead of being a &quot;standard&quot; fantasy dungeon where you murder everything in front of you and load up on loot, it&#039;s more of a &quot;realistic&quot; fantasy dungeon where you are mostly just there to supply the scary skeletons and spilled coins for the next adventurer.

The shockingly sudden unfairness of it [i]is[/i] the game, and makes winning—even if you only crawled out with 20 gold to show for your suffering—super-sweet.

[b]At its core [i]DQ[/i] is a push-your-luck story generator.[/b]  Anything done to monkey with that misses the point entirely, and, to my mind, breaks the game.  There are lots of other dungeon crawl/home invasion simulators out there that do the superhero thing—this one&#039;s the Coen Brothers version where we are the stupid criminals, and get exactly what we deserve...

So let go of that rock in the middle of the river and just go with the flow:

My only complaint would be how hard Wizards is pushing minis with this; it would be easy for one to believe that minis are *required* for play, when really all you need is paper, pencils, dice and big, fat imaginations.  All that aside, this boxed set does a great job of laying it all out in an accessible, stair-stepped fashion.

A great gift for kids—especially if you&#039;re going to play it with them.

(Comments refer to the 3rd edition.)

:goo:

The 4th edition starter is pretty slick, though it comes with cardboard disks instead of pre-painted minis, which is funny since unlike 3rd edition, 4th edition REQUIRES the use of minis and a battle grid...  The game has morphed considerably from starter RPG to tactical dungeon combat simulator with this edition.  Not a bad thing—it&#039;s good at what it does—but personally I like to keep my tactical minis games and RPGs as far away from each other as possible.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Nice enough, but I have a thing against suddenly having to play a table-top minis game in the middle of an RPG session.  It yanks the players out of the consensual dream-state of group storytelling and forces them to move little bits of plastic around on the coffee table.

Theater of the mind, baby, theater of the mind!

And, worst of all, using minis really hampers the DM&#039;s &quot;fudge perogative&quot;—you know, where you said you were behind the barricade, hiding, and yet a kobold managed to sneak up on you anyhow...  Just my 2 gp.

PS.  The collectible aspect blows double-plus hard.  For the love of baking soda just sell them in sets ala [i]Heroscape[/i].

UPDATE:  The new (2006) version of this game is pretty fun.  The double-sided full-color maps are gorgeous and immersive; the stat cards are now cleaned up and color-coded; even the minis have slicker paint-jobs.  The rules have been tweaked to make it easier to put together a team (read: you don&#039;t have to buy bucketloads of minis just to feel like you&#039;re able to play) and victory conditions have been opened up and spread out to afford at least two paths to a win.  (Kill the other team and/or occupy objective areas.)  A decent improvement over the old version, but still really only viable if you&#039;re into [i]D&amp;D[/i].</comment>				</item>

[floatleft][imageid=994268 small][/floatleft]
I love the way the box art evokes &#039;70s pulp fantasy—the lurid, blacklight colors, the hero surging ferociously forward as his foes fall fatally felled.  Even the title font is reminiscent of an acid rock album cover.

The game pretty much hits all those marks—psychedelic and muscular, you cleave through masses of enemies, giving each of them a gullet-loosening taste of steel or a marrow-roasting blast of black magic.  And the whole time the axes wail with soul-blistering guitar solos that propel you forward into the arms of either an appropriately outsized sex object or Death Itself...

Also, few things are as satsifying as dual-wielding a hapless goblin to death who was probably doing nothing more than innocently poking his head out his front door to see what all the ruckus was about.</comment>				</item>

The super-simple system delivers, full of flavor.  Of the three out so far this one feels the most like &quot;standard&quot; [i]D&amp;D[/i]—the monsters, magic items, and characters are charmingly familiar.

All in all a fantastic romp.</comment>				</item>

[b]Thoughts after one play:[/b]  I&#039;m pretty sure that all the various reports of &quot;too easy/too hard&quot; are due to incorrect play (a critical issue with other co-ops like [gameid=823], [gameid=37046] &amp; [gameid=30549])—missing a single, small rule* or even just altering the order of certain events** could make the entire system cascade in one direction or the other.

The rulebook is needlessly obtuse for what is essentially a push-your-luck dice game—[i]assemble dice pool, roll, bank or re-roll[/i] shouldn&#039;t be so hard to explain.  We hit many, many rules ambiguities in our first play, several of which were only answered with a very careful line-by-line rereading of the rules afterward, as the answers were often a single sentence hidden inside a paragraph, and thus easily missed.  Still other questions await an offical FAQ.

Other than that the game is pretty, the components excellent, and rolling dice is fun.  Also, I think no fewer than three people got eaten by the Shoggoth in the Koi Pond.

[i]Nice.[/i]

[b]After three plays:[/b]  The key to all push-your-luck dice games is, of course, banking and re-rolls.  It took a couple plays to figure out when and where this is possible, as the rulebook is less than effective at spelling (hah) it out.

[b]• Success = keep going[/b]
You can keep rolling as long as you are successfully completing tasks, but, of course, that shrinks the pool, making future tasks more difficult.

[b]• Clues[/b]
Clues are HUGE as they are the primary mechanism that lets you bank and re-roll.  Spend a clue to re-roll any or all of the dice in the pool.  Most games of this ilk allow a certain number of bank/re-rolls—e.g., three in [i]Yahtzee[/i]—but here you&#039;re limited to how many clues you have.

[b]• Focus/Assist[/b]
You can bank a single die on yourself, or a single die on a fellow Investigator on the same Adventure card... but you must fail to complete a task first.  A small booby prize, though with the die you lose for failure you&#039;re down two dice in the pool, so it&#039;s a gamble.

[b]• Spells[/b]
Cast before the roll (a dangerous gamble) and bank one or two dice out of a roll (though this could be brutally bad if you are [i]required[/i] to bank).  Post-FAQ update:  Spells are now cast [i]after[/i] the roll, to bank dice you already know you want to keep.  Does the double-whammy of making the game easier (?!) and removing any downside to spells—removing all thematic coherence.  Lovecraftian spells are supposed to be dangerous, but it&#039;s all happy fairy magic now.

[i]Elder Sign[/i] doesn&#039;t feel like a true push-your-luck experience until you understand how to pull off clever combos with all these mechanisms.  Then the game really opens up and delivers.

Still, as a tuned co-op machine it misfires badly if you forget the small rules*** or get the sequencing of certain choices or events wrong.  Looking very forward to an offical FAQ to clean this thing up.

[b]After [-]six[/-] [-]seven[/-] eight plays:[/b]  I [i]almost[/i] get the sense I&#039;m playing it correctly.  Almost.

[b]After nine plays:[/b]  Okay, I finally get it.  Elder Sign is a light, storytelling larf, along the lines of [gameid=27627], rather than a tight, cruel co-op engine like [gameid=30549].  Expectations reset accordingly. 

[b]Final Analysis:[/b]  Man, I wanted to love this game.  It&#039;s totally in my wheelhouse—Lovecraft, dice, quick co-op.  [b]But the first printing is a total loss.[/b]  The rulebook is wrong on several fundamental issues (spells, focus/assist, etc.), three of the characters need to have new rules scrawled on their cards, and the FAQ changes make the game stupid easy.

Lovecraft + co-op + easy = WTF?!

A good co-op needs to have an out-of-the box win-rate below 50% in order to bear repeat play—the tension of not knowing whether or not you&#039;re going to survive [i]is[/i] the game.  It also incentivizes &quot;beating&quot; the game and gives big emotional payback for a hard-fought win.  Elder Sign has none of this.  I&#039;m not even sure we&#039;ve ever lost.

Yes, I could make up rules to increase the difficulty but that&#039;s not what I paid FFG for.  If I wanted to make my own games, or houserule the hell out of the ones I own (and then blunder through personal playtesting to see if they work) then I&#039;d be doing that.  If a game is a &quot;make-your-own&quot; kit then say so on the box.

[b]I&#039;m sorry I was an early adopter on this one.[/b]  Rating dropped to a barely deserved 5.


[size=7]* Like adding a Doom Token to the Doom Track whenever an Investigator is devoured.

** Like what happens when you complete an Adventure card:

1.  Receive reward(s)
2.  Move Investigators to Entrance
3.  Remove dice &amp; take card as trophy
4.  Draw new Adventure card

is important as monsters in the &quot;reward&quot; line cannot be put on the new Adventure card.  An easily missed, teeny-tiny detail.  Post-FAQ update:  Nope!  Monsters are now an exception and can be added to the new card.  This change does the double-whammy of making the game easier while adding an exception to the rules.  Just what it needed...

*** &quot;Lose sanity/stamina&quot; is entirely different from &quot;adjust your sanity/stamina&quot;—thus, the stamina cost on something like the Hallway on Fire cannot be prevented with Food, for instance.  Another tiny detail that is merely implied by word-choice in the rules... and, upon closer inspection, the rules use both interchangeably.  So, the question is, can you use a steak dinner to save yourself from a fire?  Or kill a Ghost with Whiskey?  Post-FAQ update:  Yes.  Yes you can.[/size]</comment>				</item>

[size=7]*This play had an inordinate number of new players—three, I think—and we don&#039;t allow alpha-dogging in our co-ops.  A crack team of veterans would have won this one.

**Though without the solo games this jumps to 80%.  I consider solo play to be a degenerate variant as I play with a single character alone; Mr. Launius has stated elsewhere that the game is really &quot;balanced&quot; (or at least designed) for four characters at a time, recommending the full compliment for solo play.  I dislike the fiddly overhead of running an entire team by myself, and besides, the game is much more challenging with a single character.  And that&#039;s a good thing.[/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>[b]tl;dr[/b] — In terms of making the game harder, [i]Unseen Forces[/i] misses the mark; but as an expansion that adds more of pretty much everything so that no two games (stories) are [i]ever[/i] the same, it&#039;s a triumph.  I would not hesitate to recommend it for those who use the game as a storytelling engine.  In that regard it&#039;s a must-have.

[microbadge=3412]

So far we&#039;ve won almost every game with the expansion, and only one of those felt anywhere near close.  BUT—from a narrative perspective, all of those games were highly entertaining.  Groans, cheers, laughter—the sessions evoked real emotions and made for a memorable evening every time.

The curse die, an element that looms so large in the rules—as in [i]oh, man if someone gets cursed they are[/i] boned—ends up being a paper tiger.  It&#039;s almost never an issue, is easily avoided, and except for when Tsathoggua is AO, easily remedied.

PS.  I can&#039;t tell you how much I appreciate the fact that the new cards are [i]exactly[/i] the same size as the old ones.  One thing that put me off buying FFG expansions was mismatched card sizes—even when they&#039;re off by just a little bit they clump up when shuffled and are obvious in the deck.  And I [i]hate[/i] sleeves.  But the [i]Unseen Forces[/i] cards are perfect.

PPS.  The expansion box top makes an excellent die rolling tray.  We had been using the original box top but the new one is a much more convenient size for passing around the table, especially with larger groups.

UPDATE:  The Master Mythos cards make the game as rugged as it needs to be—[i]if[/i] they show up.  It&#039;s still a cakewalk without &#039;em.

√ [i]Party at Hearst Castle[/i]

√ [i]Strangle a wizard[/i]

[microbadge=3392]

This is my favorite kind of game, a [i]choose-your-own-adventure[/i] book cut up and pasted onto cards.*

Now that we&#039;ve played enough to get the rhythm of the thing I quite like it, especially the feeling of putting your own team together, via allies, and taking on different aspects of the mega-plot while coordinating with other globe-trotting groups.  You can almost see the red arrows gliding from place to place while the adventure-travel music beats a tattoo of ominous progress.

The mechanical stuff&#039;s fine, I guess—I don&#039;t really notice it, which says a lot—but so far the emergent narratives have been fantastic.  Which is all I really care about.

So, does this replace [gameid=15987]?  Not really.  They&#039;re two different beasts.  [i]Arkham[/i] is a mechanically quirky and convoluted thing (facets I find charming) about three-fisted Mythos adventures in New England, while [i]Eldritch[/i] is the cleaner, tighter, &quot;more modern&quot; global version.  They&#039;re different enough to be distinct and enjoyed for the unique experiences they provide.


[size=7]*For best effect, have the left-hand player draw and read the card for the active player—in dramatic fashion—while keeping the pass/fail results secret.  Only tell them the choices, and then once made and rolled-for, the resulting outcome—don&#039;t give away any results they didn&#039;t get.  This keeps things [i]mysterious[/i].  (It&#039;s best for the left-hand player to do this as the right-hand player may still be doing bookkeeping while finishing up their turn, and it gives everyone a rotating slot as storyteller.[/size]

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is the cards &#039;n dice version of Sailor Jerry, Charles Manson and Walt Disney taking turns making Aleister Crowley airtight while the third wheel does the Buffalo Bill dance in the PCP space helmet.*

[b]Look, there&#039;s no mystery to it—if you&#039;re not sure if this is for you, it flat-out ain&#039;t.[/b]  I mean, c&#039;mon—the title is a dead giveaway in this regard.

For me, the game effortlessly evokes the sensation I strive for in [i]every game I play[/i], and underscores my perennial disappointment with Euros.  [i]Epic Spell Wars[/i] is pure theme, entirely unmoored and aggressively in service to itself... and somewhere beneath that country mile of sparkly-pink frosting is a tiny, skull-cracking nut of impossibly compressed chaos of the [i]take-that[/i] variety.

[imageid=2531956 original]

You won&#039;t win because you&#039;re smart or good at games, but because you were balls-out lucky.  [i]Just like a real wizard.[/i]

In the end this is much better thought of as a party game where the goal is to entertain your friends—throw yourself into it and get that done right and everyone at the table &quot;wins&quot;.

(Like other games of this ilk it benefits from being [i]as short as possible[/i] and played infrequently; I highly recommend the &quot;Quick Match Variant&quot; over the normal—and potentially overlong—rules as written.)

	<numplays>17</numplays>			<comment>[b]T[/b]he handpicked crowd was cheering, as they were obligated to do, when we met for the last time at the podium.  We smiled like the serpents we were and clasped hands as murderous apes must, and [i]sotto voce[/i], beyond the reach of the mic, you breathed:

&quot;I&#039;ll see you shot or hanged.  Maybe both.&quot;

My smile broadened as I clapped you on the back and turned to the auto-exaltation of the crowd.  &quot;That would be just the thing, wouldn&#039;t it,&quot; I hissed through my teeth, &quot;Just the thing for a [i]traitor[/i].&quot;

All that work for all those years, from the moment of dark enlightenment through the weaving of our self-culling networks, our ambitions entwining and diverging as power increased and our foes fell away, all that work to be the one wearing Orwell&#039;s boot—[i]forever[/i]—undone in a blink as the terrorist bomb ripped through the reviewing stand.

Our memorial statues were revealed that same day, the day the new regime promised to bring the haters of freedom to a terrible justice, for that is what, above all, the Republic stands for.

[microbadge=28503]

Mechanically, this is just a [i]grind nibs to trade for nobs and score dinguses[/i] worker-placement affair... but I&#039;m not here for any of that.  Just know that all the mechanical stuff works, and works just fine.

What sets this apart, though, is the theme and the way that theme is brilliantly woven into the proceedings.  For example, everyone begins the game with a revealed recruit from one of four factions, as well as a hidden recruit to be revealed later.  Players sharing the same faction will end up working semi-cooperatively—helping to dig the same tunnel, pushing the same allegiance track forward to increase their faction&#039;s power.  The unrevealed recruits add the wrinkle of undeclared alliances—if my mole is the same faction as your active recruit then I know we&#039;re kinda in cahoots*... something of which you&#039;re not necessarily aware.  [i]Delicious[/i].

There are so many other bright things I could point to—the unrestricted trade of commodities, resources and artifacts; colluding to freeze other players out of constuction sites; the way low morale hinders your ability to collect artifacts (disaffected workers will rat you out to superiors); and on and on and on...

The attention to detail and the organic cohesion of theme, mechanics, and presentation are breathtaking.

I could very easily see this becoming one of my favorite games—instead of farming to impress the king how &#039;bout if I impress myself by lobotimizing some workers?

[i]Get in the machine, you![/i]

UPDATE:  Enjoying this enough that I popped for the &quot;Supreme&quot; version, both to get the up-rezzed bits (gold bricks!  [i]brick[/i] bricks!  tiny stones!) and to get the &quot;faceless&quot; recruits as I&#039;m deathly allergic to [thread=1059815]&quot;girlfriend mage&quot;[/thread].  You see, the game comes with fish-out-of-water backer faces inserted into the art; not being an actual backer myself, I figured the &quot;faceless&quot; recruits would look like these:

[imageid=1901168 original]
But they don&#039;t...  And one is even a baby—[i]a baby[/i].

[i]Sigh.[/i]  The moral of the story is that there&#039;s no reason to splurge and scramble for an aftermarket &quot;Supreme&quot; edition—&quot;Deluxe&quot; works just fine if you want the super-fancy stuff.

UP-UPDATE:  In actual play I find that the backer-face recruits don&#039;t annoy me as much as I thought they would; in fact, the little bit of personality they add to the game is... actually kinda nice, I suppose.  Still, if they ever end up offering the original faceless ones I&#039;d grab &#039;em, no hesitation.

PS.  If you&#039;re wondering what to do with those allegiance bonus markers, try [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/15121843#15121843]this[/url].

UP-UP-UPDATE:  The luck factor can only be mitigated through nepotism—as you fall behind and/or are cruelly afflicted by The System you must get busy wheeling and dealing through unrestricted trade.  Don&#039;t be shy about greasing palms and maintaining those connections... for only when you find yourself in that place where you have no friends are you truly hosed.

After 15 plays:  8 --&gt; 7  Start positions are precipitously uneven and unknowable until the game begins, at which point you are either unjustly rewarded or iniquitously punished until it&#039;s over.  I still like what it does, it&#039;s just that sometimes being the dystopic object lesson—[i]again[/i]—is hard to take.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:  7 --&gt; 6  Wore this out in 17 plays.  Far too much of how the game will go for you lies in which recruits you get in the initial deal:  Pick the same factions as others at the table (especially if you get a pair of a popular faction) who also give you freebies or otherwise enhance the economics of any single die placement and your game will be [i]awesome[/i].  If not, you will lose—good play notwithstanding—to opponents of equal skill who lucked-out with better recruits.  And there&#039;s just no good fix for this.  I&#039;ll keep it around, but we&#039;re done with it for now.

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>A very good family game with bidding, multiple paths to victory, and just enough chaos and player interaction to keep things hot.

It&#039;s rather light (read:  weak) as a gamer game.  But with a couple of rules tweaks it can be downright nasty:  

1) # of players minus 1 for number of genes each round

2) players start with zero cards, and 

3) cards up for bid are face-up.

UPDATE:  Been replaying this lately (Summer/Fall of &#039;11) with the straight-up rules-as-written.  Works just fine, sans tweaks, for what it is.  Fun, with some neat little systems.  Succeeds in evoking the weird bloat and contraction of migration, population explosion and massive die-offs.  Rating up from 7 to 8.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>15</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s like playing [gameid=2392] after having your eyes gouged out (painlessly yet comically) so you&#039;re wearing a raw bandana of white gauze around your face with two reddish-brown circles seeping through.  Your hand quivers as you present your offering of fake gems; you can smell the natives as they press in, eager to see who screws up.  [i]Hopefully[/i], they breathe in unison, [i]hopefully it will be that one with the big, fat head...[/i]

The kink, and what makes the game, is that ties cancel out—so that if several people would have won the bid (because they all bid optimally) they are removed from contention and the winner is sought from the remaining players.  This process of elimination continues until only one person remains.  This leads to a wonderful, awfully weird headspace where you are not trying to make *optimal* bids, but *unique* bids.

The result is a delicious game of quintuple-think where things very rarely ever go the way you want—if your idea of fun is trying to ride a giant electric chaos-whip, then grease up and hop on—this one&#039;s for you!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>[b]tl;dr[/b] — Don&#039;t know from the show, but as a storytelling/adventure game this works great.

This is a &quot;story game&quot; first and foremost—it provides, via cards and mechanics, a series of dots that you and your friends can connect to spin an engaging yarn of your time out in the black.  In that regard it has far more in common with [thing=21523]Runebound[/thing] (and the like*) than [thing=131646]Merchant of Venus[/thing].  As it stands, this is a pretty middle of the road pick-up-and-deliver game—but it is an [i]awesome[/i] story game.

I suppose I should admit that I am not a [i]Firefly[/i] fan—I never got past the first couple episodes of the TV series (especially when they were pandering so obviously to segments of fandom that I am not a member of**), though I did enjoy [i]Serenity[/i].  This is important to know as my flaccid interest in the license in no way detracts from this fine game.

As a licensed product this one transcends—to an amazing degree—the usually poor treatment such things get.  The bits are all gorgeous and high-quality, especially the money (and I loves me some paper money***).  The game is mechanically sound, works, and provides an interesting storytelling engine.  Instead of phoning it in the designers and producers definitely heaped some love and skill on this.

Speaking prematurely and from the hip I get the impression that the sweet spot for this will be 3 players—I fear that with 4 there will be just too much &quot;story&quot; flying around as well as too much downtime waiting to get back to yours.  But we shall see...

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>[b]tl;dr[/b] — [i]Light &amp; fast = FUN; serious &amp; slow = OH GOD KILL ME NOW[/i]

[b]Thoughts after a single 2p game:[/b]

It works well as a chill activity with a glass of wine &amp; some downtempo ambient.  It&#039;s pretty, has neat little puzzles to solve, and everything you do nets you some kind of return, so there&#039;s a feeling of constant forward progress (as opposed to irritating impotence).  I like the dark undertones of Rasputin-like manipulation of entire peoples, murder, and slave sacrifice in order to treat with demons.  But that&#039;s just me.

I think it would be [i]absolute hell[/i] with hardcore gamers, especially at max player count.  Each turn can be laboriously optimized for maximum payoff with minimum setup for the next player; but this process, at least in the early game, involves brute-forcing all possible moves to climb the various branches of the game tree, a fractally-fuzzed boredom bush.  This might be okay if you&#039;re playing against quantum computers (spoiler alert:  you will lose), but it would be excruciating with savannah-born meat-brains (chuck a spear, check; grind [i]n[/i]-ply game states in a timely fashion, not so much).  A chess clock would be a must... or you could just hold everyone to casual play and save the thinky for heavier games where such deep contemplation is part of the intended experience.

Probably most enjoyable with your honey, family play, or two couples as a social activity.

[b]Thoughts on the 2p rules:[/b]

It&#039;s a bummer that the process of turn-order bidding for two is merely implied in the rules—maybe more obviously for some, but still.  It would have been nice to have a small, concrete example of what must otherwise be intuited.

[q=&quot;No one&quot;]
The two players will bid for [i]four[/i] turn order slots; it is therefore possible, through clever and/or aggressive bidding, to get two (or more!) turns in a row.*


[size=7]*If you go 3,4 in one turn and then 1,2 in the next that&#039;s [i]four turns in row![/i][/size][/q]
UPDATE:  After 3 more games at 4p, it&#039;s a solid 7.  Works as intended—a pleasant little puzzler with lots to do, Nerf®-edged back-and-forth, and gorgeous to boot.

[b]Stuff we got wrong:[/b]

• [i]Resource cards are hidden.[/i]
Good luck finding that in the rulebook...

• [i]Djinn &amp; the market only refresh between rounds.[/i]
What you see during turn order bidding is all you&#039;ll get until next time...

• [i]Viziers score 1 VP each, then +10[/i] per person[i] with fewer than you.[/i]
So if the final vizier count is 5, 4, 3, 1 the scores will be 35, 24, 13, and 1.  This will crazy-change the game...

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>The three-player game is amazing, unlike any card game you&#039;ve ever played before.  The ever-shifting trumps and the card distribution (one suit is weighted to the top, another toward the bottom; the last one is evenly distributed throughout) will bend your head in the best way possible.  The trick is to figure out how to get into the devil-humping business and then get out when the bottle is cheap, but not TOO cheap...

For whosoever hath the bottle at the end GOES STRAIGHT TO HELL!!!

The four-player game works, but just barely; with fewer cards in hand you have fewer options and less control.  This really wants to be a three-player game.

But all in all, highly recommended—just don&#039;t confuse it with the ribald and scandalous [i]Fleischenteufel[/i].</comment>				</item>

Lots of opportunity for bluff and brinksmanship crammed into a little package and short time span.  A must for the Serious Games Library.  Recommended.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>The box should come with a big, orange, jaggy-balloon sticker:  WARNING—NOT AN ACTUAL DUNGEON CRAWL!!!

If anything, it&#039;s an extremely sideways abstraction of the current [i]World of Warcraft[/i]-style MMORPG (pronounced &quot;more-pig&quot;) craze.  Which is to say, kill to level up, level up to kill.  Count the pelts to find the winner.

There is a lot more going on under the hood here than the theme or rules would have you believe.  The game is easier to grok (at least for me) when reduced to an economic system where you buy VPs based on your credit rating and cash on hand.  The more you buy, the better your credit gets, but at the cost of your cash.  The tension in the game (as stated elsewhere by others) comes down to deciding when to buy vs. when to take some free cash...  Timing and position are everything.

Layered on top of this you have a tactical movement and positioning system and spells which allow you to muck with pretty much every aspect of the game.

Caused much discussion after a single play.

UPDATE:  We&#039;ve been playing the game horribly wrong due to the use of the term &quot;power supply&quot; being used in the rules for both a player&#039;s personal stash AND the communal supply.  After going through the rulebook a paragraph at a time and re-collating the rules for comprehension and gameflow, the &quot;real&quot; game actually goes up a point in my estimation.  A tight little screw-fest.

UP-UPDATE:  

[c]          Wisdom = Level
      Power Chip = Endurance
Take Power Chips = Resting[/c]

Makes [i]way more sense[/i] as a dungeon crawl with the right terminology.

It comes in on the long side, but this can be mitigated if players take their turns in a snappy manner, especially Dracula.  Highly recommended for patient players who are into the milieu.

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Man, what a letdown.  This looked great, and I feel as if I should love it, but it really felt flat to me.  I&#039;m not sure what it&#039;s missing—it just came out as a mechanical exercise instead of the nail-biting, fate-hanging-on-the-turn-of-a-card experience it promised.

Perhaps I just need to relax and get into it more, but the cartoony art provides a speedbump I just can&#039;t clear.  Maybe... maybe if we had a more intuitive grasp of the rules so the game flows instead of clumps.  Nice idea, but that would require more plays, and this one&#039;s slipped far, far down the list.

UPDATE:  So we&#039;re playing and I&#039;m bumping along the bottom and we make it to stage III and then I get a work call that forces me to step away from the table for a bit...  Upon returning I find out I won.  

[i]Huh.[/i]

UPDATE:  6 --&gt; 7  Jeez, I don&#039;t know what my problem was.  This game&#039;s a riot with the right people!

UP-UPDATE:  Couple things.

1.  Don&#039;t let the engineer in your group endlessly noodle with the iPad app—he will build perfect ships no matter what tactics are employed against him, like &quot;bogart all cannons&quot; or the classic &quot;sand timer cartwheel&quot;.  And then he&#039;ll double all your scores.  [i]Forever.[/i]

2.  It takes a certain kind of emotional fortitude to not weep openly when you finally finagle things to punch it to the front of the pack and run down the four-dollar pirate, putting salvo after salvo of beam weapons through his papier-mâché flying saucer, and then you&#039;re not even buzzed from your first celebratory Zgwortz when you warp around a neutron star and straight into the teeth of [i]Voidbeard the Pirate[/i] with his nonstop fusillades that peel your battery nacelles, fountain crew into the silent black, and pick your guns and engines off one after the other and so on until you&#039;re just screaming for it all to stop [i]stop STOP![/i]  And then the iPad-practiced engineer comes in and mops him up for the 12-dollar bounty.  There are words to describe that sensation, but they carry far more meaning when screamed inside an isolating helmet rather than read off a dumb screen.

[imageid=2347067]
[size=7]Fig. 1 — [i]The four-dollar pirate suddenly realizes
that macaroni, glue and glitter make for terrible
starship armor.[/i][/size]


[size=7]NOTE 1:  Normally I hate it when people use the generic term &quot;dollar&quot; for all intermediary economic exchange units in games when there are already perfectly appropriate game-specific designators like &quot;ducats&quot; or &quot;galacticreds&quot; or &quot;orphan femurs&quot;, but it turns out that &quot;four-dollar pirate&quot; is funnier than the thematic alternative.

NOTE 2:  Voidbeard the Pirate, so-called due to his hideous predilection for weaving curdled space-time into his beard to strike terror into the hearts of his victims.  And man, does it [i]ever[/i].[/size]</comment>				</item>

&quot;Shut up and go eat yer gruel, squealing fruit of my loins!  I&#039;m late for the yacht races!&quot;

UPDATE:  Long ago, while playing an early printing with my kids, I figured I&#039;d teach them a [i]valuable lesson[/i] about gambling—and inject some excitement into the game for me—by irresponsibly throwing the maximum amount of money down on the wheel every turn.  (Un)fortunately my numbers hit almost every time and I ended up the winner by a massive margin.

Me:  Uh, so you kids know it almost [i]never[/i] works like that in real life, right?

Kids:  If you say so.

Me:  No—that&#039;s the lesson.  Gambling is [i]bad[/i].

Kids:  [dollar signs sparkling in their eyes] Uh-huh.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Rough trade in the form of cardboard and plastic.  A crazy, ever-shifting puzzle that actually prevents immersion in the rich theme.  If you let the mechanical aspects of the game fuzz into the background in order to provide a foundation for the experience of being a Taoist monk desperately fighting the legions of Hell, you will lose.

The game begs you to do so, with gorgeous art and super production values, but ultimately you have to look past the theme and see the grinding gears of the puzzle box if you have any hope of ever winning.  Also, there&#039;s an enormous luck component (repeat die rolls to exorcise the ghosts), meaning that even optimal play can be fatally hosed with gallons of demon-tentacle spew.  And the rulebook is... nigh impenetrable.  I&#039;m still not completely sure how some parts of the game work.

For all that, it&#039;s an 8?  Yeah—it&#039;s stuck with me, I&#039;ve been thinking about it, and I want to play it again until I beat it to death.

UPDATE:  Dropped to a 7.  Suffers from the same problem most co-op games do, but to a degree I just can&#039;t get over:  one person masterminding everyone else&#039;s turn.  Perhaps it&#039;s better suited to solo play instead of &quot;one guy solves the puzzle while directing three chit-pushers&quot;.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>(NOTE:  Comments refer to the 2005 First Edition; this issue has reportedly been corrected in later printings.  Not sure about the last bit, though...)

The idea is great, the execution not so much.  The main problem lies in the printing on the cards—it&#039;s small, fussy, and blurred.  Also, the card backs are not printed opaque enough to obscure all of the info on the front.  It&#039;s not difficult to discern what kind of card you&#039;re drawing next.

In the end the transparent overlay is a gimmick that gets in the way of the actual game.

[microbadge=3148]

HIDEOUS TOXIC UPDATE:  I went and dug this out—[i]ten years later[/i]—and found that the cards had done something stinky, sticky and industrial.  The clock turns all things to poison eventually; these just got to it sooner than expected.

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>After a single play of the Black Box Edition:

I love tableau games with multi-use cards ([gameid=8217], [gameid=28143], etc.) so this one&#039;s right up my blood &amp; vomit-spewed alley... with a really nice statue of Bacchus at the end.  Of course, it&#039;s mostly made of rubble, but who&#039;s to know but the architect and laborers?  And I had them all, uh, &quot;exiled&quot;.

I&#039;ve always been drawn to the theme and play style of [i]Glory[/i] while being successfully repelled by the hideous clip-art/cartoon &quot;artwork&quot;.  The Black Box Edition is absolutely gorgeous, with a very hip mid-century modern graphic design vibe.  And oh, man, can I dig it.

Ordered immediately after first contact and practically vibrating with excitement to see how my regular group takes to it.

UPDATE:  [i]Six plays later...[/i]  Would that I could be but the Rubble Baron, for at least that has a whiff of the Patrician to it.  But alas, lying here alongside a stout and world-wending road without thumbs and sore where the boots have found me I am possessed of nothing but the fact that every road needs a ditch—these things are necessary, and I am clogging up the works.

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Great fun when played as a silly party game with lots of role-playing.  You can go from being the most wretched, fawning peon possible, then, as your luck changes, lording it over everyone all uber-patrician style.  The game itself is a mutant strain of Chinese climbing games, reminiscent of [i]Big Two[/i], et al.*, where the goal is to play all your cards and &quot;go out&quot; first.  But really, that mechanism takes a distant back seat to the social position shenannigans.  I think the &quot;game&quot; would suck without them.  Rating reflects play with silly-sports.

GOLDEN WIFE-QUOTE:  [said with a disturbing case of crazy-eye] &quot;I don&#039;t want to play [i]Dalmuti[/i]—I want to play a game where I can [i]win[/i].&quot;

(It must be said that when we do play she spends an inordinate amount of time in the Dalmuti seat; she was just out for blood that night.)

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Started out with a shaggy pony, then got dogs.  We hunted whale.  [i]We hunted whale.[/i]

[COLOR=#66CCFF][size=24]*[/size][/COLOR]
The narwhal breached the ice and ironically speared Ugalik clean through the chest.  He dropped his own harpoon and hacked at the great beast&#039;s tooth with his meteorite ax as he was lifted into the air and rotated suddenly legs-up and wriggling, then slapped into the black, killing water.  The whale dismissed us with a wave of flukes and the sting of icy spray.  And so we had no meat or blubber but Aulanurk had her choice of husbands that season.

BUY THE TICKET, TAKE THE RIDE

Like all Eklund games, this is one&#039;s a quirky girlfriend—deep, but not straight up-and-down, nearly unfathomable, unique, unforgettable, haunting.  And here she&#039;s whipping up a human experience milkshake out of overfull scoops of

geology
meteorology
biology
anthropology
religion
history

Am I forgetting some?  Probably.  [i]But goddamn it&#039;s tasty.[/i]  One half-baked play sent me down a fractal warren of Google rabbit holes to see just what the hell was up with [i]that[/i].  And [i]that[/i].  And... there goes your afternoon.

Know that you&#039;ll play this the first couple-five times [i]all wrong[/i] and just go for it—the experience is the thing, and every play gets better and better.

Oh, and if you can&#039;t tell from the first two paragraphs above, the thing bleeds stories that beg to be told—like the time the Thule and Tunit suckered the ill-prepared Norse into hunting orca.  That was a hilariously Bad Day.

UPDATE:  Man, I love this game.

Second Edition:

+ Oversized Elder placards instead of playing cards!

- [size=5]Micro-tiny text on Elder placards.[/size]
- New art.
- Rules tweaks...

The new art is more than sufficient—well-done and entirely consistent—it&#039;s just that it has 100% less personality and charm than the First Edition.  The overall feeling is generic and sterile, a stark contrast to the previous version&#039;s vividly organic cards.  It&#039;s the difference between flipping through an illustrated book and walking through a museum exhibit—the previous version was far more evocative and &quot;alive&quot;.*  

So, tiny changes in the rules between editions, [i]yeah[/i].  

Phil loves to tinker and I&#039;m not sure he ever truly abandons a game, especially when you can publish changes ad infinitum on the Internet and then rescind them the moment it turns out they don&#039;t actually work that well.  (Reference the [i]High Frontier[/i] rules merry-go-round.)  Given that his rulebooks read like one Phil Eklund sharing his notes with a nodding clone of Phil Eklund, this rules churn is especially annoying when it takes several plays to finally get them down, only to see they&#039;ve changed [i]again[/i]—and the natural inclination is to assume that any change made by the designer is a critical one, fixing something that&#039;s not quite right, when in reality it&#039;s just noodling for noodling&#039;s sake.

The key is to pick a version of the rules and stick with it—like we finally ended up doing for [i]High Frontier[/i]—so your friends don&#039;t kill you because every session is tweaked and feels like yet another learning game.  Or an extended playtest.

Regardless, if you&#039;re at all intrigued you should try this—it&#039;s the one of the best 3-player games I own.

(Up-rezzed with faux ivory dice &amp; painted wooden disks.)


[size=7]*Phil&#039;s &quot;kit-bashed&quot; card art is almost always shocking upon first contact, but there&#039;s a kind of deep symmetry to it, an overarching and unifying ethos that gives the rest of us benighted mortals a glimpse into his brilliant mind.  At first it looks like chaos, but as you play you see that it actually works—then it begins to grow on you, and when you finally &quot;get it&quot; your IQ goes up like fifteen points.[/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>The perfect gateway game for Reformation scholars?

This is one of those games you wouldn&#039;t end up playing unless you had a specific woody for the theme (at least one would hope).  Me, I get all sweaty for it.  The game has two issues that by themselves are no problem, but when combined work to kill it off:

1)  It takes all day to play.  Our &quot;learning game&quot; took eight hours; and

2)  It requires repeat plays to really grok the interlocking systems and possibilities.

This isn&#039;t a problem for me, personally—I enjoyed the hell out of that long Saturday spent with friends in the early 1500s.  But it will take insane levels of logistics to arrange a day off with a suitable quorum of six (&quot;An all-day game where we LARP the Reformation?  Holy crap—now THAT makes my pants fit funny!&quot;).  So really we&#039;re looking at [GAMEID=1] levels of replay...  like twice a year, max.  And that&#039;s a bummer.

If you&#039;re here asking, &quot;Is this game for me?&quot; take the [i]Here I Stand[/i] Compatibility Quiz:

1)  Does the idea of nailing stuff to a church door make you sweat?

2)  Do you have five friends who would fight over being the Pope or Martin Luther?

3)  Not counting those five friends, are you a social misfit who has no life such that you can spend whole days gaming without pissing any SOs off?

If you said &quot;no&quot; to any of the above, this probably isn&#039;t for you.

Provisional rating after one play = 8.

UPDATE:  The second play rockets this to a solid 10.  The first game was with five n00bs, the second with only three; both were six-player games.  Even though it was fraught with error and much page flipping, it was an incredible experience.  Can&#039;t wait to play it again!

Ideally, the ultimate game would be the seventh one, with the same six people; six games so that everyone gets a chance to play each power (as well as get all the kinks out of the system).  That seventh one would be the Real Game, with no n00bs, no one getting hammered through ignorance, and everyone knowing what everyone else is capable of...  I know there are at least two of us who are completely smitten with this game, and at least one other we can reliably convince to play, but I fear those other three slots will be forever sat in by n00bs playing for the very first time.  Sigh.  Time to install some more D-rings in the basement ceiling and break out the chloroform so I can collect some more, uh, [i]dedicated[/i] friends.

UP-UPDATE:  Fourth play, two n00bs.  Rock solid.  Also, we now have so many people up for this that we actually had two alternates waiting in the wings for an opening.

Super-simple roll-n-move with minor power-ups.  Nifty when played with those in the target demographic or as mindless filler with childlike, potty-mouthed adults.

There&#039;s no meat here—it&#039;s all cake and punch.  If you eat too much you&#039;ll vomit a crimson plume that looks alarmingly like blood.  But it&#039;s not.[/q]
The two-player outdoor/water set.

This one lacks the weapons store in the other sets, making the experience even thinner (if that&#039;s even possible).  Really just a barely-themed, five-minute dice-off.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We&#039;ve only played with Laglor (the peg-legged six-million dollar ape whose standard is a scything sheet of hot lead) and the Orc, but that&#039;s more than enough to make me a believer.  Sure, some of the powers are weak and the d20s and dice bags are shrug-enducing superfluosities—but the figures look great on the battlefield and are just plain fun.  And isn&#039;t that what [i]Heroscape[/i]&#039;s all about anyway?

The negatives have nothing to do with the game and everything to do with marketing.  Making these Toys R Us exclusives and charging an insane dollar amount made me grind my teeth while cursing the anal retentive 12-year-old that dwells within me (and seems to be responsible for all of my more questionable decisions).  As hard as it was to pay full price and as much as I was sure I would suffer from buyer&#039;s remorse, in the end I&#039;m glad I picked them up.  The reason?  One word:  [i]dice[/i].

The battle dice that come with each figure are fab.  Now everyone who plays gets their own set of dice, in unique colors, so no one can put the bad mojo on the communal blue-n-red dice.  No more having to wipe the dice off after Sweaty McGamer gets his man-funk all over them.  These are MY dice, there are many like them, but these are MINE.  Such a small thing, but in all honesty it&#039;s what I love most about this set.  YMMFV.</comment>				</item>

Captain America can richochet his adamantium shield off of multiple heads; Spider-Man is next to impossible to pin down; the Hulk gets stronger as he gets madder.  (It felt *perfect* to have him roll 12 (!) attack dice in the last round before he got knocked out:  6 for being the Hulk, plus 5 for being enraged, plus 1 for standing next to Cap.  I swear the Abomination got knocked all the way into next month&#039;s issue...  [b]KRAKA-[i]THOOOM!!![/i][/b])

Every battle feels like a series of splash-pages with

UPDATE:  I&#039;ve raised my score on this one due to the number of whoopin&#039; &#039;n hollerin&#039; knock-down drag-out wars we&#039;ve had.  The combat system is fast and simple, you don&#039;t have to paint the minis, and the terrain is fab.  No two games have ever been alike and the last one we played (a 500 points/side three-way slug-fest) ended with a single character with a single hit point left on the field.  Can&#039;t recommend this one enough!

	<numplays>40</numplays>			<comment>[center][size=6][COLOR=#878787]LIFETIME GAME [microbadge=28495]:star:[microbadge=28496] &quot;PLAY FOREVER&quot;[/COLOR][/size][/center]

[b]tl;dr[/b] — After 30 plays, this has become my most favorite game ever.  It is a Masterpiece, a Magnum Opus and there is nothing quite like it.  If you are even remotely into space science/exploration then this was built for you.  Just take your time, ease into it and don&#039;t be in a hurry to swallow the whole shebang in one go.

[q=40 Plays][b]This is the best version of the game.[/b]  &quot;Legacy&quot; [i]High Frontier[/i]—the base game with the [thing=68305]Expansion[/thing], and the published rules and maps as they stood in October of 2011—is a perfectly tight 5p/two-hour experience that gets exponentially better the more you play.

[i]Colonization[/i] complicated it out the yinyang and bloated it into a game that no longer fits inside most heads or a single evening.  And I&#039;m still not sure what 3rd Edition is doing.[/q]
[microbadge=21441]

Right now... just seriously geeking out on the science.  Shot a rover at Mars and managed to get it there, survived the aerobraking maneuver only to lose it in a sandstorm.

Intrigued and really looking forward to a proper play.

UPDATE:  First play.  [i]Mind blown.[/i]

UP-UPDATE:  Rockets to a solid 9 after two more back-to-back plays, one of which saw the Japanese lose salarynauts over Venus, the ESA looping the screams of their brave [i]aströnautes[/i] (breaking up on final approach to Comet Encke) in swanky discotheques, and the UN burning in [i]three full crews[/i] over Mars, one after the other, grinding the same doomed mission over and over again.  Twenty-four cosmonauts later, Mars was his.

Some thoughts:

[b]It&#039;s not nearly as complicated or difficult as the rules would have you believe.[/b]
This is the game that dares you to figure out how to play.  While the living rules and other attempts at simplified rules, summaries, walk-throughs &amp; etc. all help a great deal, none of them are as clear or straightforward as they could or should be.  Once you [i]do[/i] figure out how to play, the game&#039;s a lot simpler than it appears.  That&#039;s not to say it&#039;s not complex, but the complexity arises from the potential bushiness of the decision tree growing in the sandbox.

The obtuse rule book and the effort required to sift through the spray of Internet resources to figure out just how to play the damn thing keep it from a truly-deserved 10.

[b]The base game is more than enough for a good while.[/b]
It&#039;s a pretty enormous sandbox—you&#039;ve got the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars (Phobos &amp; Deimos), and a spray of asteroids &amp; comets, with a deep selection of tech to get you Out There... aaand no real direction.*  It&#039;s simultaneously terrifying and liberating.  You can run any mission you can imagine, any way you can finagle it.  While it&#039;s daunting trying to figure out just what to do, it&#039;s exhilarating when a really complicated orbital ballet comes together—solar sail a crew module out from Earth to rendezvous with a freighter carrying a high-tech thruster built by robots at your factory on a distant rock, ditch the sail and burn for the outpost where you stashed some prospecting robonauts, pick them up, refuel on an icy asteroid and wing to the outer edges of the solar system.

Ultimately, the unfortunate effort required to figure it all out is more than worth it.  There&#039;s no board game experience quite like it and I find myself daydreaming of the most harebrained and unlikely missions...

Can&#039;t wait to play more!

UP-UP-UPDATE:  More sandbox sim than game.  There is no &quot;rubber-banding&quot; mechanism to help those who fall behind, and whiffing on a single risky maneuver (aerobraking or hazard) can cost you the win.**  This isn&#039;t a knock against the game at all—it&#039;s a simulation with a lesson to teach, and it teaches it well:  space exploration &amp; exploitation is expensive, difficult and dangerous.  It&#039;s only for those with resolve and daring.  A frontier indeed.  When sitting down to roll through this it&#039;s best to adjust the mindset appropriately—it&#039;s an experience, a sim, a place to experiment and fail.  Attempting to game it or play it in a &quot;gamey&quot; fashion will result in a crippled, unsatisfying half-experience.

Surprisingly, playtime has hovered around two hours, even for our five-player games!

UP-UP-UP-UPDATE:  It&#039;s really, really hard to watch Taikonauts loot your billion-dollar landing site—using your flag to erase your footprints and your commemorative plaque as a hammer.  It&#039;s the kind of vandalism that hardens hearts and launches nukes...

I think this just might be my favorite game.

[size=7]*The pre-fab &quot;signpost&quot; missions are a good start, but some favor different tech over others which puts you in the Catch-22 position of not knowing good from bad without several plays.  Being a sandbox experience, failure is half the fun, right?

**You can avoid taking those risks by not going there or invoking the FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION RULE (spending 4 WT to skip the die roll)... but then your game will develop more slowly than those who accept the risk and dive in head-first.

[imageid=1784848 original]
[SIZE=29][b]10,000 DEAD[/b][/size]

So, dipping the tippy-toes in with our first game using all the new expansion rules but no modules—[i]yet[/i].  We&#039;ll add those in one after another for an experience snowball—[i]Bernals &amp; colonists, freighters, GW thrusters, Futures[/i]—to get both the full effect of each and to prolong the experience.  That means, what, like 12 plays before we&#039;re spun up to the full game?  Shucks, I guess we better get crackin&#039;.

Some notes from the first play:

• With the Income op at 2 and white cards selling for 4 out of the gate the economic system—so tight and shavey in the previous incarnation—is kinda bloated.  WT is easy to come by, speeding up the game and mitigating the effects of [i]crap-blowin&#039;-up[/i] but at the cost of tension.  I&#039;m imagining that this will tighten back up with all modules on. (?)

• Extropy via Events and triangle burns is [i]genius[/i]—definitely speeds things up.  It&#039;s cool to move, cycle a deck and then Research the next card.

• Having single factories poot out multiple black tech cards is TREMENDOUS.

• The new Solar Cycle is kinda brutal, with events kicking off every other round like clockwork.  I had a Martian resupply/rescue mission* get a hole punched in it [i]three times in a row[/i] from back-to-back CMEs and Space Debris.

♪ [i]That&#039;s High Frontier![/i] ♫

UPDATE:  I really like the Idea Turns to get things started quickly, though [b]I&#039;m still suspicious of how much bloat the full game will add[/b]—our Legacy games never went more than two hours, even with 5p and all Expansion modules on—and it would be a huge bummer if this tight, tense experience became an all-day sucker.

UP-UPDATE:  (6 plays)  Though it&#039;s been a rough start, I really like what [i]Colonization[/i] does.  It&#039;s got a ton story built into it, with an exponential arc of [i]explore-industrialize-colonize-ascend[/i].  There are real reasons to push politics, as well as to go to war.  (Operation Scrub the Space Pope, anyone?)   

It&#039;s ponderous and clumsy until you get the process of establishing dirtside Bernals down, but once you&#039;re there, it should sing.  (Much in the same way getting factories was initially so daunting in the base game, but once you got that down the game rolled hot.)

I get the impression that this might fit into a three-hour timeframe with experienced players and all modules on; at least I hope that things radically snowball once labs get built and everyone&#039;s promoting cards.  We shall see...


[size=7]*Yeah, people still get stranded on Mars in this one.  [i]Sigh.[/i]**[/size]


[size=5]**I know you&#039;re scratching your head and thinking, &quot;But Chris, that&#039;s a total rookie mistake—how the hell did that happen after 30-some-odd games?&quot;  And all I can say is that when you&#039;re the UN, your first patent is a solar sail, and Mars is open for business, you just kinda [i]go for it[/i].  It&#039;s not until you slide your Corvette into the valet lane at Chez Valles Marineris that you realize your hot date is just a blow-up doll filled with hydrazine.[/size]</comment>				</item>

[i]As a lifelong and eclectic gamer it&#039;s my favorite game of all time.[/i]

[center][size=18]⁂[/size][/center]
After bending your head far enough around the flagpole to be able to grok the base game, this one comes along and ties it in a knot.  And I mean that in the good way.

Nothing short of amazing, though the initial experience replaced the frustration of lack of funds with the frustration of a lack of tech that all worked nicely together.  Adding in supports—and the supports of the supports, as well as the need to radiate the increasing heat-load of those support-supports—was akin to buying pants by winning a pie-eating contest; eat enough pies and you win the pants...  That now don&#039;t fit.  So you eat more pies to get some new pants and you see where this is going.

Once you do manage to cobble together a rocket that works you just go with it—the only thing I ever optimized on my Frankenship was the robonaut.  I was afraid to monkey with anything else lest the whole thing bloat out and bust the seams in an undulating cascade of stuff needing more stuff.

All the tech that is magical and game-breaking in the base game (Zubrin, anyone?) is brutally balanced in the full game.  That thing burns [i]hot[/i] and even after dumping fuel through it as coolant you&#039;re gonna have to come up with [i]four more[/i] therms of cooling.  Also, the Metastable Helium thruster has a rad-hardness of zero, as in &quot;nope&quot;.  Suck it!

Fantastic, recommended, head-spinning—though only after the base game becomes too easy.  You really oughta play that five or so times before diving into this.

[After one play without Politics, Combat or Events (though we did keep Solar Flares/CMEs because watching the angry Sun decommission someone&#039;s thruster is hilarious).]

Play time still hovered around two hours, even with all the extra doohickeys.  [i]Nice.[/i]

UPDATE:  Gets better and better with each play.  We bust Luna as a matter of course and don&#039;t use Politics, Combat or Events (we do, however, execute Solar Flares/CMEs).  At some point I think I&#039;ll push for a &quot;full game&quot; with all options... and the Chinese.

UP-UPDATE:  Playing the full game now, with all rules on—Politics, Combat &amp; Events.  On paper it looks like it would make the game longer (losing cards from Glitch, Space Debris and Budget Cuts... as if Solar Flares weren&#039;t bad enough) but in actual play these things only happen a couple of times per game.  The rules overhead for all the extras is minimal and really pretty simple, with the end result being a tasty slathering of narrative.  (When a spanner going 30,000 kph scrubs someone&#039;s crew module out of LEO, well, what&#039;s not to like?)

I am glad we stair-stepped it, though:

- Base game to
- Expansion without Politics, Combat, or Events to
- Full game with all rules,

waiting until we were all comfortable (and eager for a little something extra) before adding the next bit.  For the life of me I can&#039;t imagine trying to learn Everything At Once as a n00b in a starter game.  [i]HF[/i] is truly a &quot;deep experience&quot; that requires familiarity and comfort with all the various details to realize its potential.

Rush it &amp; play once... have patience &amp; play for life!

[microbadge=23155]

Great at what it does—color recognition and matching with some minor min-max decision making.  I failed to score a single snake and yet I had a blast.

Lots of agonizing choices (&quot;I need to exhibit, and I know he knows I need to, which means I shouldn&#039;t, but, of course, he knows that, too, so he&#039;ll be expecting me not to.  Or will he?&quot;) and simultaneous play make for the fastest, sweatiest Great Dada Heist you&#039;ve ever experienced.  I guarantee you don&#039;t have anything like it in your collection.

We did this to give the wives a glimpse into our RPG life, and yea, they have stared into the Abyss...

The good news is they loved it!  Everyone dressed for the various parts, with one elegant lady even renting a costume for the occasion.  We dined on a very fancy dinner; everyone got into their roles and hammed it up.  In the end, one person had the solution, arrived at by actual sleuthing.

We are all looking very forward to playing one of these again!</comment>				</item>

UPDATE:  This is now referred to as the &quot;I&#039;m Not Your Friend Anymore Game&quot;.

UP-UPDATE:  Someone mean requested this at the last gamesday as a joke—knowing full well how much we all feared its power to upset and rile.  Turns out that if you come into it resolved not to take anything personally the game really shines.  It ends up being the &quot;thinking man&#039;s [gameid=140]&quot;.  I&#039;m glad to see the game redeemed and back in the rotation.</comment>				</item>

[BGCOLOR=#9999FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF][b]•[/b][/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]  LOLcat brain-states

[BGCOLOR=#9999FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF][b]•[/b][/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]  Weaponized malware that unpacks upon download, co-opts all resources in your local net, rehosts all your baseline neural functions inside every personally networked device, snow-crashes your brain and drives you around like it fucking stole it; you&#039;ll do porn and murder and murder-porn before it&#039;s done with you and dumps the body via suicide-by-cop.

UPDATE:  So far half the games have been hilarious FUBAR heists where:

• Everyone gets in slap-fights over the best Wi-Fi hot spots

• Someone finds out that while next year&#039;s Luv-Luv Bot™ model is only five-foot-three and cute as hell it weighs [i]more than 350 pounds[/i] and reverse-cowgirls like a pile driver, no, [i]really[/i]

• Most everyone gets shot in the leg

• One lucky bastard makes it out to the rainslick parking lot where he/she/it hotwires the minivan (because Mr. White—[i]God rest his soul[/i]—had the keys), and lays rubber onto the frontage road just in time to see the security merc APC get air off some parked cars and skid sideways across the wet asphalt, all six riot tires locked up—[i]making the slowpokes in the lobby dolly-zoom as they crap their pants[/i]—and ram the building in a shower of glass and gore...

And the other half have been completely dull.

The random factor means that when this baby gels it sets up hard and sweaty, and when it doesn&#039;t it&#039;s boring as hell.  I&#039;m gonna call it a six.

UP-UPDATE:  Because this game hinges on the random factor lining up [i]just so[/i]**, the variants where (1) each character starts with two preset item cards and (2) the card drafting mechanism for item selection [i]absolutely kill[/i] what makes this game work (some of the time).  If you know which items are in play, there are no outrageous surprises... and that&#039;s really all the game has going for it in the end.  Much better to have everyone start with four unknown bits of gear.  Only then can true hilarity ensue (some of the time).


[size=7]*Don&#039;t try to be clever—you&#039;ll only be plagiarizing the Master File.

**A high alarm count combined with high proximity rolls, as well as synergistic item cards.[/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>23</numplays>			<comment>Initial (pre-play) indications are good—a quick, light [i]D&amp;D[/i]-themed dice game.  Or is it [i]LCR[/i] with loose teeth?

UPDATE:  First play with the kids was fun—it&#039;s goofy, you get to roll lots of dice and knock chips off of each other&#039;s piles, and it has a hearty slug of [i]D&amp;D[/i] flavor.

UP-UPDATE:  A raucous role-playing romp!  This was the runaway hit of the last gamesday.  We played it at least eight times as a filler, two or three times through in a sitting, with much laughter and smack talk.  Absolutely achieves what it sets out to do...  and there&#039;s something deeply satisfying about taking a chair to a Halfling.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A not-awful just-before-bedtime-game where you collect sets of characteristics to capture cartoon animals, e.g., each animal has a type, color and number of dots that must be matched by cards in your hand.  A mechanism for stealing animals from other players is thrown in, as well as cards to prevent the theft.  The take-that/stealing mechanic can be frustrating for children—especially if through luck of the draw they don&#039;t have any (or not enough) of the anti-stealing cards.  Mercifully, the game has a built-in timer:  as soon as all 12 animals are captured, the game ends.  Table talk tends to swirl around whether the animals will be loved, eaten, or experimented on.

If you have trouble managing probability, hate player elimination or can&#039;t make serviceable giant monster battle sounds then stay away; otherwise know that it plays quickly and is a real hoot if everyone can get into the theme:

[microbadge=22861]  Full-throttle haymaker

[microbadge=22861][microbadge=22861]  Spartan-kicked through a city block

[microbadge=22861][microbadge=22861][microbadge=22861]  Clubbed with a nuclear aircraft carrier and raked with scintillating eye-beams

Note:  There are actually people alive who have never seen a Kaiju movie—not even [i]King Kong[/i].  When you say, &quot;You know, like Godzilla,&quot; they stare blankly and say, &quot;God-what?&quot;

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Technically it&#039;s a game (or should I say, &quot;game&quot;) that works just fine as a brief money-funnel into some lucky bastard&#039;s pocket.  When played for dollar coins or fifty-cent pieces it works, but just barely—be advised that there are no decisions (save to play or not to play) and there is no way of massaging the odds.  Playing for plastic chips is just plain stupid.  You might as well do coin-flips for air-kisses.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>After 6 plays:

I want to give this an 8 in the worst way—and I often come by here to do just that—but something&#039;s holding me back.

I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the player elimination—not something I normally have a problem with, as usually when people start dying the rest of the living aren&#039;t far behind, but sometimes one person will kick out early and for whatever reason the game will suddenly let up and enter a weird glide phase where things actually turn around, leaving the dead player with little to do other than dealing cards and sliding them around on the playmat forlornly.*

Or maybe it&#039;s that fragile variability where the card draws from the myriad decks conspire to make the game stutter between laughably easy and impossibly hard, with little rhyme or reason between either state.

It feels like it [i]wants[/i] to be a story game, but all the moving parts detract from that—and it&#039;s too swingy to function as a strategy game, stranding it in an ultimately unsatisfying limbo between the two.  It does neither well enough to really shine.

Also, the card art is hideously inconsistent, scribbling all over the map from cool/evocative to WTF/amateurish.


[size=7]*I suppose the &quot;Player Aliens&quot; advanced rule would solve this for those who die by chestburster, effectively accelerating the end, but what about the poor sap who died by other means?  And yeah, it&#039;s easy enough to houserule it so everyone who dies plays an alien, but that just feels like piling on... but maybe that&#039;s the whole point, right?  The only problem is that I&#039;m violently allergic to houserules.[/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Mostly harmless as a family game, but only if your kids are actually reading the books.  The cooperative aspect (it&#039;s the three orphans vs. Olaf, and sharing resources is vital for the orphans to win) makes the game more interesting than the usual roll-and-move WalMart fare.  Gorgeous production values in the version with the metal figures; the cards are especially, surprisingly, exquisite.

After seeing the elegant [i]Korsar[/i] version I wished I had a rusty, serrated hook hand so I could pull some art director&#039;s duodenum out through his farewell-sphincter.

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Gut-bustingly hilarious night-ender, especially if the players have all worked fast food jobs.  Can go on a little long with more than four players, though—easily fixed by playing fewer hands, like three max.

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>Very good.   Not only did this game pull in my non-gamer wife, it also piqued her interest in LotR in general, getting her into the movies and books!  Plays much better with the tiles in the bag from the Sauron expansion.

UPDATE:  I had forgotten just how great this game is—the ultimate party game for LotR-lovin&#039; game-nuts.

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>The best expansion for a great game.  Finally, after two other expansions, you get to assemble the Fellowship entire.  As has been stated ad nauseam elswhere, the battlefields are abstract flowcharts, a fact that bothered me at first—but all doubt fled as we commenced play.  We played two games back-to-back and I didn&#039;t even notice.  It felt very much like arraying troops for battle.  Shouts of &quot;Get Aragorn on the left flank,&quot; and &quot;We need Gandalf in there NOW!&quot; were common.  Cries of triumph erupted from the group when an enemy was supposed to be activated but was already dead or hemmed in by the warrior heroes of the Fellowship.  Likewise, the first time the Balrog turned up in Moria we crapped our pants.

What at first appears to be a Power Point presentation on the logic flow of an abstraction of a &quot;battle&quot; mechanic concept actually turns out to be the other five members of the Fellowship coming to the rescue, leading to real feelings of elation and dread as they give their all to delay the forces of darkness long enough to let the Hobbits run for their lives.

Highly recommended.

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>THIS BETTER NOT SUCK

UPDATE:  DOES NOT SUCK

After a weak-willed impulse buy at my FLGS and a single play, I&#039;m impressed.  The attention to detail on the physical design of the box and bits is breathtaking; the insert, especially, is a work of art.  Everything has a perfect place and comes out of that perfect place exactly the way you&#039;d expect it to—in other words, you reach for the thing and touch it and it hops out of its slot and into your hand.  This, in itself, is brilliant.  Like an amusement park for opposable thumbs.

As for those bits themselves, they are wonderfully tactile and gorgeous, like the gold pieces which, while unusually shaped (squares for singles and larger crescents for fives, all with a hole punched in the middle), are also double-sided with heads and tails having unique, baroque designs.  The card art is very good and goes a long way to immerse one in theme.

This is the first worker-placement/trade-crap-for-other-crap &quot;Euro&quot; that fulfilled my need for a li&#039;l somthin&#039; extra, namely to not get stuck thinking in terms of grinding for nibs to trade for nobs and then scoring for dinguses.  The &quot;take that&quot; cardplay is fun in a way that anal retentive geniuses cannot countenance; fair enough, but when I played &quot;Free Drinks!&quot; to lure a critical wizard away from another player&#039;s tavern and into my own I learned the folly of wizards too fond of the bottle—a return play of &quot;Arcane Mishap&quot; caused him to detonate during a &quot;spirited&quot; demonstration of magical power.  I was cleaning innards and singed beard bristles out of the crevices for [i]weeks[/i].

On the mechanical side the game is quick and breezy, with occasional bursts of multi-ply puzzling to keep it engaging.  I&#039;ve only played once, doing very poorly until the endgame where I managed to crawl into second place by paying attention to chaining opportunities while simultaneously dropping tactical turds into various punchbowls.  I enjoyed this very much.

There is a huge potential for variety in future plays, with more cards and buildings than opportunities to put them into play, as well as having them come out in a novel order each time.  Lucky synergies in one game could well be absent or significantly altered in the next.  How it all hangs together remains to be seen, but the obvious care, thought, and detail packed into it makes it an easy 8 for now. 

UP-UPDATE:  The second play had us all over the VP track coming into the final stretch; final score was 95-94-92-90.  Love it!

UP-UP-UPDATE:  After [-]11[/-] [-]12[/-] [-]13[/-] 14 plays, still going strong.  Yes, the &quot;secret&quot; scoring can be swingy, but really, it&#039;s not that secret (if you pay attention to what kind of quests your opponents are completing) and bank on all competent players getting somewhere around +30 points at the end.  Playing this with the same people means all our games have been annoyingly close... so much so I am getting sick and tired of LOSING BY ONE POINT.*

UP-UP-UP-UPDATE:  After 15 plays, bumping this to a well-deserved 9.  There is an enormous and non-obvious storytelling element lurking beneath all the mechanical meeple-swapping... Open yourself to it.  And then send those poor bastards to their DOOM.

[q=&quot;D&amp;D flavor? You get out what you put in...&quot;][floatright][imageid=1533570 small][/floatright]
The half-headed man and his apprentice sauntered into Aurora&#039;s Realms Shop to the tinkle of fine Elven bells.  The apprentice locked the door behind them.

&quot;We&#039;re here for our money, luv,&quot; croaked Half-Head.  

Aurora startled, looking up from her ledger, eyes wide.  &quot;But you people were just here!&quot;  Behind the counter, a baby cooed in its basket.

Half-Head gurgled, the only part of his laugh not taken by fire or hatchet.  &quot;That was then.  This is now.&quot;

&quot;I-I-&quot; Aurora stammered, &quot;I don&#039;t have it!&quot;

&quot;Stab the baby,&quot; said Half-Head.  The apprentice hesitated for a split-second, then unsheathed a rude-looking dagger.

&quot;Oh, Gods!  No!&quot; Aurora shrieked.

&quot;Easy, luv,&quot; said Half-Head, &quot;you&#039;ve plenty of healing potion here.  The baby&#039;ll be fine.  But [i]you[/i], you need to learn a lesson...&quot;[/q]
[b]21 PLAYS LATER:  MANDATORY QUESTS AIN&#039;T A THANG[/b]

I have won plenty of games where I was dogpiled with Mandatory Quests... [size=7]of course, I&#039;ve lost just as many, too.[/size]

The only reason they make your forehead veins stand out as you poop yourself a little is because [i]you didn&#039;t plan for them.[/i]  Always assume Mandatory Questage and prepare for it, whether by salting away materiel or factoring an action/turn cushion into all of your plans—[i]especially the critical ones.[/i]  Ending up in the embarrassingly pantsless position of only having exactly what you need to pull off that 25-pointer at the very end and getting royally hosed by a single small Mandatory Quest is not a design flaw or a moral failing of the person who played the card—[i]the fault is entirely your own.[/i]

PS.  Pimped with [boardgameaccessory=145782]DnDeeples[/boardgameaccessory].  A mandatory addition if you ask me.


[size=7]*Especially when there&#039;s a bunch of table bumping and bag switching going on with the VP markers:  &quot;Oh, I&#039;m sorry—[i]you&#039;re[/i] blue?  Where were you again?&quot;  And BANG lose by one point.[/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>This looks like an insta-win with just more of what makes [i]Waterdeep[/i] a great game—top-notch art and production values*, as well as solid gameplay that&#039;s pregnant with opportunities for lordly shenanigans and emergent narrative—but only time and actual plays will tell.

At this point I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ll only want to play the modules separately and just ignore the variant where you play everything all at once.  Part of the base game&#039;s charm is in its sweet concision—playing a 6-player, all-bells-and-whistles &quot;long game&quot; is probably like trying to drink an entire bathtub of maple syrup.

[b]Undermountain[/b] — 3 plays

Just as quick and tense as the base game, with players adapting easily to the new material.  Two 40-point Quests were scored despite Mandatory Questage (horrors!) and scores were higher in general—yet it was still a close game with the victor only squeezing the win by a single point.  [i]Nice.[/i]

[b]Skullport[/b] — 1 play


[size=7]*Yeah, the cards aren&#039;t the same size as the original game and that makes [i]real[/i] shuffling a bit of a thing... but it&#039;s such a minor annoyance for one who poops in clean drinking water daily.[/size]

I won the first game as she was coming to grips with the new mechanics, then lost the second game soundly in what I expect will become my lot in this game...

[i]And all that gin back at the Explorer&#039;s Club does nothing to silence the screams of my men...[/i]

UPDATE:  What a great, tense game.  As much as I enjoy it as a 2-player with my wife &amp; a glass of wine (fine babe + fine wine + fine game = fine time) it really shines as a 4-player... shines like the glint off a scalpel &#039;neath the harsh lights of an operating theater with leather straps and no anesthesiologist.  Maybe you can get a leg free and kick but no one&#039;s gonna hear you scream.

The winner of each round earns a &quot;token of affection&quot;, a little red cube that most assuredly does not represent chlamydia or herpes.

UPDATE:  This game is about 9,000 times more fun than it has any right to be—16 cards and some cubes?  Passing notes to a princess?  [i]Really?[/i]  But the end result is a quick, light farce that really does feel like scurrying through gardens and halls, of tarrying in chambers at improper hours, all on the little cat feet of whispers and meaningful glances.

The genius of the game comes from the small set of interactions possible with the cards, making the deduction element satisfying enough for the time frame involved (read:  short &amp; sweet).  Were it any more vexing or longer it would be a failure—but [i]Love Letter[/i] is a bonbon of precise proportions, mild and delicious.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This is one of those &quot;Huh—is that all there is?&quot; games.  If you look at the action that takes place on a single board across a single turn, it&#039;s really a lot simpler than it looks.  What bulks the game up into hulking-behemoth-of-German-gaming status is the fact that you&#039;ll be playing on four boards simultaneously across seven rounds.  Much in the a same way that a full game of Go is more than just four 9x9 games at the same time, a full game of [i]Die Macher[/i] will bend your head to its outer limits as you attempt to do the cognitive push-pull on a bazillion cardboard levers for five hours.

I don&#039;t feel qualified to throw an official rating on it after just one play; unofficially I&#039;d give it a 7 or an 8—I&#039;m not really sure right now.  I was underwhelmed at first by the idea that it was just many iterations of the same mechanics over and over with little variation.  I find myself, however, unable to stop thinking about it, much like after finding out the homely girl in your eighth grade class is a fantastic kisser...  It definitely loses points for the fact that it takes five hours and requires a quorum of five players who get all frothy at the idea of spending an entire afternoon LARPing German electoral politics.  I&#039;d like to play it several more times to get a better idea of exactly how I feel about it, but that&#039;s going to be hard to do more than once a year or so.  Perhaps I&#039;ll have an answer within the next five years.  See you then. 

UPDATE:  Had a better handle on things after a second play, but since it took place a year after the first one, it still felt like a learning game.  On the theme side I really love how cynical (and realistic) the game is:  instead of having the different parties take principled stances on issues, everyone is fighting for the middle, flip-flopping like crazy to maximize vote count.</comment>				</item>

[i]The best hobby game ever made.  Period.[/i]

My favorite thing about [i]Magic[/i] is that it is a game with literally thousands of pieces, all capable of interacting with each other in amazing and surprising ways; this fact allows a player to truly &quot;play their personality&quot; like no other game does.  [i]Magic[/i] does an incredible job of evoking its theme—wizards duelling with magic spells—by having you first craft a library of spells (your deck) and then &quot;remembering&quot; them (drawing cards during a game).  There is a big HOWEVER, however:  the game is best when played in a controlled environment where all players have access to the same number of cards, e.g., limiting card purchases to a predetermined number of decks and boosters.  [i]Magic[/i] breaks down horribly when the arms race spirals out of control and then the rich kid wins.  The very assets that make the game like no other are also the problems that plague and break it...  And yet I&#039;ve played it weekly since &#039;94, and will continue to do so.

PS.  This is the only CCG that actually makes sense as a CCG, that is, the mechanical act of drawing and playing cards is akin to flipping through the pages of a spellbook.

PPS.  The hands-down best way to play if you don&#039;t want to get into the collecting aspect is to buy a couple of pre-constructed decks.

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>So apparently you&#039;re supposed to say what your spell is for (whether this is in the rules-as-written or a capricious house rule, I do not know) and as the turn-taking progressed around the gathering of competitors the goals of the spells were various:

&quot;Rainbow underpants.&quot;

&quot;A pony.&quot;

&quot;To fly.&quot;

When it got to me I said my spell was &quot;to thin the veil between our world and the void dimension of Gnlorthrax Thousandlegs, to sunder His chains, loosen His cavernous blowholes and prod Him to bellow my name into little children&#039;s dreams—[i]forever[/i].&quot;

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>As far as Rummy-style shenanigans go, this one&#039;s tops.  The raw game inside is semi-mediocre—I&#039;m not sure how much fun it would be with cards, for instance.  But those tiles make it!  Washing, building the walls, drawing stacks, arranging and monkeying around with them—it&#039;s a treat for the senses.*

Recommended as a social couples&#039; game.

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>As [thing=66356]Wrath of Ashardalon[/thing] is to [family=190][/family], so [i]Mansions of Madness[/i] is to [family=310]Call of Cthulhu[/family].

Both board games maintain the general theme while stripping out the free-form role-playing elements by reducing player actions to a small set of discrete choices.  The end result is a feel similar to the mechanical surface of the source role-playing games, allowing the players to tell shallow stories without the usual RPG prep-time overhead.  (Veteran RPGers will scoff at this, and they should, since experienced players can whip up a far deeper and more satisfying game in moments with nothing more than [i]paper-pencils-dice[/i] and the Magic of [COLOR=#CC0000]Im[/COLOR][COLOR=#FF6633]ag[/COLOR][COLOR=#FFCC33]in[/COLOR][COLOR=#00CC00]at[/COLOR][COLOR=#0033FF]ion[/COLOR].)

That said, [i]Mansions of Madness[/i] *is* the [i]D&amp;D[/i] board game version of [i]Call of Cthulhu[/i], with all the wonder and nerd-rage that such an eldritch mash-up implies.  Monsters are there for shooting at, and not as a last resort...  It&#039;s best to ignore the two-fisted comic book treatment of the source material and just enjoy it for what it is.

It&#039;s a board game opportunity to engage in a plot with clues, puzzles, and—if you&#039;re lucky—a broken leg and suicide.

The combat cards are nifty; when a player says, &quot;I&#039;m shooting at the thing at the end of the hallway,&quot; it&#039;s rarely a simple Marksmanship test—the player can miss and hurt themselves in the process or find the thing suddenly right next to them.  And even when you &quot;win&quot; you can wind up dead in the process.

[b]A note to future Keepers:[/b]  [i]The story portion of the game really shines when players narrate their actions with a bit of detail—encourage this.  Also, it really helps if you embellish and customize the flavor text on the cards.  When fighting a cultist, for example, replace all references to the foe with &quot;cultist&quot; and have him or her do and say &quot;culty&quot; things.  The game more than meets you halfway on this stuff, but if you can supply the other half it&#039;s a full-blown hoot.[/i]

The game is lavishly produced, with miniatures that actually beg to be painted.  (Disregard the &quot;chicken leg&quot; Shoggoths and Mi-Gos masquerading as the Hamburgler.)  Also, it&#039;s not nearly as complicated as the rule book would have you believe.  It&#039;s refreshingly simple compared to [thing=15987]Arkham Horror[/thing].

After one play I&#039;m giving it an 8—though I expect the rating to rise with more plays.  We&#039;re all inveterate hams and lifelong RPGers, so this drubs all the right nubbins for us.

UPDATE:  Sure enough, this game is great.  The only thing holding the rating back from shooting to an auto-10 is the fragile nature of the interlocking systems.  They&#039;re all neat, but a single error in one place can cascade through and break the game, usually to the detriment of the Investigators.  (Small mistakes magnify as the game progresses.  In our first two games the win came down to time management, and early errors in movement rates meant the Investigators couldn&#039;t win.  Familiarity with the systems should mitigate this.)  This forces the players to slew hard left into RPG territory and hand-wave the issue away in order to save the game, something that feels unnatural and suspect in a board game.

Also, the puzzle mechanic is genius fun.  It&#039;s not that the puzzles are challenging—they&#039;re pretty simple—but I&#039;m a huge fan of props from the game world made actual size.  The result is a nice bit of immersion.

UP-UPDATE:  Revising upward to a 9.  Our last two games have been real nailbiters, literally hanging on a final die roll.  Both times the narrative elements narrowed to a satisfying climax for all players—when this game works, it works really, really well.  Fantastic system.

Gets me in a way that [GAMEID=551] could not, as I lack the American Civil War gene.  The game engine is excellent—a beer-n-pretzels wargame for those of us who are not hardcore wargamers.

UPDATE:  Yeah, it&#039;s just playin&#039; with plastic army men.  But sometimes that&#039;s all you need.

[size=15]as [COLOR=#FF0000][i]BAM[/i][/COLOR] &amp; [COLOR=#FF0000][i]BLANG![/i][/COLOR][/b][/size][/floatleft][/center]
UP-UPDATE:  As I close in on 40 plays I suppose I must bump this to a 9; my interest is only accelerating and as a game system there is just so much to love here.  And while it might seem like a &quot;heavily-themed abstract&quot; the sheer number of units, options, and scenarios makes every game unique.

Almost every scenario is wildly imbalanced (a nod to history), making any single play unsatisfying for someone; but when you consider a single match to be two games with the victor having the highest total medal count after playing both the favorite and the underdog, well, then the experience is very satisfying indeed.  As the favorite you want to run that steamroller to victory as quickly as possible and minimize the underdog&#039;s score; as the underdog you want to simply last as long as possible and rack up as many medals as you can before you&#039;re snuffed.  On the odd occasion when the underdog actually [i]wins[/i]?  Then it&#039;s time to dance around the table and flick infantry units at the loser.

Hand management, probability, and the sequencing of attacks are all neat puzzles that keep each turn interesting, even when you&#039;re the one getting pounded.  And the whole time the setup just looks gorgeous.

There are more scenarios than I can probably get through in a lifetime... though I&#039;ll give it my best shot!

UP-UP-UPDATE:  It&#039;s a 10, earned the hard way—through ever-increasing game-pleasure.  The best scenarios from the expansions are engaging puzzles that not only bear repeat play, but unfold before you into larger and larger possibility spaces the more experience you get with them.  Some feel as if you could play them endlessly without ever becoming bored*—the static setup is a puzzle that requires a dynamic solution, depending wholly on the interaction between how the cards come out, hedging dice probabilities, and your creativity in manipulating it all.  Grinding the same scenario over and over is less about finding the optimal path (and solving it for all time) than it is about finding the way through the unique iteration right in front of you, right now.

Cards, dice, plastic army men, a historical veneer and functionally infinite replayability—this is very nearly the perfect game.


[size=7]*Yes, I know this isn&#039;t true—but the subjective sensation of infinite fun propels me onward.  Besides, should I be so lucky as to actually &quot;wear one out&quot; there are only a couple hundred more to dig into...[/size]</comment>				</item>

UPDATE:  The 2006 &quot;Made in China&quot; edition is a significant step down in production quality after the 2004 &quot;Made in Germany&quot; one.

:soblue:  The box has a cheap, plasticky finish instead of a nice linen one.

:soblue:  The dice are painted instead of embossed.

:soblue:  The printing on the cards, board and tiles is washed out and less distinct.

Looks like everything&#039;s cheaper in China, and it shows.

UP-UPDATE:  While I rate M&#039;44 a 10 overall, this edition gets a 7 for production &quot;values&quot;.</comment>				</item>

I really don&#039;t know what else to say.  I mean, [i]46[/i] new scenarios—that&#039;s more than twice the plays that even the most ardent fan would get out of a &quot;favorite&quot; game.  Should you manage to wear this book out you&#039;d be a master of M&#039;44.  Even if you lost every match.

For any given single scenario there&#039;s only one way to play, and that&#039;s twice, once as each side and then comparing total medals from both games for the win (this handles the historical &quot;balance issue&quot;).  But for the game system as a whole the only way to play, really, is campaign mode, and man, this book delivers potential [i]years[/i] of replay value.

Currently dipping our toes into the &quot;Island Hoppers&quot; Grand Campaign and we couldn&#039;t be happier—not even if we had magic motorcycles that gave Nirvana-inducing blowjobs and shat gold coins.  No sir.

PS.  Oh, yeah—and an entire [thing=68752]Breakthrough[/thing] campaign in Normandy, to boot?

[size=7]Fig. 1 — [i]&quot;Shall we spread a little alarm and despondency?&quot;[/i][/size][/center]
UPDATE:  Played scenarios 4-8 as a campaign (using the rules included with the Winter/Desert Board) and the attrition dice between rounds made for some interesting decisions.  In at least one instance, they directly helped the whipping-boy underdog score a stunning victory.

Details here:

[b][thread=815696][/thread]

[thread=818481][/thread][/b]

UP-UPDATE:  After playing through the Battle of Gazala campaign a second time I&#039;m convinced that this is what the expansion is all about.  The first three scenarios get you used to the new units and rules so you can dive into the full campaign.  The fact that the five connected scenarios can be played to completion in three hours makes for a fantastic evening with scads of drama &amp; narrative potential.

I figured that after we played both sides we&#039;d be done with it, but I find myself wondering if I couldn&#039;t do better and am itching to puzzle out the problems inside the five battles again.  And again.

From here on out, &quot;playing Med Theater&quot; means doing the Gazala campaign in one go, flipping roles in the following session &amp; comparing scores.

The experience completely blows away single-scenario play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>24</numplays>			<comment>Wow.  Just... [i]wow[/i].  Everything about this set is completely off the charts.  The art on the terrain hexes is gorgeous and evocative, the winter rules make the game feel exactly like you&#039;d expect—vehicles are slowed and you can&#039;t see much of anything beyond immediate contact.  You can fire into the fog and hope for the best, or you can maneuver into close combat and savage each other.  Tense and brutal.

The Winter Combat cards add a [i]huge[/i] amount of thematic immersion and crazy turns of event.  I have watched what should have been dramatic, game-winning turns ([i]Their Finest Hour[/i]) end up completely repulsed and negated by a couple of flopped Winter cards.  [i]Out of Fuel, Out of Ammo[/i], and, oh, an [i]Ambuscade[/i], to boot!  Sorry &#039;bout your offensive, there.

	<numplays>36</numplays>			<comment>Like Hitler and Napoleon, now you too can experience the joys of Russian winter.

UPDATE:  Sure, it&#039;s cosmetic—but damn, does it ever look good.  And the nation-specific medals (Victoria Cross on the desert side &amp; the Hero of the Soviet Union on the winter side) add that extra little bit.

The campaign rules that come with the board seem wonky at first glance—with no hope for anything approaching balance—but in actual play they work great.  We played scenarios 4-8 from the Mediterranean Theater as a campaign and the attrition dice between rounds made for some interesting decisions, and, in at least one instance, directly helped the whipping-boy underdog score a stunning victory.

If you want campaign rules that are better balanced and more robust, go with one of the Campaign books; otherwise this works just fine for linking three, four or five scenarios into an unbalanced night of great, narrative fun.

This is, after all, a Sgt. Rock comic, not Churchill&#039;s [i]Memoirs of the Second World War[/i].

UP-UPDATE:  Now that we&#039;re into [gameid=84406] I must reiterate my assessment of how effing gorgeous this looks when it&#039;s all set up.  One glance and you&#039;re helplessly drawn into the magic circle... I swear it makes me want to put on a sweater it looks so cool.</comment>				</item>

Still, like the recitation of a demon resurrection passage, it&#039;s loose and hinky, requiring on-the-fly rules adjudication and eventual house-ruling to work smoothly and well.  If you&#039;re inclined to tinker, have at it.  Otherwise, well, it&#039;s a five.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>A nice fat wad of steam-powered chaos.  It&#039;s a lot like trying to fly a coal-fired spaceship—kinda rickety, kinda scary, and with really dodgy yaw control.  I&#039;m a fan of these sorts of contraptions where your goal is to build a house of cards while everyone is taking turns punching you in the head.  Overheard at the first playing:  &quot;It&#039;s like [i]Citadels[/i] but it doesn&#039;t suck!&quot;  (For the record, I like [i]Citadels[/i], but I think I&#039;m the only one in my group who does.)  So if you&#039;re in the mood for a lighter, chaotic, highly-thematic romp, this one gets it done full steam ahead.  

Throw up some wheat-paste signage, hire a barker or two and pack those suck—er, [i]intrepid adventurers[/i]—into the Jules Verne Express and blast their asses to Mars!</comment>				</item>

I was highly suspicious.  Then I played it.  It&#039;s crap all right—HOLY CRAP.  Holy Crap that is only to be taken out of its reliquary by the blessed hands of one who has been blinded by the fires of God&#039;s face and borne to the gaming table on the backs of nubile, yet coyly attired, virgins.

	<numplays>22</numplays>			<comment>The classic children&#039;s game where good play is actually opaque to children, while the thing itself is a poster child for monopolistic IP fraud.

[microbadge=16638] [b]MWAHAHAHA![/b]

UPDATE:  Truth be told, I&#039;ve only ever played a single &quot;proper&quot; game of [i]Monopoly[/i] with adults—a Star Wars edition on Halloween 1999.  I freely admit that I rather enjoyed it; in fact, everyone present did.  All other plays have been with children, which means they were either unnaturally truncated or &quot;thrown&quot;.

[b]EDITIONS OWNED (4.5):[/b]

[b][gameid=13154][/b] (1954, sans board)
:star::star::star::halfstar::nostar:
Complete with the funky-shaped wooden pawns.  Hopefully the metal bits that should have come with this got shot into a Nazi somewhere.

[-][b][gameid=7098][/b][/-]
:star::star::star::halfstar::nostar:
A decent set, though the carousel for the deed cards is an attractive nuisance—every couple minutes somebody just has to see if they can spin it hard enough to make properties fly everywhere.

[b][gameid=1298][/b]
:star::star::halfstar::nostar::nostar:
&quot;Yoda&#039;s hut is a dump.  Took a blaster to the squatters, had to fumigate for midi-chlorians.  Repurposed it as a Bothan slum.  And they&#039;re all pigs for death sticks, so I&#039;m rollin&#039; in it.&quot;

[-][b][gameid=5472][/b][/-]
:star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar:
Got handed this by someone who got handed it and didn&#039;t want it.  I didn&#039;t want it either, but everyone ran out of the room.

[b][gameid=2929][/b]
:star::star::halfstar::nostar::nostar:
Self-purchased for five bucks &amp; converted into an [url=http://www.gamecabinet.com/rules/Illuminopoly.html]Illuminopoly[/url] set.  Second best possible use for it.

[b][gameid=7180][/b]
:star::star::star::halfstar::nostar:
Self-purchased for family.  Upgraded with antique dice for that &quot;Olde Tyme&quot; feel.  This is the copy I reach for when the kids demand to play.

[-][b][gameid=8041][/b][/-]
:star::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar:
Received as a gift because I&#039;m &quot;that game guy.&quot;  The theme just plain does not work.

[-][b][gameid=18895][/b][/-]
:star::star::star::halfstar::nostar:
Self-purchased in hopes it would be a nicer version than the Nostalgia Edition.  It isn&#039;t.  That said, it is the only set where the art &amp; theme (Roaring &#039;20s Art Deco) actually match the gameplay.

[b]Updated Standard Edition[/b] (2008)
:star::star::star::halfstar::nostar:
The standardized edition with Baltic and Mediterranean in brown (instead of purple), Luxury Tax at $100 (instead of $75), Income Tax at a flat $200 (no more 10% option), and the rewritten rulebook.  The Title Deeds, Community Chest and Chance cards all came as a single deck of Bridge-sized cards, which is nice.  The new rulebook is especially good, though—very streamlined, straightforward, and modern.

[b]The Speed Die is total pants.[/b]  It takes the nice bell curve of 2d6 and distorts it to the breaking point.  A key feature of [i]Monopoly[/i] is being able to bet on seven—for yourself, and, most importantly, the financial man-traps you lay for your opponents.

UP-UPDATE:  Replaying, rethinking, rerating up to a 7.

[b]THE GAME IS INTOLERABLE WITH HOUSE RULES[/b]  

The biggest problem with [i]Monopoly[/i] (other than the fact that it works best as a distraction from hunger pangs and general squalor) is that it&#039;s taught through oral tradition rather than anyone actually sitting down and reading the rules.

With the most common house rules (money on Free Parking &amp; no auctions or real trading) it becomes the world&#039;s longest, dumbest game of craps.  And that&#039;s a rightfully hateful thing.

As many have noted, played [i]by the rules as written[/i] (auctions) with four sufficiently self-interested adults (shrewd yet fearless trading), it ends up being a perfectly fine, fun game that plays inside of 90 minutes.

Especially if you end at the second bankruptcy.  Which you should, as the contest between the final two comes down to nothing but a dice-off that takes forever as they swap wads of cash back and forth.

Of course, the real problem is that there are so many great games for four players this classic won&#039;t get any table time.

Moral:  [i]Always bet on seven![/i]


Bell curve with the newfangled &quot;Speed Die&quot;*:

[c]             [/c][i]i[/i]
[c]           7 ?
        6 heee 7 8 13

(2) 3 4 N 6 7 8 9 snizz 10 11 * 14 o[/c]

Moral:  [i]The winner will be the first one who doesn&#039;t roll Mr. Monopoly at the end.[/i]


[b]Speed Die rules:[/b]

[b]1, 2, 3[/b] — Add to your normal move; does not count for doubles but on a triple A GATE APPEARS and you are sucked through and delayed.

[b]Bus[/b] — Realize that though you are wealthy you are suddenly using public transportation; nearly die of shame &amp; hand sanitizer poisoning.

[b]Mr. Monopoly[/b] — If any properties unowned, proceed to nearest unowned property and buy or auction it; if all properties owned, eat an enormous sack of feces, suddenly and unexpectedly (well, you can bet on a 1 in 3 chance of this every roll, but still, this takes what little skill there is in the game, eats it and poops it into a sack).

[i]Bon appétit![/i]

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Ingenious for what it is:  a ubiquitous license slapped all over a not-bad set-collection game with heavy &quot;take that&quot; elements.  It&#039;s [i]Monopoly[/i] as played by the masses who don&#039;t bother to read the proper rules and learn it instead by way of ritual and oral tradition—far less a proper trading game and more as a set-collection/bleed-&#039;em-out death march—compressed into 10 minutes.

So, is it [i]Monopoly[/i]?  No, but it is the distilled essence of how most people play the game.  And that&#039;s where this thing is weirdly perfect.

Rating reflects play with kids &amp; family.</comment>				</item>

- by the rules as written
- with four adults
- ending at the second bankruptcy.

Curiously, none of the elements reflect the real zeitgeist—the paranoia of religious End Times mixing like crap-n-vomit with the carpet-bagging shitsacks who gorged themselves on the Y2K Bug hoax.  (Now THAT&#039;S a Monopoly theme if I ever heard one!)  

The prismatic foil board is migraine-inducing and the translucent money, while funny at first, is far less effective than nice paper would have been.  The money also holds grease stains rather well.

I rate the base game a 7 when played:

- by the rules as written
- with four adults
- ending at the second bankruptcy.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Outside of the theme, the equipment for this version is super sweet—the title deeds are pasteboard tabs that slot into the board, making it easy to see what&#039;s owned and what&#039;s up for grabs; the snap-in hotels and houses are nifty, though you have to be gentle with them; and the raised plastic board creates a natural arena in the center for dice-chucking.

But then there&#039;s that whole theme thing... no blind hate for [i]Phantom Menace[/i] here; I&#039;m just a purist when it comes to Monopoly.  All the crazy re-skinning of the base game detracts from the entirely appropriate and well-integrated Roaring Twenties feel of the original.  I want gin, jazz and flappers—not blue milk, forlorn symphonic swells and Droids—with my financial dickery.

The idea of Frodo buying Mount Doom becomes a recursive negative feedback loop arcing ever-larger bolts of purple lightning between the whirling triad of monopolistic capitalism, franchise licensing, and the realities of Tolkien&#039;s work.  Oh, the pain.

	<numplays>38</numplays>			<comment>[b]tl;dr[/b] — When played by 3 or 4 RPG geeks inside 45 minutes (utilizing all &quot;Faster Play&quot; Rules) this is an absolute lark as a storytelling/party game; with the wrong number of the wrong people with the wrong mindset in the wrong timeframe it&#039;s absolute hell.

[size=10][BGCOLOR=#FFCC66][COLOR=#663300][b]O[/b][/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size][COLOR=#663300]nce upon a time, when I was 13, we played [i]D&amp;D[/i] all night long at a slumber party.  Around midnight we killed the whiniest kid&#039;s character, took all his magic stuff, drew a pentagram on his chest with Hershey&#039;s Chocolate Syrup (in the handy squeeze bottle) and threw him into the swimming pool.  [i]Munchkin[/i] is exactly like that.  ~[/COLOR]

[size=12][b][i]Munchkin[/i] is a party game.[/b][/size]

[i]Whether it&#039;s fun or not depends entirely on the group.[/i]  

It&#039;s a stupid-fun activity, not a strategy game where players capable of 4D chess will prevail.  Dumb luck and above-the-table whining have far more to do with who wins than skill or intellect.*  Yes, the jokes are lowbrow and get old.**  The standard rules can make the game overstay its welcome by a factor of 10.  But with the right group and right mindset this is good fun inside of 45 minutes.  Just add beer, pretzels and a sailor&#039;s vocabulary.

[size=12][b]It&#039;s fun as long as it&#039;s fun.[/b][/size]

[i]Kill it when it turns.[/i]

[i]Munchkin[/i]&#039;s fatal flaw is game length.  It kicks ass for about 30 minutes, and then everybody starts to get antsy, looking for the end that never seems to come—a cool, refreshing wave that rises up and curls white with feathery tips of sweet release... only to recede again as someone thwarts someone else&#039;s lunge for Level 10.  Over.  And over.  [i]And over[/i]...  Until someone finally sneaks an exhausted win and the game is unceremoniously forearm-wiped back into the box and hurled into the closet to cries of &quot;Why did you make us play that?&quot; and &quot;Never again—no, I [i]really mean it[/i] this time.&quot;

[COLOR=#CC0033][b]SUDDEN ASIDE:[/b]  [i]A Note to Designers.[/i]  Every game is only good for so long—find out where that is and then design your game to come to a satisfying conclusion juuust under that threshhold.  This will make people cry &quot;Let&#039;s do that again!&quot;, shuffle up and go—instead of &quot;Thank God [i]that&#039;s[/i] over,&quot; shuffle off and [i]go[/i].  Think of it as analogous to the physical limitations of masturbation and you&#039;re on the right track.[/COLOR]

So, can [i]Munchkin[/i] reach a satisfying climax before chafing sets in?  It can, but most of the time it doesn&#039;t.  Hideous time dilation lurks deep in its DNA—everything possible must be done to prevent its expression.

Here&#039;s what we do:

[b]1.  Play with 3 or 4 players [i]only[/i].[/b]
With 5 it&#039;s a grind; 6 is miserable.  Keep it short and sweet with fewer players.

[b]2.  Use the most current version of the rules.[/b]
Four Doors &amp; four Treasures as the starting hand (and when returning from death).

[b]3.  Use ALL &quot;Faster Play&quot; Rules.[/b]
Add [i]Phase 0—Listen At The Door[/i]; [i]Loot The Room[/i] for a Treasure instead of a Door; win is shared with helper, regardless of helper&#039;s level.

[b]4.  Start at Level 2 (or 3!).[/b]
Why not?  Munchkin, &amp;c.

[b]5.  Time limit/call it the moment it blows.[/b]
We usually play to 30 minutes, maybe 45 if it&#039;s a particularly good session.  But the moment anyone is not enjoying themselves and would rather do anything else, we call it after one more round (The [gameid=3837] Rule).  If no one hits Level 10 by then the winner is determined by highest total combat bonus from cards in play, with level as a tiebreaker.

[microbadge=1358]

The &quot;dirty&quot; OG set for camping &amp; unwashed children:

[GAMEID=1927] (2003 printing)
[GAMEID=3943]
[GAMEID=6606]

This is the BEST setup—just enough variation without any excess bloat.  It&#039;s also my favorite set from a good-times/nostalgic-pizza-grease perspective.

[size=7]*Not entirely true.  There is a [i]teeensy bit[/i] of strategy in building a hand and tableau that can threaten a sudden win from Level 6 if you know what you&#039;re doing...

**The intended audience—RPG nerds &amp; the con crowd—actually appreciate the repetition.[/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>38</numplays>			<comment>[i]Munchkin[/i] is not a strategy game.  It will not work for those who must clench a bolus of control in their anal retentive sphincters.  

It&#039;s a social interaction coupling device.  

It&#039;s a party game.  

In that regard it does a decent job and gets anywhere from a 5 on up to a 10, depending on the group dynamic.

It&#039;s best when played inside 45 minutes by 3 or 4 goofy, old-school fantasy RPGers.

If you really, [i]really[/i] like [i]Munchkin[/i], this, along with [gameid=6606], are the only two &quot;must-have&quot; expansions.  They add a decent amount of variation (and good humor) without game-crippling bloat.  Everything else beyond these two only makes sense if you actually [i]are[/i] a Munchkin, your players froth at the mouth for it, and every session leaves you dry-heaving from laughter.

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>If you really, [i]really[/i] like [i]Munchkin[/i], this, along with [gameid=3943], are the only two &quot;must-have&quot; expansions.  They add a decent amount of variation (and good humor) without game-crippling bloat.  Everything else beyond these two only makes sense if you actually [i]are[/i] a Munchkin, your players froth at the mouth for it, and every session leaves you dry-heaving from laughter.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Adds two new kinds of cards (steeds &amp; hirelings) along with mechanics and support cards for dealing with each.  The only issue is that when included with the previous two expansions we end up with a prodigious amount of deck dilution, making actual synergy a rare thing.

It also smothers the beautiful symmetry of having one hireling ([i]the[/i] Hireling) and one &quot;Kill the Hireling&quot; card.  (And, yes, I pull the second hireling from [i]Clerical Errors[/i] to maintain that delicate dance between predator and prey.)

I leave out steeds &amp; hirelings entirely as they just seem to gum up the works; also removed cards deemed &quot;stupid, but without the funny&quot;.  I&#039;m probably using about half of this.  The humor gets pretty thin after the third expansion...

Pulled out everything having to do with rangers, steeds &amp; hirelings—it&#039;s just too much when mixed in with 2 &amp; 3.  Maybe 4 &amp; 5 would work best with their own base set... Maybe.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>The global-effect dungeons are cool, flavorful, and actually speed up the game (a Good Thing).  Sure, the Portal cards will get lost in massive decks, but you can always shuffle them into the top 150-or-so or just do the &quot;discard four cards&quot; trick to change dungeons.  (Or houserule it to three if four is too onerous.)

Pulled out everything having to do with rangers, steeds, hirelings, centaurs and lizard guys.  That left less than half the set, but still enough nifty cards to make it worthwhile.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[b]tl;dr[/b] — A good version of the game for hardcore fans of the show, but otherwise impenetrable.  If you have doubts about either it ain&#039;t for you.

Now, if you&#039;re [i]me[/i], you&#039;d rate this game something mathematical like GOOGOLHEXAPETILLION!!! but that&#039;s only because the acid flashbacks finally allow you to understand the language of donuts [size=7][1][/size], pick up your sword [size=7][2][/size], wade into the dungeon [size=7][3][/size] and collect pelts [size=7][4][/size] as the wailing guitars shred space and time. [size=7][5][/size]
 
If you&#039;re [i]not[/i] me, then I dunno.  It&#039;s slightly better than vanilla [i]Munchkin[/i], being generally more creative and playful*, and the move toward iconography is nice.  That should put it at a 7.62 or something, but the [i]Adventure Time[/i] theme is pretty narrow, so it loses 1.49 points for that.**  Math!

The extra cards are great, but a bunch of the dungeons look like they&#039;ll actually [i]increase[/i] play time (!) with global effects that strip levels and items, as well as adding &quot;death&quot; to the Bad Stuff of every monster...

Ennui-inducing play time dilation is the fatal flaw of every [i]Munchkin[/i] game, lurking deep in its DNA, and every effort must be taken to prevent it from expressing itself.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>More stupid fun, this time at the End of the World!  

The seal mechanic provides some interesting twists:

•  An immediate effect upon opening,
•  An ongoing global effect, and
•  An alternate game end and win condition.  

If you&#039;re loaded with gear and prepped for the End of Days then you want to open as many seals as possible and end the world; if you&#039;re less well prepared or close to a Level 10 win you want to prevent the opening of and/or close seals.  This makes for a ridiculous tug-of-war across a thanatropically chimeric landscape of various sci-fi threats, eco-disaster, nuclear armageddon &amp; religious prophecy.

	<numplays>38</numplays>			<comment>It turns out I already own [i]three other[/i] fantasy [i]Munchkin[/i] sets—which makes me either stupid, rich or duped.  I think I&#039;ll go with &quot;hopelessly funtropic&quot; &amp; &quot;shame-impaired&quot; instead.

So why yet another?  Well, the original is in the camping bin and gets begripped by the filthy hands of wild children, the second is &quot;pure sepia&quot; from the era before full-color cards, and the third is specifically frosted for Christmas holiday play.  This one, though, was conceived via the hideous congress of my anal retentive tendencies and my irrational love for the game—I wanted a set that could absorb and utilize all the various small expansions that SJG poots out with maddening regularity.*

The best [i]Munchkin[/i] boosters either add cards that can be absorbed into a deck of any size like a pinch of spice [size=7][1][/size] or provide a separate mini-deck that comes into play under certain circumstances. [size=7][2][/size]

Unfortunately, this is neither.  As a tightly-themed set, this will really only work when shuffled into the base game alone...  Anything larger and it&#039;ll get swallowed up by deck dilution and rendered meaningless.

This is the way to expand [i]Munchkin[/i]—small, affordable &quot;booster packs&quot; that don&#039;t bloat the game decks but live off to the side on their own, entering the game through special circumstances.

MORE PLEASE!!!

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Sorry, but this gets the [i]actual[/i] rating for all [i]Munchkin[/i] games.  &quot;Munchkin&quot; [i]Munchkin[/i] works because the theme and gameplay are organically intertwined in a perfectly appropriate dance of mechanic and experience.  It models the fantasy RPG gone wrong brilliantly.

This reskinning of the original feels less like a blood-thirsty monk with a Six-Demon Bag and more like your recently divorced uncle with low back pain:  it just doesn&#039;t work. </comment>				</item>

Beyond gimmick, beyond branded swag, this thing is not only indispensable (especially when you have two—one for the party and one for the monster(s)) but genius the way it allows you to manipulate the gaming metaspace using the [i]Scroll of Reversal[/i].  That, and the forlorn looks around the table when the Kill-O-Meters read something ridiculous like 81-80 and the antagonists are all tapped out.

This is the only extra [i]Munchkin[/i] bit that I would consider to be a must-have.

The board is essential for visualizing relative position in the game; you can tell, at a glance, who must be picked on and who will be most amenable to being your lickspittle.

And it fits inside a standard Munchkin box!

I don&#039;t really care for the Epic Munchkin track on the reverse (for play to Level 20) as the game is only really fun for about 30 minutes.

The best [i]Munchkin[/i] boosters either add cards that can be absorbed into a deck of any size like a pinch of spice [size=7][1][/size] or provide a separate mini-deck that comes into play under certain circumstances. [size=7][2][/size]

Unfortunately, this is neither.  As a tightly-themed set, this will really only work when shuffled into the base game alone...  Anything larger and it&#039;ll get swallowed up by deck dilution and rendered meaningless.

Art-wise, however, this set is the bees knees.  Katie Cook RAWKS.

You tear it in half—

:surprise:

—and put one end anywhere more than 10-deep in the treasure deck.  When the bookmark turns up, you get the treasure underneath it while the poor sap who&#039;s draw it was gets nothing!

[imageid=1986598 original]
Garfield&#039;s best CCG.  He cut his teeth on [thing=463][i]Magic[/i][/thing], then over-complicated things with [thing=2122][i]Jyhad[/i][/thing]—and got it just right with this one.  We play a Very Good multi-player variant where each Corp has a pet Runner in their employ; all Corps take their turn simultaneously, then all Runners go.  We&#039;ve played games with up to 8 people (4 Corp-Runner teams).  The most fun I&#039;ve ever had with a CCG, hands down.  

SUPERDELUXE ADDED BONUS FEATURE!!!:  

It plays perfectly fine with unmodified starter decks.

[imageid=1986608 original]
UPDATE:  [gameid=39339] ≠  [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer]Neuromancer[/url]

Unforntunately the [thing=124742]reboot[/thing] has lost the soul of the thing, with a [thing=39339]shoe-horned IP[/thing] inspired by Golden Age science fiction (missing entirely any New Wave or Cyberpunk sensibilities) and art &amp; ethos lacking any real balls, grime or dehumanizing awfulness.  I get the impression it&#039;s written &amp; drawn by kids who don&#039;t know from Cyberpunk literature, having only barely tasted the trappings by sucking regurgitated anime from sippy cups.*

Of course the original is dated—[i]because now we live in that world[/i], having ignored the cautionary tales.  We are all of us junkies at Disneyland, putting digital fixes ahead of outrage at unbridled corporate power, more than happy to trade privacy for convenience.  We willingly carry surveillance devices on us at all times, even into bed- and bathrooms, much to our government&#039;s delight.  Our most private lives are now blatant commodities.  I could go on and on...

[COLOR=#B8B8B8][size=7]data mining - death by drones - cryptocurrency bubbles - machete-powered genocides - anthropogenic climate change - blurg - blurgety-blurg[/size][/COLOR]

ANYWAY

The original&#039;s the best—authentic and faithful to the [thing=47011]originating theme[/thing] in both vibe and mechanics.  It really makes me feel like a massive multinational swatting at the flies that dare rise from the muck... or a slum-bound addict with a used cyberdeck, some MIL-SPEC ICEbreakers and a death wish.

[microbadge=10253]

(Untold numbers of plays between 1996 &amp; BGG)

Set includes the fabled porno-POGs:

[q=Who the hell]I fell into the habit of using POGs as counters for collectible card games as the two fads came to prominence—peaking and subsiding—around the same time in the mid-&#039;90s.  They were cheap, plentiful, and many of them were decorated with seemingly random, head-scratching &quot;art&quot;.  This appealed a great deal to me.

I then came into possession of a &quot;Milkcap Maker&quot;, a device that allowed one to affix any image onto stickered slugs... and the infamous &quot;porno-POGs&quot; were born, as well as the &quot;World&#039;s Busiest POG&quot; which contained more genitalia, mouths and hands on one POG than anyone thought possible at the time.

As of the date of writing (July 2012) we still use the POGs as counters and creatures in [thing=463][/thing] and other games where a proxy bit is called for; they reside on the primary game shelf in a cigar box, well worn, well loved and still a part of most games though there are better, prettier options available.  (The porno-POGs, however, remain hidden away in my old [i]Netrunner[/i] collection as a secret shame—the collision of the Milkcap Maker and several years of [i]Club International[/i] magazine a psychic boobytrap to be sprung by my estate holders upon my demise.)[/q]

[size=7]*I fully understand that I am shouting into an eviscerating whirlwind on this one—the reboot is immensely popular, very easily eclipsing the original in market penetration and number of happy players.  For that I am truly glad—the base engine is a terrific game that deserves to be popular and enjoyed—but as a humble student of Cyberpunk literature I find the reskin to be weak sauce.  It&#039;s a sadly attenuated 6th-gen afterimage that vanishes upon blinking.**[/size]

[imageid=1286231 small]
[b]Notes on the Designer&#039;s Edition:[/b]

Literally ridiculous—outsized and excessive in every way possible.

• The box is so large it strains under the stresses of its own mass.

• It should have come with a built-in shunt—this thing box-farts more air than four Olympic swimmers&#039; lungs.  (No, really—I did the math!)

• There are enough boards and counters for 10 (!) individual wargames.

• While the entire kit accounts for storing everything neatly the same cannot be said for the bulk of the box itself.  [i]Where the hell am I supposed to put this thing?[/i]

In the end it is quite a thing to see, breathtaking to experience firsthand—no photograph can contain its raw majesty—and it is simply a wonder, a miracle that this titanic pinnacle of hobby gaming made it from concept to doorstep intact.

(This was my first Kickstarter and I must say I am thoroughly spoiled by SJG&#039;s superb handling of the entire process.  While the end result has exceeded all expectations it was the journey that let me know I&#039;d backed the right pony—their communication was constant, clear and honest.)

Contains:

1 set of [gameid=172650]
2 sets of Ogre Dice ([gameid=153258] + Green/Black) 
[gameid=168541]
[gameid=152870]

UPDATE:  Really, [i]really[/i] hate the two-hex bits.  They add nothing to the actual gameplay other than the distracting itch that one must constantly be reminded that THE ASS-END IS ILLUSORY and while the probability cloud of a given OGRE&#039;s position might [i]appear[/i] to fill two hexes it really only squats in the front one when its waveform collapses upon observation...

That said, they aren&#039;t completely worthless—it&#039;s fun to sit the 3D models near their record sheets for the visual impact.  But I am immeasurably glad I picked up the Classic Counters so I have some OGREs that are appropriate for actual play.

I won&#039;t be counting individual plays, but rather [i]entire sessions[/i]—it&#039;s so quick we never play it fewer than a bunch of times in a sitting!

Also:  The free app is pretty sweet—it runs through the whole script (based on the roles in play), makes atmospheric background noises to cover the inevitable shuffle of cards, and has a configurable countdown timer which then calls for the vote.

So this gets pulled out and my wife chirps, &quot;Who&#039;s on the table?&quot;  (We were all hoping it was Jar Jar.)

Now, let&#039;s be real.  This is only &quot;Operation&quot; if you can accidentally nick an artery or sever a nerve, if there are loved ones crying and hugging one digit away from speed-dialing an army of lawyers.

With R2 on the table this is little more than &quot;Vacuum Cleaner Repair&quot;.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>This game is like a billion times more fun than it has any right to be.  It has the perfect amount of card-counting  (read: tiny), with mildly sweaty risk-taking and steely-eyed one-upmanship.  And it&#039;s fast—[i]superfast[/i].  You don&#039;t tally plays of this thing, you mark [i]sessions[/i].  Upon first exposure we spent hours with this; hilarious, gregarious, table-knocking, good-time hours.  When we finally broke up for the night every couple flew off to buy their own copies.  Yeah, copies with an &quot;s&quot;—these decks are going to get [i]thrashed[/i].  And sleeving them misses the point entirely.

While you [i]could[/i] mock up your own copy or bash one together out of three standard decks of cards (or even repurpose that abandoned [thing=929]Dalmuti[/thing] deck, you know, the one knocking around in the bottom of the drawer with the &#039;90s porno mags and the truss from your operation twelve years ago) why would you when you can play with a set like this

[imageid=2766786 small]
[size=7]Fig. 1 — [i]They say we did not evolve to eat cheese.  They are wrong.[/i][/size]

that appeals to both gentlemen [i]and[/i] ladies, as well as being suitable for children?  Do what you feel, man, but personally I&#039;m overcome with the feeling that I want Mr. Ernest &amp; co. to have my money...

...[i]and my baby.[/i]

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>[i]Weird.[/i]

&quot;Pink Hijinks&quot; is less a euphemism for pantsless monkey shenanigans and more something Keanu Reeves might do in front of a green screen circa 1995.

Evocative of cyberpunk ICEbreaking–in the most superficial of senses—as the win conditions feel like unlocking a gateway or crashing a system.  (Not to be confused with [i]actual[/i] code breaking as there&#039;s already a &#039;mid game for that:  [gameid=30583].)

Random and feather-light—qualities that are just fine in a tiny little filler like this.

Strangely, me likey.

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s craps with a theme—but oh, what a theme!  Makes you lose your voice, though.  &quot;I feel a &#039;nyar&#039; comin&#039; on... [i]NYARRR!!![/i]&quot;

:arrrh:

The unofficial subtitle for this game is [i]Guess Wrong &amp; Fight![/i]  It&#039;s best to avoid everyone as the loser of a sea battle tends to get hammered into an irrevocable last place.  On the surface this would seem to be anti-piratey but in reality it&#039;s probably accurate—skulking around avoiding &quot;fair&quot; fights while preying on the weak.

It is terribly annoying, though, as the winner gets more and more powerful and goes over the horizon into the sunset.

Best played with the understanding that it&#039;s a completely random experience game that doesn&#039;t yield to thought, planning, or strategy.</comment>				</item>

And the best part is that any respectable gamer with enough table-cred should be able to cobble together a workable set from common household items (like [i]Episode II[/i] Slurpee cups and scads of dice).

The Playroom edition is embarrassingly overproduced with lush graphics and silky cards.  If you dig Hearts, prepare to have all your acetylcholine receptors locked up by this, Advanced Hearts.

UPDATE:  Take a sharp stick.  Dip it in poop.  Jab your neighbor in the eye.

[i]This is Power Grid.[/i]

(To keep the profanity to a minimum, I will use the barely appropriate euphemism &quot;fudge&quot;, though the bowdlerized form ends up sounding even dirtier what with the slight connotation of fecal matter being involved.)

[i]Power Grid[/i] is one of the best Euros possible because of the endless opportunities to fudge your friends.  And, unlike the usual passive-aggressive glory-hole fudging that happens in most Euros, Power Grid lets you look &#039;em in the face while you go at it.

You get to fudge them in the auctions...

&quot;I didn&#039;t want that stupid plant—I just wanted to watch Elektros fly out of your head.&quot;

Fudge them in the commodities market...

&quot;I&#039;ll get around to using all this coal eventually.  But you, you&#039;ll be hemorrhaging debt into your underwear.&quot;

And fudge them most thoroughly on the board...

&quot;Yeah, you&#039;re in the gimp suit until Step 2—whenever that happens.&quot;

Is [i]Power Grid[/i] really all about grudge-fudging?  Yes, yes it is.  And violence, too.  It&#039;s all sex and violence, what with the teeth-kicking and arithmetic.

I suppose we could play like little Fonzies* and stay out of each other&#039;s way... but the first person to get out the duct tape and baseball bat will win, and then it&#039;s on to machetes and AKs.  And once the groin-kicking starts, you can&#039;t go back to just holding hands.

Sure, there&#039;s the whole &quot;peloton&quot; thing, which is probably supposed to act as a rubber band for the stragglers, but in reality it&#039;s just a mechanism for lining up boots with startled mouths.

So if you ever want that &quot;just fudged&quot; feeling without taking your pants off, I suggest you sit down with a bunch of people who don&#039;t love you and play [i]Power Grid[/i].  (Board-flipping and fist-fights optional.)

GET SOME!!!

Cheaper connections &amp; double the churn in the power plant markets make for a faster game.

Something we missed on the first time through:  

I thought the rule to [b]remove the smallest plant[/b] during bureaucracy was [i]instead[/i] of the rule to [b]remove the largest plant[/b]... it turns out it&#039;s [i]both[/i].

You remove the smallest [i]and[/i] the largest, so two new plants at the end of every turn!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Preliminary rating based on one (incorrect) play.  I like the general feel of this fantasy world, as well as the breadth of choice on your turn; however—and this was agreed to by all present—the game was fussy and cramped compared to [i]Talisman[/i].  Several players wished out loud that we were playing [i]Talisman[/i] instead, as it seems to move more quickly and can support more players with less downtime.  Will update after playing correctly.</comment>				</item>

UPDATE:  Just came in the mail AND YES YOU NEED TO READ THAT AS A DOUBLE ENTENDRE

These guys are clearly making games to please an audience that consists only of themselves and their personal demons—[i]without compromise[/i].  If you&#039;re not sure it&#039;s for you then it straight-up isn&#039;t—the velvet ropes are there to save the timid from any further discomfort.

But if you see yourself in this, if the howl from the page calls to something darker beyond the horizon of your eyes... well, then follow it home.

UPDATE:  First play told an amazing story even though we botched a bunch of rules.  If you think of this as a grindhouse simulator, a set of RPG skirmish rules, it ends up as a kick-ass party game.  Can&#039;t wait to play again!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Yeah, it&#039;s a ten.  No, I&#039;m not kidding.

[q=&quot;HiveGod&quot;]Have you ever played a game that felt like it was designed just for you? Meaning it&#039;s the game you&#039;ve been waiting your entire life for, the one you would have designed yourself eventually—and that no one else you know likes?

This is an unabashed [gameid=714] rip-off, overlaid with Insane Clown Posse&#039;s, uh, [i]unique[/i] worldview. It&#039;s essentiallly everything you thought was really, really cool when you were 15 mixed in with a bizarre gnostic philosophy where apotheosis is achieved by simultaneous ascension and damnation.

And, holy crap, I love the hell out of it.

PS. Not a fan of the band—I&#039;m not in their target demographic.   But the game—a slice of heaven with a scoop of hell. Brilliant in an outsider art kind of way. I can&#039;t fully explain it; it just hits me [i]perfectly right.[/i][/q]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Man, I liked this.  Nobody else did.  And the solitaire version requires serious hypnosis, or something.

UPDATE:  Miraculously, this made it to the table again, years (!) later...  and everyone agreed that it deserves deeper exploration.  Looks like it&#039;s getting moved into the regular rotation!  Huzzah!

UP-UPDATE:  Damn, this is a great game.  The constant shift in values (with both the lot up for bid being worth different amounts to each player and the power/value of your suns (money) fluctuating as play progresses) makes for a pretty intense game of bluff, brinksmanship, and double-guessing...  It&#039;s maddening to have to think about taking a lot that you have absolutely no interest in purely to keep it out of the hands of someone who will score big off of it; it&#039;s equally sphincter-clenching to find out that you&#039;ve worked yourself into a corner where someone else&#039;s 1 sun is more powerful than your big, fat 13.  Invoking Ra purely to goad someone into overpaying (just a tad) for something you don&#039;t want anyway is sweaty fun.  I could go on and on.  There are depths to this game that aren&#039;t even hinted at in the rulebook.  Far, far more than the sum of it&#039;s parts.  Deliciously subtle.

Three players may be the sweet spot, as our initial game with five seemed slippery and thin in the control department.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>71</numplays>			<comment>[center][size=6][COLOR=#878787]LIFETIME GAME [microbadge=28495]:star:[microbadge=28496] &quot;PLAY FOREVER&quot;[/COLOR][/size][/center]

Hey, it&#039;s &quot;Space Juan&quot;!  (Thanks to Tod for that.)

After one play, this is a slick little game.  We&#039;re all fans of [i]San Juan[/i], and science fiction, so this one&#039;s a natural for my group.  I was lucky enough to know ahead of time that this was multiplayer solitaire with minimal &quot;screwpportunity&quot; and was, like it says in the title, a race game.  Bring your economic engine online, get it humming &amp; working parasitically off of others&#039; actions, rake in the VPs and end the game on your terms.  At least, that&#039;s the idea.  For me it was more like &quot;guess wrong and waste several turns&quot; and fall behind all red-shifted and small in the rearview scanners.

The integration of theme and design is very good—every card contains a nascent story.

STRATEGY NOTE:  Doing nothing but feeding heavy metals to Planet Disco will not get you the win.  No matter how cool it seems at the time.

Rating could rise (or decay!) with future plays.  We&#039;ll see...

UPDATE:  More plays, more of the game reveals itself.  Wonderfully subtle, and requiring a deft touch—at this point I feel like I&#039;m doing brain surgery with Mickey Mouse hands and usually the patient... [i]dies[/i].  Most games that feel like this push you away and keep you from wanting to do the work to figure it out; this one is so captivating, so tip of the tongue, so [i]almost[/i]-that-time I find I can&#039;t wait to play again.  I feel there&#039;s a couple of metric tons of game in there, game that won&#039;t fully come to light until everyone is comfortable with the cards—much like [i]San Juan[/i] (in which, I must admit, I only recently figured out when to pick Prospector—but when I got that it became a whole new game).

And, as Dave says, &quot;Pursuing the military strategy is just [i]fun[/i].&quot;

So there&#039;s always that.

UP-UPDATE:  70 plays later...

[q=&quot;HiveGod&quot;][i]Race for the Galaxy[/i] is a game that only opens up with experience—it begins as multiplayer solitaire; morphs into an actual race where the goal is to build an engine, pull into the lead and then end the game as quickly as possible; and finally becomes a game about knowing, intimately, what everyone else is up to in their tableaux so you can simultaneously draft off of their efforts while minimizing the amount of &quot;help&quot; you provide with your choice of action for the round.

That last bit is often never reached or grokked by the casual player, but it&#039;s truly where the game is—a player who doesn&#039;t pay attention to everyone else and chooses actions based on what they need most right now will always lose to the player who does pay attention and uses everyone else&#039;s play parasitically.

It can be obvious or subtle, and with good (experienced) players it becomes a very cagey game of quintuplethink, but to my mind it&#039;s well worth the work to get there.  There are few games that reward the effort as thoroughly as [i]Race.[/i][/q]

[i]Day 1:  It&#039;s a goddamn circus out here.  Ships from every upstart empire, commonwealth, federation, confederation and solar sway are buzzing around the thing, each declaring sovereign volumes and eager to plant the first flag.  There are also a disconcerting number of derelicts in eccentric orbits.  Initial scans show some of the crews appear to have committed[/i] mass suicide[i]...

Day 3:  After being violently rebuffed by what we thought were docking tubes, we decided to breach with a volley of science torpedoes.  There is now a good-sized science hole in the structure through which we can begin our survey.

Day 7:  We have begun packing up everything that isn&#039;t bolted down or running away.  Not really sure what any of this junk is—at our scale cleaning protocols and warbots are pretty much the same thing.  It all looks expensive, though.

Day 421:  The damn thing shifts and shifts and [/i]shifts[i]—losses stand at just under a thousand souls.  The jumpdrive techs keep using the term &quot;tesseract&quot;.  Also, it turns out the &quot;feeding tubes&quot; dispense pellets that [/i]eat[i].  I could go on but suffice it to say that Hell would be more hospitable—at least [/i]that[i] place was made for people.[/i]

An epic sci-fi smash-n-grab.  I really enjoy the unique flavor of the orb game, so much so it&#039;s the only way I&#039;ll play [i]AA[/i] from now on.  After all, it&#039;s the whole point of this arc!  If I have the urge to go small-deck/simple I&#039;ll just play the base game or base + [i]Gathering Storm[/i].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>With the addition of the prestige axis the game executes a quantum upshift into the heady and intricate.  The experience is best with experienced players, so you&#039;re either playing this with the people you&#039;ve always played with or you&#039;re gradually indoctrinating newbs...  Don&#039;t be in a hurry.  So much of this is about knowing the massive deck, the strengths and weaknesses of the various strategies, the probability of ending up with a certain card.  (Not to mention being able to intuit which actions will be played to maximize your parasitic benefit while minimizing how much you help your foes.)  Jumping straight into the deep end is bewildering and much of what makes the game great will be lost on the drowning man.

The final result is a triumph in every possible way—gorgeous, evocative, vexing and just plain [i]fun[/i].  

To paraphrase my friend Jas:  [i]Now it feels like a complete game, on par with the heavier Euros.[/i]

And I could play it forever.

PS.  Keldon&#039;s brilliant AI implementation is my go-to digital time-waster—two AI opponents, all expansions, takeovers on.  Though it lacks the delicious human element of outguessing, the rest of the experience is deep enough that it doesn&#039;t matter.  And it&#039;s a great way to learn the deck and noodle with crazy strategies. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>52</numplays>			<comment>More of the good stuff.  The best kind of expansion in that it doesn&#039;t so much alter the game as make it more of what it already is, makes it better by amplifying the best parts of the original.

Adding VP objectives to &quot;fight&quot; over (most planets, etc.) is probably the closest we&#039;ll get to direct confrontation in this system*... but then, it&#039;s an optimization race, not a brawl.

If you didn&#039;t like the game before, this won&#039;t do anything to change your mind—but if you do like it, this is a must.

[microbadge=6643]

UPDATE:  Sure, the &quot;robot&quot; is just a couple dice and a flowchart—but I hate him [i]so much.[/i]  Doesn&#039;t he understand that I can chuck his dice into the ocean and burn his smarmy card?  DON&#039;T THINK I WON&#039;T

UP-UPDATE:  I consider the base game the &quot;training wheels&quot; version and this the default.  I&#039;ve started new players here with good results as the additional overhead does not make the game opaque to the uninitiated.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Is [i]Rage[/i] better than Oh Hell/Blackout?  I dunno...  The action cards and two extra suits add an element of chaos and high-screwery to the proceedings, which, with the right crowd, could enhance the whole groaning/cackling fun.  On the other hand they actively reduce the amount of skill that can be brought to bear.  So... more fun, but with less skill.  Perhaps this is the &quot;party game&quot; version of Oh Hell?

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>After a single play (sans cards) of [i]Railroad Tycoon[/i], I was hooked.  A great medium-weight train game that looks fantastic and plays fast with low rules-overhead.

After 6 plays of [i]Railways[/i] (5x 2-player (no cards), 1x 4-player (with cards), all on the Mexico map):

The cards (Barons &amp; Operations) add flavor and chaos into the mix.  With the cards you have a highly thematic family (or casual) game that&#039;s still meaty at the core; without the cards the game becomes a tighter, more vicious mathematical pissing contest, akin to [i]There Will Be Blood[/i] the boardgame, with plenty of forehead-vein-popping &quot;I drink [i]your[/i] milkshake&quot; moments.

I have no experience with the parent game ([gameid=4098]) beyond looking at pictures on the Internet and recoiling at how ugly it is—of course, this means it&#039;s a Very Serious Game, since everyone knows the ugliest games are the most rigorous and stern.  I like my math to be fun, so, yeah, it was the pretty bits that finally pulled me in... but the gameplay is solid.

[floatleft][imageid=1453104 small][/floatleft]
Painting the &quot;Empty City&quot; markers really kicks the visual presentation over the top and makes the game feel like playing with a tiny model train set.  Much like the satisfying diorama you&#039;re left with at the end of [thing=31260][/thing]*, the board is beautiful after a frenzied game of financial ruination and axe handle hobo-beatings.

On the one hand, I&#039;m a big fan of Faidutti&#039;s work, it plays up to eight (!), and no other game I know allows you to nearly drown, catch on fire and then achieve crush depth while counting down a nuclear missile launch.  On the other hand it&#039;s really just a filler that takes about an hour-and-a-half too long for what it is.  If it played through in 30 minutes I&#039;d probably give it a nine, easy.  I suppose future plays will tell.  Does it get shorter with familiarity?  Will we be willing to jump in again, and enough, to find out?  Will anyone remember that fires deplete the oxygen track?</comment>				</item>

Also, [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/12267511#12267511]this[/url].

UPDATE:  Definitely a kinder, gentler [i]Talisman[/i].  The knockouts are softer, allowing you to keep most of your crap even when your character is corrupted and bursts with tentacles and hate and scurries off into one of the Threat decks to become an encounter.*  Also, while it&#039;s still possible to get royally hosed by CARDS &amp; DICE and wind up wandering from world to world like some kind of piteous cybernetic hobo, this is less likely if you &quot;stick to your color&quot; and grind on worlds that bend to your strengths.  Instead of the usual mid-game malaise there is a whirlwind, a heady upward spiral of mad leveling where Middle Tier encounters bring multiple foes into your dread presence to ablate hideously in the effulgence of your gaining three levels at once.  This makes for a shorter game (not that brevity is expected or even desired in Epic Adventure, but still) while increasing the tension of the race... and that just leads to more ill-considered risk-taking and derring-do (read:  [i]hilarity[/i]).

UP-UPDATE:  8 --&gt; 9  The Mission mechanism is a neat way to drive character motivation in interesting directions—you have a clear goal from the get-go—as well as making the path to gaining a relic (this game&#039;s talisman) obvious and achievable.  Also, the more we play the more impressed I am with the almost perfect synthesis of game and milieu; this is the full flavor of the 40k mythos laid on thick and tasty.  The game unfolds beautifully from the interplay of the random decks and static board.

Lots of cool stuff:  new characters, PvP, and, of course, the eponymous nemeses.

As for 5-6p games... new stuff and play modes notwithstanding, I just don&#039;t see it working in a reasonable time frame.  Like [i]Talisman[/i] this is a storytelling game, and sitting idly by while spectating on the herky-jerky chapters of [i]four or five other stories[/i] makes for oppressive downtime.  In my experience 4p is the absolute maximum, with 3p being the sweet spot.  Naturally, YMMV.

[b]Thoughts after first play:[/b]

Rex, AKA &quot;Wrecks&quot;

Really, very nifty.  The wildly asymmetrical player powers make for interesting combinations during alliances, the whole thing being a variable machine the players can construct as they go—a machine that spends most of the time shuddering sideways while gloriously out of whack; much of the experience is spent desperately trying to get everything back in balance, only to have it veer madly into crazyland again.  But that&#039;s what makes it memorable—it&#039;s rife with delicious quintuplethink and opportunities for clever play.

The shoehorned [i]Twilight Imperium[/i] IP, which is, according to FFG&#039;s marketing, &quot;rich, vibrant, and evocatively adjectival&quot;, is okay, I guess, though it does end up making it feel more like David Lynch&#039;s 1984 adaptation of [i]Dune[/i]—a familiar thing bent in weird ways.  It&#039;s definitely in the &quot;milk the cat&quot; category.

[b]EDITIONS OWNED:[/b]

[b]The 1970s one with the caltrops[/b] 
:star::star::halfstar::nostar::nostar:
My very favorite xmas present when I was 10 or so; played many times all by myself.  Lovingly maintained in a state of arrested decay.  Rating is for the standard Global Domination game, though it can shoot to [i]superawesome[/i] with the right people.  And beer.

[b]2003 Edition[/b]
:star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
Self-purchased for the mission cards.  Makes the base game waaay more playable.

[b][gameid=1829][/b]
:star::star::star::halfstar::nostar:
Self-purchased for science fiction theme.  Good stuff—almost an entirely different game.

[b][gameid=8107][/b]
:star::star::star::halfstar::nostar:
Self-purchased because I&#039;m a fanboy.  Pretty cool for what it is.

[b][gameid=15045][/b] 
:star::star::star::halfstar::nostar:
Purchased for the kids.  (Yeah, right.)  Pretty decent 2-player game.

[b][gameid=22551][/b] 
:star::star::star::halfstar::nostar:
Purchased for me.  (The biggest kid in the house.)  Great for 3-players.

[b][gameid=37198][/b]
:star::star::star::star::nostar:
Fantastic additions to the base engine—cities, capitals, objectives, a new card-exchange regime (turn in 2-10 stars for 2-30 troops) and a VP-based victory condition make this a completely different game. 

UPDATE:  I really, really like the idea of [i]Risk[/i]—the stupid-simple conflict game of smack-talk and dice-chucking—far more than actually playing it.  It would be difficult to convince me to play the default Global Domination version of this, no matter how tempting the snacks, beer and company.  I&#039;m much better disposed toward the improved versions—missions, [i]2210[/i], [i]LotR[/i], or one of the Star Wars ones.  Even better, the 2008 Revised Edition.

That said, I do play an awful lot of Global Domination [i]Risk[/i] in digital formats—you can tap out an entire game in less than 20 minutes.*  Stupid fun.

And then there&#039;s always this:

[i]And this is without opening any packets.[/i]  With sticker and Sharpie we have left our mark on this embattled world—the warlords of Thunderia, New Sparta and Sasquatchistan showing themselves to be more than willing to pop nukes in pristine old-growth forests and water the virgin plains with the blood of orphans in order to... to... uh, I used to know the reasons why, but now all I know is [i]hate.[/i]

Don&#039;t fool yourself—if you&#039;re not defacing the hell out of this game you&#039;re not even getting 1% of the experience it has to offer.  It&#039;s like the difference between masturbating to an underwear catalog vs. a threesome with real people.

This is, only three games in, among the best gaming experiences I&#039;ve ever had.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s [i]Risk[/i], and if you&#039;re a hater, then get ready to turn your nose up and move along—there&#039;s nothing for you here.

If you don&#039;t mind the [i]Risk[/i] base engine, then this one has a couple of neat little quirks for you.  First and foremost, the triple use of cards leads to some acutely agonizing decisions.  They can be turned in as sets to gain reinforcements, OR used to build a ship, OR played for their special effect text.  Secondly, the non-compatability of the two armies within each faction makes for more interesting play.  The Republic and the Separatists each have two armies, and no matter how many players there are, all four armies will be in play.  The two armies within each faction cooperate for the end-goal, but they cannot share territory or cards—and each army gets its own turn.  

The Order 66 shenannigans add a nerve-wracking thematic clock to the game; watching systems flip to the dark side is a nail-biter for the Republic player... culminating in a desperate, last-gasp mad-dash assault on Palpatine.  The all-or-nothing feel of the endgame is simply delicious.  

There&#039;s not as much going on here as there is in [i]2210[/i] or [i]LotR[/i], but my 11-year-old son and I had a great time.  Overall a good rootbeer &amp; pretzels game, provided you like the modern Star Wars and don&#039;t mind [i]Risk[/i].  Lucky for me, I find I&#039;m hovering at a sweet-spot of equanimity in respect to both.</comment>				</item>

Aspiring interstellar overlords commit handpicked citizens to a mind-warping battle school where they are... [i]changed[/i].  These agents are then dispatched on desperate missions across the cosmos—leading a surgical strike force of war-painted starships, or skin crawling with invisible tattoos that reconfigure into malware under certain wavelengths of light, or their skulls the vessels for a single dangerous idea.

Tomorrow, tomorrow belongs to the Ascendant—and there is no better way to leap for the brass ring than with a boot in your grasping rival&#039;s face.

[microbadge=26108]

[i]An unalloyed slam-dunk.[/i]  As a rabid [i]Race[/i] fan I am obviously predisposed to love this, but honestly, [i]Roll[/i] has far exceeded even my naturally high expectations.  Added to everything that&#039;s already fantastic about the Mother Game we have a gorgeous feast for the senses—the spray of color, the sound of the dice in the cups, the shaking and slamming, the digging around in that black bag for deliciously textured tiles.

It&#039;s a sci-fi jacuzzi with built-in mind-massage attachment.*

UPDATE:  11 games in and the response from newbs is overwhelming—all of them have found this far more accessible than [i]Race[/i] proper.  I believe it has to do with the fact that any given [i]Race[/i] game is completely hidden inside an opaque deck of cards, meaning that the game doesn&#039;t open up until you&#039;re familiar with the contents of that deck, and this requires either a bunch of boring study or many—[i]so many[/i]—crushing defeats.  With [i]Roll[/i], on the other hand, the dice give you a pretty big hint as to what&#039;s possible on your turn and so tend to drive play in more obvious directions right out of the gate.

Besides, fiddling around with the dice to &quot;program&quot; your turn feels like you&#039;re [i]actually doing something[/i] rather than just looking at a bunch of cards and having no real idea of what to do next.

[b]A Very Important Note on Space Marine Recruitment:[/b]  As the recruitment protocols are a preëxisting component of the drinking water on most civilized worlds, the consumption of them constitutes retroactive consent.

Low speed, high drag.  This game is a lot better on the planet where they never invented [gameid=215].  I understand that Rook glows warmly with nostalgia for some folks; unfortunately I came to this way too late in the game for it to matter.

Be warned, though—downtime is a SERIOUS problem—I would NEVER want to play this with more than three.

My son and I are enjoying the hell out of this one—a great way to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon.  Rootbeer &amp; pretzels, anyone?

NOTE:  Rating is for the [i]Runebound[/i] system as a whole—the base game, with nothing but the &quot;Rise of the Dragonlords&quot; adventure, pulls a solid 8.  It soars to a 10 when considered with the plethora of expansions, especially the Adventure Variants (each with a different overarching plot).

A fun adventure game system from the &quot;pull a card, read the encounter, roll some dice&quot; family.  Can be boring with dull people—it requires a certain amount of storytelling ability to make it interesting.  Why do you get a plus to Diplomacy after you kill the Hill Troll?  Because you made a backpack out of his scrotum, that&#039;s why.  Plays best with 2 or, maaaybe, 3.

UPDATE:  We managed nine plays out of the 1st Edition, and that was with no expansions.  As this is a &quot;Saturday afternoon&quot; game (taking several hours) that means we got somewhere around two months&#039; worth of Saturdays out of it.  Two months of solid play off a single scenario.  With all the scenarios FFG has been pumping out since 2nd Edition debuted, the replay value of this one blows through the roof, soars into orbit and then takes a hard left into a magical wormhole... who can say where it will end.  Huge amount of bang-for-buck on this one.

UP-UPDATE:  Tweaks that make for more gaming goodness, IMO:

1)  Use the &quot;shorter game&quot; rules (essentially making it cheaper to level up).

2)  Separate the massive market deck into three piles:  the Tavern (allies), the Smithy (weapons &amp; armor), and the Bazaar (a catch-all for familiars, magic items &amp; artifacts).  This allows players to really target the holes in their kit/entourage without endless turns of market-stepping loads of junk they don&#039;t need.

3)  Ignore PvP.  (This is a personal &quot;play-style&quot; choice as there&#039;s nothing wrong with it; we just found it slowed things down.)

While these tweaks speed up the game, I&#039;m not saying the game needs speeding up.  For a lazy Saturday afternoon (especially a bad weather one) this game expands to fill the time nicely.  We&#039;ve found that the above tweaks will take an afternoon game and turn it into a evening game.  And that just means we get to play more!

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>[b]tl;dr[/b] — A solid storytelling/adventure game that&#039;s best with two players; the token-casting combat system is better than dice.

[COLOR=#CC0000][i]There&#039;s something deeply satisfying about taking a whip and an axe to a necromancer.[/i][/COLOR]

Say, friend—are you looking for a game with

- expendable sidekicks
- wizard-scalping

[b]After 10 plays:[/b]  [COLOR=#979797](5x 2p, 3x 3p, 2x 4p)[/COLOR]

[i]Comparison with 2nd Edition.[/i]
I am a HUGE [i]Runebound[/i] fan—having burned through 1st Edition and collected a complete set of 2nd—and I really like what 3rd is up to.  It&#039;s an entirely different game, and doesn&#039;t supersede or obsolete 2nd in any way.  I will continue to play both, for different reasons:  2nd to bask in a fully-realized fantasy adventure world, 3rd to explore the new thing.  Comparisons between the two at this point are useless—remember how thin and spare 2nd was when it first came out?  3rd is just a new beginning...

[i]Emergent narrative.[/i]
When it comes to games in general I&#039;m most interested in the stories they tell; when it comes to adventure games it&#039;s [i]all[/i] I care about.  I don&#039;t give a fig for the systems, mechanics, or underlying math—[i]I just want a good story.[/i]  My only questions are &quot;Was it fun?&quot; and &quot;Was it memorable?&quot;  3rd nails both, and so far [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/plays/thing/181530?userid=9685]the stories have been fantastic[/url].

[i]Build the character you want.[/i]
Everyone I&#039;ve played this with really enjoys the fact that you can build pretty much any kind of character you want to play.  Though each character starts on a path you are not forced down it—you can change it up based on how skills and gear come out.  Lord Hawthorne can become a powerful mage even as Master Thorn deviates into a combat monster, leaping from wall to wall lopping off heads...  It&#039;s cool to hunt for killer combos of abilities/skills/gear—there&#039;s a lot of very powerful synergy hidden in the game. 

[i]Play time.[/i]
Count on at least one hour per player; you can knock 30 minutes off the total if everyone&#039;s experienced.  This means 2p in 90 minutes (!) but you&#039;re still looking down the barrel of 3½ hours for 4p.

[i]Player count.[/i]
This is, first and foremost, a story game—and as such it suffers at max player count where there&#039;s just too much story to pay attention to.  With 2p you have your story and your opponent&#039;s story (as well as being engaged in every round of combat, either doing it or running the monster); delightful.  With 3p you have two other stories to pay attention to; a stretch, but not unreasonable.  With 4p you have [i]three other[/i] stories and I find it&#039;s just too much story flying around as all the action becomes a mishmash of narrative elements to no good effect.  The sweet spot is definitely 2-3p.

[i]Final analysis.[/i]
While I could go into more detail about what I&#039;ve come to love about this, I won&#039;t, for the simple reason that it&#039;s a game of exploration and adventure—and that means it&#039;s best experienced in person over time rather than laid out for you here.  You&#039;re going to have to figure out for yourself how to become a hero in this world—how best to prepare for that final fight as the clock ticks down; how to interleave movement toward your next goal with mundane pick-up-and-deliver jobs and exploration quests; how best to utilize and sequence your interactions with the three kinds of encounter decks... and so on.  You could sit down, read all the cards, and min-max your way into an empty, soulless win bereft of surprise or novelty—or you could [i]just play[/i], explore the world organically and become that hero through trial and error across many raucous sessions with friends.  The resulting stories are the real treasure here.

SIDE NOTE:  [i]Runebound[/i] is one of the few &quot;system&quot; games that I don&#039;t feel bad buying every last expansion for.  Most system games hit a point where more stops being better ([i]Carcassonne[/i], anyone?).  With [i]Runebound[/i], the excellent minds at Fantasy Flight have found a way to make &quot;more&quot; mean &quot;nuance&quot;.  Kudos &amp; pass the dice!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Very different feel from the base game.  It&#039;s an often awful choice whether to travel by day or night... do you bake in the desert sun, stumbling along with withered lips and wild eyes or do you chance getting ambushed in the pale light of the desert moon?  Also, the travels and travails of the legendary quests are a great change of pace from the &quot;kill reds until you get the game-winning one&quot; strategy of The Rise of the Dragon Lords.  You only have to kill a single red (any one will do)  to set yourself up for the endgame, but even that doesn&#039;t seal the win—you still need to complete that fourth quest.  All in all, great fun.

Recommended.

PS.  A nifty detail:  the more legendary quests you complete, the more narrow your possible story becomes; some legendary allies will leave you if you kill certain encounters, for example.  Sometimes you have to flee a monster in order not to upset the very entourage that makes you a legend...  The result is that power comes at a price—the more you can do, the more judicious you have to be.  So instead of just juggernauting across the landscape and leaving a trail of dead, you actually have to pick your fights based on the legend you are building.  This helps keep the stories thematic and prevents (to some extent) run away leaders.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>A welcome respite from endless farming in the Brown Zone.

&quot;Sack up &#039;n take yer beatin&#039; like a man.&quot;

UPDATE:  Rating of 8 based on box contents &amp; rules.  Actual play pending... but highly anticipated.

UP-UPDATE:  First play had the Elves exterminating the Humans to the last child and then erasing them from the Chronicles of All Times &amp; Peoples.  THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE GAME.  Makes [i]Twilight Imperium[/i] look like a steam-powered jitney next to a Lamborghini... with a supermodel who&#039;s been eating cupcakes [i]for the last six weeks[/i] draped most buxomly over the hood.*  

[i]Agricola[/i], in its dreams, [i]wishes[/i] it was this nasty.

PS. The heroes are just fine as is.  They act as:

[i]Spies![/i] 
(they allow you to look at Dragon Runes so you know where the real ones are)

[i]Saboteurs![/i] 
(they can pop off spells in the midst of the enemy just before you attack)

[i]Assassins![/i]
(they kill &amp; loot other heroes)

[i]Agents For The Win![/i]
(they can get you more Dragon Runes).

They don&#039;t need to lead armies if you&#039;re using them to best advantage doing all of the above.  Besides, hero ≠ general... do you really want some homeless wizard who smells like cat pee leading an army it took you two years to amass?

Most were non-gamers, several were merely casual.  Gramma marveled at how much fun could be had with just a deck of cards, and how much [gameid=1269] sucked in comparison.

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Take [i]Puerto Rico[/i] and boil off all the fussy crap.  What&#039;s left in the bottom of the cauldron is a gooey tar of condensed fun.  Roll the tar out and cut it into rectangles and you have [i]San Juan[/i].

This one wins out over its older brother in three very important areas—it&#039;s accessible, portable and short.  In the time it would take you to play a single game of [i]Puerto Rico[/i] (not counting rules explanation (shudder)) you could play three games of this [i]including[/i] an overview of the rules.  [i]San Juan[/i] has the potential to see far more table time than [i]PR[/i].  That make it clearly superior in my book.  Recommended.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I get the feeling this is better suited as a tabletop minis game.  As an RPG...

[q]Great idea, awful execution.  The text routinely references rules that are nowhere to be found, and there&#039;s no index so you&#039;re often SOL figuring things out.

It wasn&#039;t until a thorough reading of the [rpgitem=47891][/rpgitem] book and cross-referencing that with the [rpgitem=44199][/rpgitem] book that I pieced together how combat and wounding work.

Lastly, having dice pools made up of different dice is gamey and takes away from fast, furious storytelling.

Ultimately disappointing—I love the format and where the creators are coming from, it just doesn&#039;t work for my group.[/q]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Drop-dead gorgeous production values slathered over a so-so apparatus.  After two plays I&#039;m into it and looking forward to more, but will henceforth heed the common warning that 4p is just too much.  Downtime was brutal and who knows, maybe it picks up with familiarity but I&#039;m not interested in finding out.

It feels like an 8 but I&#039;m gonna make [i]Seasons[/i] work for it.

Also:  Big chunky dice FTW!

UPDATE:  So, four plays in &amp; I&#039;m pretty sure this is just a 2p experience.  Even with only 3p the downtime during two consecutive super-turns (with card play and effects chaining on and on and on...) is an enthusiasm killer.  Especially when my stupid turn is &quot;I gain two energy.  Next!&quot; followed by two more super-turns.  [i]Gaaah.[/i]

UP-UPDATE:  Six games in, it&#039;s an 8.  Play time&#039;s picking up as we become more familiar with the cards and we haven&#039;t even cracked the &quot;advanced&quot; set of 20.  Just plain friendly and appealing.  What can I say?  It&#039;s... [i]nice[/i]... like a warm, French bubble bath.  I can soak.

UP-UP-UPDATE:  [i]I slipped on the Temporal Boots, thinking I was all kinds of clever—only to find myself sprinting backwards, screaming, into the Port-A-Potty to suck yesterday&#039;s dump up through the hole.[/i]

A DESPERATE RACE AGAINST GENOCIDE

Four flavors of a mad religious cult—persecuted in the Mother Country—make landfall on an eerily uninhabited island* and immediately get cracking on converting the primordial landscape into armed camps and the machinery of war.  An uneasy détente ensues as no one has the upper hand... but soon, soon one faction will reach the tipping point and become powerful enough to strike against the heretics [i]and wipe them out[/i].

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>FINALLY—a short, fun, thematically interesting game for large groups.  Whenever we hit 6, 7 or 8, no one wants to break up into two games for fear of being stuck at the &quot;unfun&quot; table.  This usually means we get stuck playing the suck.  What, exactly?  I dunno,  but whatever it was, it wasn&#039;t memorable.

Many have been calling this a better [gameid=3955], and indeed, it is.

Recommended.

UPDATE:  Whoever let Hello Kitty do the translation on this one should be fired.  Or is that &quot;up-flamed into transemployment&quot;?

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>A nifty little tactics puzzle.  Played quickly with the full compliment of five.  Everyone agreed that I won because I was allowed to go about my business unmolested.

[b][COLOR=#FF0000]NOTE:  THIS GAME REQUIRES MOLESTATION[/color][/b]

Looking forward to playing it again.  I doubt my rating will rise, though it could fall once the shine comes off...

UPDATE:  This is a great game.  Very simple rules means that it&#039;s worked as (gasp!) a [i]gateway[/i] game for absolute n00bz.  Also, the tactical and strategic depths are both deceptively shallow—meaning that the obvious simplicity of the &quot;pick up/put down/score&quot; gameplay hides deeper decisions...  When to bunch up into a hard knot and when to spread thin?  When to decline?  Who do you pick on, and how?  The timing of these issues is what decides the winner.

Also, there is no shortage of absolute dick-moves in this game—I recommend mouthguards and running shoes, or someone&#039;s gonna lose teeth.

UP-UPDATE:  11 plays in (+1.4 bajillion plays on the iPad app) show this thing has functionally infinite replayability.  [i]Love it![/i]

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I liked the graduated questions designed to trip up the impatient know-it-alls and favor the patient, but the die roll to see how far you advance on the board is asinine.  Our team won, but the other team that had at least as many correct answers as we did never made it further than a quarter around the board due to shitty rolls and constantly landing on the &quot;go back 3 spaces&quot; space.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>After 3 plays:

A lighter [i]take that[/i] card game with THE AWESOMEST THEME POSSIBLE:  disparate genre tropes wedded as conjoined twins to do battle with enemy Frankendecks.  The presentation and form promise hilarious, rapid back-and-forth; this is unrealized in actual play as everything bogs down with the reading Reading READING of too much text on most every card, leading to more rereading and rules-interaction head scratching.

Perhaps this will pick up with familiarity?

	<numplays>71</numplays>			<comment>&quot;Luke, you’ve switched off your targeting computer. What’s wrong?&quot;

Picked this up based on raves from [b]Geeks I Trust™[/b] and busted it out first thing Saturday morning...  played so many games with my youngest son I lost count.  Our ruckus woke my lazy teen who then joined in for, yes, so many games I lost count.

[i]Sorry! Sliders[/i] has all the elements of the best dexterity games:

- It&#039;s rules light

- Instantly grokkable

- Uses skills or abilities everyone already posseses

- Observers think they have a shot at doing better than the person they just watched go.

I&#039;m tempted to slap a 10 on this, and I expect it to end up there after a debut at a family function.  We&#039;ll see what my regular game group thinks about this—they&#039;re old and crotchety, after all, with none of the childish glee that comes from flick-slamming another player&#039;s pawn into the netherrealm... okay, scratch that.

UPDATE:  Okay, busted this out with my regular group of emotionally-stunted man-children who took one look at the box and made faces and directly questioned my manhood, mental state and geek cred... fast forward through More Games Than I Can Count™ and they were grappling with a new addiction, stunned and shamed that they just... couldn&#039;t... walk away.

Money Quote:  &quot;We should play this for money—five bucks a game.&quot;  

Then, doing the This-Is-Not-Happening body-rock:  &quot;Just five more dollars... five more dollars...&quot;

UP-UPDATE:  It&#039;s a ten!  I&#039;ll always be willing to play this, and really, who wouldn&#039;t at five minutes a game?  The kicker for me was an extended session with my usual game group where we had five of us and hot-swapped the winner&#039;s seat.  It&#039;s so good, and short, that the odd man out never got bored.  In fact, the incentive to win became more than mere crowing-rights—it meant you could get a snack... and use the bathroom.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>So much more than a mere game—this is an amazing artifact, a tool, in the exercise of teamwork, planning, and unforeseen consequences.  Seriously—it could be used for real-life team training.

But before you wave off because you&#039;re worried you&#039;ll be forced to play this with your boss at a corporate retreat, know that it&#039;s tense, trying (in the good way) and most of all fun.  The theme is hard-SF enough to feel serious, with just a dusting of levity that never becomes cartoony (something that turns me off of [i]Galaxy Trucker[/i]).

I was worried the audio track would be goofy and kitschy, but instead I found it to be brilliantly immersive.</comment>				</item>

[i]Space Hulk[/i] is the best game that Games Workshop ever made, and this is the best edition of that game.  Worth every penny.

For the Ameritrash-curious, this is as good as it gets—[i]Space Hulk[/i] shows just how transcendent games can be.  It&#039;s the perfect example of why I bother to play games in the first place.

Easiest 10 I&#039;ve ever given.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>An absolutely terrific distillation of the [i]Space Hulk[/i] experience as a card game.  A real nail-biter, tense and filled with hard choices and awful [i]almost[/i] moments.  (As any good co-op should be.)

There is a real sense of increasing claustrophobia as Space Marines are slain and the formation collapses in on itself; the way swarms of Genestealers shift and wheel to flank the cumbersome Terminators induces a delicious sense of being overwhelmed.

It is a game of grand cinematic moments—[i]after luring a great mass of the swarm into the proximity of an aeons-corroded Promethium tankage, Brother Noctis sacrificed himself to obliterate the foul xenos in a cleansing firestorm[/i]—as well as careful strategizing with teammates to interleave actions into a tightly choreographed dance of death.  When you pull it off, it&#039;s exhilarating.  (Most of the time you won&#039;t.)

[i]Love it.[/i]

UPDATE:  I really don&#039;t want to like this game...  but it&#039;s not letting me not like it.

UP-UPDATE:  At this point [i]The Spoils[/i] is a game that&#039;s good enough.  The theme is an easy 10.  The art is another effortless 10.  But the play... [shrug]  As I said, good enough, a solid 7, nothing wrong here, no tumors under the petticoats, but nothing that hauls me back for more, either.  I&#039;ll play if asked, no problem—and if I never offer to play it&#039;s only because it&#039;s just slipped my mind.</comment>				</item>

UPDATE:  [i]Munchkin[/i], as a knobbed-up commentary on fantasy RPGs, really only works when it&#039;s holding up its funhouse mirror to the fantasy genre.  I&#039;ve never played a science fiction RPG the way I played [i]Dungeons &amp; Dragons[/i] in 8th grade... so this doesn&#039;t work for me at all.

I would much rather just play fantasy [i]Munchkin[/i].</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Good God but the box is some kind of joke—it actually tore as I opened it, and this was going in forewarned of its flimsiness!  I suppose the designers, as [gameid=463] fiends, consider deck packaging to be the equivalent of sausage casings, only there to keep the meaty bits in one place until wolfed down.  I recommend immediate replacement with, say, a translucent deck box.

First couple plays:  Just like the last breath torn from your lungs during a decompression event, this is short and far sweeter than you&#039;d think.  I am especially impressed with what must have been a great deal of editing on the part of the designers in order to arrive at such simplicity when it would have been so easy—and surely seductive—to just keep piling on more and more...

And it turns out I&#039;m a sucker for the badass sci-fi art—any one of those cards would look just plain [i]awesome[/i] airbrushed onto a panel van.

PS.  The Authority Cards (used to track &quot;hit points&quot; for game end) work just fine—they&#039;re not nearly as fiddly or inconvenient as others might have you believe.  I love the fact that they allow for the entire game to fit in a standard hobby deck box with no need for extra bits like glass beads, dice, or even paper &amp; pencil.

I dig the self-contained portability of the thing—in the end it&#039;s just a deck of cards.  And that&#039;s perfect.

I&#039;m not really a [i]Star Wars[/i] fan—it&#039;s just that 89% of my childhood consisted of nothing but [i]Star Wars[/i], [i]The Empire Strikes Back[/i] and [i]Return of the Jedi[/i].  I was 10 when my Mom took me and a friend to see some weird space movie on opening day...  If you were near that age and walked into it blind—[i]with a completely naked psyche[/i]—you get it.  It was like being pulled hot off the anvil and thrust into a screaming slave&#039;s belly...  Tempered in death and rebirth; shocking and permanently formative.  A fulcrum point for generational shift.

As a kid I built X-wing and TIE fighter model kits until my fingers bled and I hallucinated glue-fume Jawas; I would have strangled the children &amp; little people inside the rough brown cloaks with my inflatable lightsaber for a game like this.  (Still would.)  So to say that the perfectly detailed, tiny model ships resonate would be a massive understatement.

Again, I am not a fan; I find anything other than the original three movies—the &quot;Expanded Universe&quot;, crappy novelizations, comics, Prequels, video games, etc., etc., ad nauseam—to be baby laxative.

But [i]X-Wing[/i] is the pure, uncut stuff, a high as dangerous as time travel and I&#039;m 10 again.

I&#039;ve always loved the Y-wing:  armored and plodding, the thing is a pig that packs a wallop.  Feels just right on the table, especially loaded with a double brace of proton torpedoes.  There&#039;s nothing quite like locking a target, blasting &#039;em with the ion cannon to stop &#039;em dead and then cooking &#039;em off with a volley of torpedoes... unless it&#039;s doing it again!</comment>				</item>

Pretty fun, but it would benefit greatly from a little gloss, like, say, plastic minis with li&#039;l plastic gadets/weapons and an actual cardboard game board with terrain tiles.  Better production values could have pushed this to an 8...  as is, it feels like you&#039;re playing a prototype rather than the finished game.

UPDATE:  I get it.  Plastic would have made this cost like eight million dollars.  But still.</comment>				</item>

An ugly little game where the land sloughs off into an ocean boiling with hungry things.  You try to drive your people to safety, everyone else drives the hungry things to their appointed dinners.

Who will make it off the island alive?  The hairdresser or the Nobel Laureate?

My money&#039;s on NO ONE.

UPDATE:  The art &amp; design in the new 30th Anniversary Edition are flat-out brilliant.  Also, having uniform plastic meeples is actually better than the misshapen, tippy wooden ones from the previous edition.

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>[i]Talismonopoly![/i]

An innocuous, light, roll-n-move family game.  It carries just enough mutant gentic code from [i]Monopoly[/i] &amp; [i]Talisman[/i] to be familiar and accessible to non-gamers and kids, but without any of the associated lethal alleles.  Everyone gets to play &#039;til the end, and there are several balancing mechanisms to keep runaway leaders in check.  Yes, it&#039;s powered by dice, but with two pawns per player and most rolls only letting you move one of them at a time there are choices to make.  This is very much a family game, a &quot;kick back and socialize&quot; game, a &quot;roll the dice and talk like a pirate whilst not caring too terrible much about what happens &#039;cuz we&#039;re all having too good a time just being together&quot; game.  Four-dimensional [i]Tigris &amp; Euphrates[/i] it is not; it gets a 7 because we all had a good time, and really, what more can you ask from such things?  Recommended for families.</comment>				</item>

Yeah, now we can play the game as nature intended—as [i]True Men.[/i]

While I was initially worried at how it would fit in, the Time Card is actually pretty nifty (day/night sides that flip whenever an Event is drawn; creatures get -1 in combat during the day and +1 at night).

But the star of the show is the Werewolf, especially when combined with the Reaper—now you have [i]two[/i] forces of nature stalking the board for victims.  It&#039;s especially good when using one or more corner boards... if everyone clusters up in the City, for example, you can expect the Werewolf &amp; Reaper to converge there, creating a hideous oubliette where a simple shopping trip can end in horror.

[i]Fantastic![/i]  Very different feel from the main game and other corner boards; tons of ways to make money and tons of stuff to spend it on.  Pretty much solves the problem of being filthy rich and having nothing but crap to buy, akin to an old school episode of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;:  &quot;Yeah, I guess I&#039;ll take [i]another[/i] water bottle.&quot;  It&#039;s the standard destination for loin-girding if you&#039;re not getting any love grinding for levels in the wider world.

Also, the Wharf space is terrific:  Pay one gold to warp to any space in the outer or middle regions (!).  This goes a long way to minimize the amount of dicking around required to get to the Warlock&#039;s Cave or Portal of Power.

[b]BUT BEST OF ALL ~[/b] There are several cards ([i]Corrupt Sheriff, Drunken Revelry, Taxation[/i]) that can yank clowns off the Crown of Command [i]and send them straight to jail.[/i]

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Kinda-sorta super-fiddly.  It bogged the game down—but that might be because we had six players and [i]Talisman[/i] proper can drag, time-wise, with more than four.  Looking forward to rerating after a play in the sweet spot.

Otherwise, yeah, [i]dragons.[/i]  I was never really into them, don&#039;t think they&#039;re cool.  I&#039;d probably feel differently if I were a huge Anne McCaffrey nut, or had smoked a dragon-shaped bong in junior high, or owned a collection of those pewter-n-crystal statuettes... but, alas, I&#039;m not, I haven&#039;t, and I don&#039;t.</comment>				</item>

UPDATE:  This is probably the easiest 10 I&#039;ve ever given a game or expansion.  The extra characters and spells are almost worth the price alone, with the entire dungeon region and massive stack of dungeon cards acting merely as sweetener...

So much to love in here, like when the Summoning Circle gets clogged with an entire zoo of awfulness that no mortal can conquer, or the fact that it ups the burn rate on characters (we went through four character deaths—before the [i]purple-lightning-leaping-from-my-mouth-when-I-scream-your-name[/i] ending—in a three-player game).

Makes the game longer, almost twice as long for us, but I don&#039;t know how much of that was due to the fact that we all crammed in and oscillated in and out of the dungeon instead of ramping cleanly toward the Crown of Command.

UP-UPDATE:  Played it as a stand-alone with the kids.  [i]Talisman[/i] in 30 minutes!</comment>				</item>

UPDATE:

[imageid=1575978 original]
So the Leprechaun pops into existence ♪ [i]Hidilly-Hodilly-Hee[/i] ♬ and skips across the rainbow to his pot o&#039; gold; after filling his pockets he heads off to the raucous stink of the City where he is savaged by a werewolf, robbed of his funds, turned into a toad and evaporated by the Holy Host.

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Four new characters, a [i]ton[/i] of new adventure cards, a huge number of new spells...  not to mention the brand new Warlock Quest deck and, of course, the Grim Reaper Hisself!

This is a no-brainer for every [i]Talisman[/i] fan—fighting over the Grim Reaper (shifting him back and forth in an attempt to get him to land on someone) adds even more balls-out screwage to an already nails-in-a-baseball-bat game.

An absolute must-have for every Talismanite!

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>The stables and Quest Reward cards are cool.  Also, one of the alternative endings is a true co-op game.  Nice!

As for characters, the Dread Knight is pretty much the only one my #1 son will play—he comes with a graveyard-regenerating warhorse and gains a spell for every enemy he defeats.  [i]Bad.  Ass.[/i]  I&#039;m partial to the Magus purely because he gets lugged around by a bevy of oiled slaves in his fabulous sedan chair.

[i][b]L[/b]ife is hard and the Gods are cruel; we toil for their amusement and even our best, most heroic efforts are but castles in the sand before the rushing tide. The Crown of Command dangles as a carrot on the end of a very beaty stick, existing only to see who will neck-stab whom for the illusion of control. We go now, doughty adventurers, hopping across this stage as toads to make the Gods—and perhaps ourselves—laugh. In the end, some lucky bastard will &quot;win&quot;—though he or she will most likely be consumed in capricious flames whence the curtain falls on this pointless shadow play.[/i]

[microbadge=2915]

This is NOT a nostalgia rating—I never got a chance to play this as a kid, teen, or college student.  Though I probably would have spent an awful lot of time doing so if I&#039;d had the chance...

This is a GREAT nerd party/time-waster/beer, pretzels &amp; potty-mouth game.  It has clumsy, outdated mechanics, &quot;unfair&quot; amounts of luck, and the ancient, tired and beaten-to-death [i]Lord of the Rings/D&amp;D[/i] rip-off theme.

And I love it.

This is, in many ways, the Ultimate &quot;Gone-Stupid&quot; Game.  You can pull your brain out of gear and just coast along; it&#039;s one for those times when you would like to play a game, but life has hammered you down to the point where you just want to go &quot;guh.&quot;

So roll a die, pull a card, read the result aaand...

ENJOY!

UPDATE:  Many people decry the random, binary movement system (roll a die and choose either right or left) but this simplicity is part of what makes [i]Talisman[/i] great—it&#039;s the only game of its ilk in which downtime is not an issue.  While [i]Runebound[/i] begins to drag at three players (and becomes intolerable with any more), [i]Talisman[/i] can support the full compliment of players and the turns literally whiz around the table.  Roll, pick, do the thing, pass the dice.  It&#039;s almost a party game, it&#039;s so fast.

PS.  The new Fantasy Flight upgrade is fab!  Looking very forward to a whole mess of expansions...

UP-UPDATE:  With renewed family interest this has been hitting the table as a weekly event!  The good news, other than getting to play one of my favorite &quot;weird storytelling&quot; games, is that all the kids are hot to paint the scads of minis.  Several nights now I&#039;ve gone to sleep only to wake to finished minis in the morning.  If you can engineer this effect for yourself I highly recommend it.

The only minor downer is that what makes this game fantastic is also the one thing that can kill it.  The utterly random element, so brilliant as a jumping-off point for spit-takes—like when the Leprechaun gets the Princess as a follower and ends up being lugged around in a front-facing baby carrier with a boob on each shoulder—can make the game excruciatingly slow when the cards don&#039;t come out in a useful manner.  After a couple of games of watching others level up ferociously while I got in multiple fights with a Royal Decree, three Horse Stables, several Bags of Gold, and a New Age strip-mall (the Mage, Healer and some dude hawking tie-dyed bedsheets decided to clog up the Hidden Valley), I&#039;ve come to realize that more than anything else this game requires [i]stamina.[/i]
[floatright][imageid=1374144 small]
[size=7]Fig. 1 — [i]!!![/i][/size][/floatright]
With all the Adventure Cards from all the expansions, I&#039;m thinking I might need to go through and trim the deck down to tighten up the game... though I&#039;m conflicted, as [i]Talisman[/i] really is about embracing pure chaos and not every story should follow standard Fantasy tropes.  Sometimes it&#039;s okay if the Ogre Chieftain&#039;s saga is one of administration, finances and horse-trading.

All the nudging and winking could topple the thematic balance either way.

If you draw a straight line 25,000-years-long between the two data points of the Venus of Willendorf and this game you end up underscoring the fact that men are filthy pigs who, for reasons known only to Nature, can become violently erect at the sight of a boob-shaped cloud.

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>&quot;...if only you spoke Hovitos.&quot;

An enjoyable, light family game as long as everyone plays in a timely manner.  &quot;Stop the thinky!  &#039;Thinky&#039; won&#039;t make Tutankhamen&#039;s death mask materilize!&quot;  The mechanism for variability of the turn order is probably the neatest trick in the box, and where most of the actual game happened for me.  Carefully choosing what to do to set yourself up for multiple turns in a row, or at least make your turn come sooner rather than later, is very cool.  And, just like in real life, if you don&#039;t know much but spend a lot of time talking about it you can become more famous than the person who actually does the work...

(Also, contrary to the rumors, &quot;mummy-Jesus&quot; is NOT one of the artifacts you can dig up in Palestine.)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A not-bad social cardgame for [i]D&amp;D[/i] nerds (like me).  Supposedly a game played for stakes, but far too chaotic for that.  You&#039;re better off playing 20-deck Baccarat.  It&#039;s impossible to bring skill to bear—there are something like 11 suits and each one has a unique distribution of card values.  So it&#039;s impossible to keep track of what&#039;s been played and have that information inform your future play.  That makes it primarily a game of chance with almost no opportunities for skill.  Not that that&#039;s all bad.  It&#039;s just that no one in their right minds should confuse this with Poker...

With the right group it can be a fun, chaotic post-[i]D&amp;D[/i] session night-ender.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>[i]You show up at the bad guys&#039; hideout with a squad of shivering militiamen, enough daggers for one to stab while two watch, some torches and a donkey laden with picnic baskets.  Next stop:  LEGEND.[/i]

This is my first foray into the &quot;deck building&quot; genre; I&#039;m simultaneously glad I waited and slapping myself for not jumping in earlier.  

[boardgame=36218]Dominion[/boardgame]&#039;s theme makes my head glaze over with the whole &quot;impress the king with the most victory points&quot; thing—I&#039;m much more drawn to the &quot;longest trail of dead&quot; theme.  I ignored [boardgame=53953]Thunderstone[/boardgame] for the longest time due to my misunderstanding that it was merely a re-themed clone... and just about the time I realized the truth there was talk of [i]Dragonspire[/i] coming out as a stand-alone starter set.

And so I waited.  Almost two years.

Two years I could&#039;ve—[i]should&#039;ve[/i]—been playing [i]Thunderstone[/i] and expansions.

On the theme-side it&#039;s laid on pretty thick, with all the usual fantasy tropes and more than a few nods to [rpg=191]Dungeons &amp; Dragons[/rpg] and the [i]Heavy Metal[/i] movie, which I appreciate and find charming.

As for how it plays, it&#039;s quick and painless.  Not having played—or even seen—any deck building game I had little idea of how it worked, even after reading the rules.  Our first game snapped the ambiguities into crystal focus after only a couple of turns.  It&#039;s really very simple.  You choose one of three actions on your turn:

• Discard one of your cards from the game,

• Buy a card from the village, or

• Kill a monster in the dungeon.

In no time at all it&#039;s obvious which of these your hand is best suited for.  The turns whip around the table, often getting back to you before you&#039;ve reshuffled your deck.  The speed of play is a cool, and unexpected, aspect.

About the shuffling: I enjoy it a great deal—the feel, the sound, the [i]monkey-having-something-to-do[/i] bit.  If you don&#039;t like shuffling, this is going to kill you.

The end result is a pleasant diversion—it&#039;s pretty, the theme is comfortably familiar with enough new stuff to keep it interesting, and the play is quick and satisfying.  This will probably end up as a 10 given that each tableau is unique and the fine expansions only serve to crank the variation toward the exponential.

[microbadge=19703]

[size=7]*FIXED:  We use only one of each trap card.  So, yeah, this means some of them go from six instances to a mere two in the dungeon, but having them twang off twice in an entire game is more exciting than watching a clump of four grind someone&#039;s turn into a drudgery of card-flipping for everyone.[/size]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>50</numplays>			<comment>[center][size=6][COLOR=#878787]LIFETIME GAME [microbadge=28495]:star:[microbadge=28496] &quot;PLAY FOREVER&quot;[/COLOR][/size][/center]

Is it [i]Whist[/i] on steroids?  [i]Poker[/i] on Ketamine?  [i]UNO[/i] on HGH wrung from the livers of Third World children?

[i]No.[/i]

[i]Tichu[/i] is the stretch Hummer full of coked-out hookers of card games.  It&#039;s just plain nuts and makes my scrotum tingle with that &quot;gotta-gamble&quot; feeling.

And the best part is:  YOU CAN PLAY IT WITH A STANDARD DECK.  Just buy two decks, strip the jokers out of one and ditch the other 52, scrawl on them jokers with a Sharpie and you&#039;re good to go.  [i]Tichu[/i] anywhere, anytime.  No proprietary deck needed!

PS.  The 6p game blows, and not in the good way.  You don&#039;t get enough cards to build anything competitive—and chances are, you&#039;ll get a fistful of crap and sit in the stink watching everyone else play.  This really, [i]really[/i] wants to be a 4p-only game.

PPS.  The top end is kind of flat.  There&#039;s the initial learning curve of figuring out what the hell &quot;good play&quot; is, then there&#039;s figuring out how to pull off a Tichu and a Grand, and then there&#039;s mastering good partner play (to go out 1-2).  Beyond that—well, things just kind of flatten out and the decision space you arrive in is a lot smaller than the one you imagined while hacking your way upward to the top of [i]Tichu[/i] Mountain.  It ends up like this:  Once you&#039;ve mastered all the preceding problems, the game just comes down to 

1) Getting good cards, and 

2) Not blowing it with bone-headed play.  

And that&#039;s... just about it.  There&#039;s very little you can do with a crap hand; there&#039;s really no such thing as clever defensive play with a fistful of junk.  You just get to sit and take it in the face like a pornstar.  I used to rate this game a 10 as I was making my way up...  Now that I&#039;ve topped out it&#039;s really an 8.  It&#039;s still a great game—it&#039;s just that the luck/skill ratio is out of whack such that skill cannot overcome bad luck.

	<numplays>50</numplays>			<comment>A feather-light gateway game that neatly unhorses [gameid=13] as the premier intro to hobby boardgaming.*  Surprisingly tense for such a simple setup.  You get to play tactically in the now, maneuver for mid-range goals as well as nurture an overall strategy.  Can be taught and grokked in moments; bright colors and beautiful art design make it a sensual pleasure to play.  Rating is probably slightly higher for newbies and slightly lower for hardcore gamers.  Still, an excellent way for veterans of the psychic wars to disengage, drop the intellect into neutral and just coast pleasantly along as a warm-up, a night-ender or as a relaxing activity when otherwise impaired.

UPDATE:  Okay, it&#039;s just Rummy with scoring sets on a board, and secret scoring goals on the Ticket cards.  And like Rummy it&#039;s a mild social game.  An &quot;eat, drink &amp; be merry with good friends&quot; game.  Played seriously or in silence it&#039;s stupid.  It&#039;s for chillin&#039; while counting cards.

UP-UPDATE:  The only way I can play this game and maintain my sanity anymore is to pretend the board is the yarn map at FBI headquarters where they&#039;re tracking all those random railway murders.  Why did I have to get to Little Rock so damn bad?

The Legendary Asia map is neat even if they only hint, in a sideways fashion, at the Yeti taking his due from every trip over the frozen passes.  It&#039;s just a little bit sad, though, that the majestic beastmen have become accustomed to the regularity of train timetables, captive and lazy with the development of a taste for human flesh.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[b]About that 2p dummy player:[/b]

I was extremely leery of the dummy player aspect as I dislike fiddly overhead—especially in light two-player games—but I ended up pleasantly surprised.

Players take turns running the dummy player by drawing a ticket card and claiming a single route as indicated by text at the bottom of the card.  If there is no text then no route is claimed; otherwise the human player chooses which color the dummy snags.  This allows for some mild blocking as you&#039;ll tend to choose the color your opponent has been collecting and/or the one you don&#039;t have much or any of (so you don&#039;t block yourself).

In the end it&#039;s painless and necessary if you&#039;re playing competitively; if you&#039;re doing it purely as a pastime it&#039;s probably too much and you&#039;ll want to skip it to prevent rage-pooping.

The dummy player made the game tense, tight and forced both of us to rejigger our plans as we played.  I can&#039;t see doing two-player without it as the bridge toll tokens add a delicious extra dimension of planning, hard choices and scoring.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Several plays with my wife, not sure what to say about it yet...  It manages to evoke some of the same feelings as the board game, and the nasty knob can be turned up or down as the players wish.  The memory aspect is minimal.  After our first intentionally nasty game (lying in wait to purposefully torpedo each other&#039;s efforts), I rather like it.

Will update as plays continue...

UPDATE:  Plays did not continue.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Takes a light game and froths it into ghost-meringue.  Rolling dice is fun, and that&#039;s pretty much all you&#039;re gonna get out of this.  The whole experience is nothing but scrotum-tingly gamblin&#039;... but even that bit is castrated by only having one re-roll.

In the end this is just about the equipment:  if you like the clatter of dice in a cup and want to do that while you ride tickets, go for it.  Otherwise, I had the mad desire to play real [i]Ticket to Ride[/i] while playing this.

UPDATE:  I&#039;m liking this more and more.  It makes the game super-short, and it&#039;s really easy to pull off some spectacular blocking.  If the game were longer with screwage of that magnitude, it would just piss people off.  If the game were just as short and everyone had to play like Fonzie, it&#039;d be boring.  As is, it&#039;s the perfect mix—a completely different game from [i]Ticket to Ride[/i] proper.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>More variation to breathe new life into a not-so-old classic.  A fistful of new destination tickets and a couple of different play modes mean this one&#039;s got a few more miles left in it.  (To be fair, the new play modes are nothing more than small tweaks—they don&#039;t make it feel like a whole new game, just the old game with a minor twist or two.)

The US-themed full-sized cards are a nice touch—we had been using an extra set of [i]TTR: Europe[/i] cards.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This game changes dramatically with each added player, i.e., 2, 3 &amp; 4p games are all radically different in feel.  Best to play with a minute-timer or pre-agreed turn time limits—each turn has a mathematically optimal move which can take some people decades to find.  Better to force intuition with some form of time limit.  Or public humiliation.</comment>				</item>

[microbadge=33524]

UPDATE:  Delivered, on time and gorgeous-looking!  These guys got Kickstarter [i]down[/i].  The gameplay&#039;s... [i]there[/i]... I&#039;m just not quite sure how I feel about it yet.  Reserving judgment until I get more plays under my belt.  The good news is that we all want more of those.

The single sour note so far is the godawful planet names.  I&#039;m guessing they must be named after backers?  Which is cool for exactly one person—and then the rest of us are left scratching our heads wondering why this awesome planet (as far as the art is concerned, anyway) has a name that sounds suspiciously like some random dude.  Where they should be cool, evocative and memorable they&#039;re instead clunky, nonsensical, and difficult to parse.  [i]Bummer.[/i]

[b]Note to Game Designers:[/b]  I will pay extra to [i]not[/i] have backer faces and names in a game.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Intriguing due to the tiny footprint, this one is best met with expectations likewise constrained.  It isn&#039;t a &quot;big game in a small package&quot;, it&#039;s just small all around; an ambitious filler, really.  A certain level of whimsy and suspension of gamer-disbelief is required to enjoy it.  Trying to make a meal out of this [i]amuse-bouche[/i] will leave you hungry and disappointed.

As is usual for Kickstarter games this one looks great but feels vaguely brain damaged—I&#039;m sure there are degenerate strategies and &quot;broken&quot; powers lurking beneath the surface, to be found, mercilessly exploited and then dishearteningly house-ruled until we can&#039;t stand to touch it anymore.  How many plays in the box, then?  Who can say—but more than would be expected when engaged with a light touch and lowered expectations, certainly.  Besides, it&#039;s short enough that even a thorough hosing is bearable.

After 3 games of 2p I&#039;m not sure it works at that count—whoever gets the upper hand in resources and attacks on the first turn essentially wins the game, making it enormously uninteresting.  I suppose we could be Fonzies and ignore each other for a while... but that just feels weird when the win is dangling right there for the taking.</comment>				</item>

Every player has the opportunity to purchase an action during every other players&#039; turn—requiring you to be constantly engaged in the play.  There is no downtime.  Add to this the fact that almost every game piece is a tradeable commodity and you have the ultimate negotiation game.  Highly recommended.

Our 2004 copy got soaked by a leaky cooler while camping in 2015—the game itself escaped harm but the box needed to be dried out over several days and reinforced with hasty duct tape.  The box still does the job, it&#039;s just that all those neat planes have been rendered as eccentric as potato chips.  Around here we call that &quot;character&quot;.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Epic in every dimension.  And, despite all the ISC brouhaha, it plays just fine right  out of the box.

UPDATE:  This is still a great game, the experience growing more rich and nuanced as we become more familiar with it.  This is definitely one of those games that requires repeat plays—difficult for most, I know, as the first couple of plays can be excruciatingly long and fraught with error.  All I can say is stick with it; like the monster games of old the wonders in this box are only revealed through familiarity.

[b]ISC and other tweaking:[/b]

The best version of this game is played with the Age of Empire &amp; The Ancient Throne variants.  AoE, found in the rulebook, lays all the public objectives out in a row and allows for long-range strategic planning.  AT, an official variant found on Fantasy Flight&#039;s website, changes the ISC to 1VP if you control Mecatol Rex—in addition, it allows you to earn as many VP objectives as you qualify for, all at once.*  It makes for a longer game (with no 2VP clock counting it down) but with far more interaction, with emphasis on the ACTION!!!


[size=7]*This is also now the Imperial II Strategy Card found in [thing=22821]Shattered Empire[/thing].[/size]

[b]Board setup for more interaction:[/b]

Take the best double systems and place them randomly around Mecatol Rex (so the first ring is made up of resource- and influence-rich gems of the Empire).  Then build the other rings as normal.  This prevents the usual layout of the galaxy—with players each residing in their own premium &quot;turtle pockets&quot; that are bordered with crap while the throneworld of Mecatol Rex languishes in a backwater ghetto.  Surrounding it with double systems forces players to move fleets up the ladder and into sweaty proximity around Mecatol Rex for a turn (or so) of hard stares and eye-twitching until someone pulls the trigger on the Last War and makes the jump for Mecatol.  With everyone having a fleet one hex out, the game becomes a Rolling Storm of Woe mitigated only by political shenannigans and shady trading...

UP-UPDATE:  Aw, hell... who am I kidding?  With the advent of the [thing=22821]Shattered Empire[/thing] expansion, this is a rock-solid 10.  Slathered miles-deep in theme, diplomacy &amp; intrigue, massive space fleet engagements &amp; ground combat—there&#039;s nothing else like it.  Nothing even comes close.

It doesn&#039;t so much &quot;fix&quot; or change the nature of [i]Twilight Imperium[/i] as it just makes it more of what it already is.  Not just recommended, but required.  (It bumped [i]TI3[/i] from an eight to a solid-forever 10 for me.)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Nifty for a couple of reasons:

- It&#039;s not like anything else.

- It&#039;s fast.

- Non-gamers and newbies can jump right in.

Remember that for those folks anything more than three rules is complicated and intimidating.  Getting into this one is as easy as dumping the pieces in front of everyone, grabbing the sand timer and saying:  &quot;You need to completely cover the shape on your card with your puzzle pieces.  First one done screams

[size=18][i][b]&#039;UBONGO-OHHH!!!&#039;[/b][/i][/size]

and runs around the table slapping everyone else in the head.&quot;

Okay, that last part is actually a house rule.  There are a couple of other things, like second and third place rewards, and the free draws from the bag, but you really don&#039;t need to know about any of that crap to get started.

Also, being an [i][b]EX[size=10]X[/size]XTREEEM!!![/b][/i] game it goes better with a belly full of Mountain Dew while hanging upside down from a rope.

PS.  Winning at this probably means you&#039;ll be rounded up and shot into space on the tip of a nuclear missile; it&#039;s okay, though—the rest of the chimps get euthanized.

Otherwise, you&#039;ve got a one-way ticket to the Worry Wharf.  What this really needs is some real-time LARP-style hand-to-hand combat rules to spice it up.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>A not-awful night-ender/filler if played fast, loose and goofy.  And only every once in a while.  Seems overarchingly dominated by luck at first (with all the die rolls) but there are definite strategies for racking up points while remaining sane long enough to cross the 100-point finish line.  Because the game could still come down to nothing more than Lady Luck&#039;s fickle bon-bon-eating hand wave and outstay its welcome it&#039;s best to attack this like a 10 minute party game.  Anything more than that will come off like a legless zombie—it will stink and drag.

Options that help tremendously:

- Allow all words that appear in the Mythos, even (especially?) the proper nouns.

- Allow the nearly insane (those with a single sanity point left) to spell anything at all, including single letters and gibberish.  As long as they shout it at the top of their lungs as they play it.

- Don&#039;t be a &quot;Scrabble Dictionary only&quot; stickler.  As we&#039;re fond of saying around here, &quot;It ain&#039;t that kind of movie, Starbuck.&quot;  We allowed slang, comic book sound effects, the word [i]caca[/i] and even known misspellings if they resulted in comic effect (intended or not).  Does it break the game?  Hardly.  It [i]is[/i] the game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Not nearly as nifty as it appears.  The game has a tendency to lock up horribly, with players passing in turn, unable to do anything, often ending the game before it could develop into something interesting.  Even when it does manage to wheeze and chug along, it usually comes down to a four-letter-word cussathon with various stacked permutations of words like &quot;DUCK&quot;.  (And just in case yer wonderin&#039;, I do has a Lit degree, so vocab ain&#039;t the problem.)  Play Scrabble instead.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>[size=18][b]ONLY THE STRONG[/b][/size]

This is pure, unapologetic, stomp-the-leader PvP in the same vein as [gameid=1927] and [thing=104710]Wiz-War[/thing].  It all comes down to [i]take-that[/i] card play, requiring constant groin-booting, constant expectation of multiple boots in your own groin AT ALL TIMES and a solid [i]how-to-lace-18-eyelets[/i] understanding of the contents of the deck.

It is the antithesis of all things Eurogame—in fact, it is the shadow of the very tongue that licked Euros from the original ice so long ago, hot, hateful and mean-spirited.

This means two things:

1.  Most people on this site will be severely allergic to it.

2.  A single play tells you [i]nothing[/i] about what it actually does.

It was clear to me after that single play—as a rabid fan of [i]take-that[/i] card games—that intimate knowledge of the deck will cause the game to open up like a lacerated artery and splash our laughing faces with color to please the Gods.  We really didn&#039;t get the hang of it until about halfway through when we suddenly figured out how to deploy triple groin-bootings, how to chain cards like the stanzas of a Saga, how to monkey-wrench those chains, how to get more cards to keep it up... and how best to use the sea monster.  (Hint:  CONSTANTLY.)

You know by now whether or not you like this sort of thing.  It has &quot;Viking&quot; in the title, and those people weren&#039;t famous for gathering sea cubes and converting them into salt-fish disks to impress the Jarl.  We know them for their &quot;cultural outreach program&quot; where they aggressively traded iron for gold.  This is lots of that.

Besides, how can you not like a game where you can make people vomit and/or throw them overboard?  [i]Seriously.[/i]*


[size=7]*I mean, have you even read the original Norse myths?  Not the ones that have been scrubbed for children, but the ones where Thor hurls a boulder into a menstruating giantess&#039; vagina, for actual example.[/size]

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Decent fun, but the time required to set up and play a standard game is crippling (4 hours plus).  Keep it down to 500 points per side on a 4&#039;x4&#039; board AND PLAY FAST with a bloated goat-load of house rules (like players alternating turns squad by squad) and it ain&#039;t a half bad way to spend 40 minutes.  But then I guess it isn&#039;t 40k anymore, is it?

[imageid=257474 small]
UPDATE:  Aw, who am I kidding?  I&#039;m a sucker for this stuff.  Love the universe, love the art, love the modeling, painting and terrain-making.  And the game&#039;s not half bad as a &quot;roll-all-the-dice-you-own-no-really&quot; kind of game.  And I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m assaulting you this turn... if I&#039;m not misjudging that gap.  [bites knuckle]

[imageid=257469 small]
UP-UPDATE:  8 --&gt; 6  I&#039;m at the point now where I&#039;ll actively avoid playing this... It&#039;s a fine-enough game, no doubt—everything I said in the preceding paragraph is still true—it&#039;s just that I&#039;ve had my fill.  I&#039;ve pored over the books, painstakingly painted the armies, handcrafted the terrain, and played the hell out of it with innumerable memorable games, burning through four editions (2nd-5th).  In the end it feels like a middle school crush, a soft spot in my heart that is far superior in concept than actual execution.  It was only ever going to go so far, and it did, and so I am done.

Yesterday I purged all my terrain; it was taking up valuable space in the garage while entropy nibbled away with its inexorable teeth, leaving dings, dents, and a slow snow of paint flakes and flocking...

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This game has the best background universe in all gamedom, hands down.  Devilishly baroque, medieval and futuristic simultaneously.  The actual game part—when you have the minis arrayed for battle on a big, green table—is really a small portion of what this is all about.  Taken purely for the game aspect it&#039;s kinda thin.  Where this shines is as an entire hobby-system:  perusing the background material, planning an army, collecting the minis, modeling and painting, hand-crafting convincing terrain.  It&#039;s the total package that gets the 8.  No other minis game even comes close to touching all those nubbins so completely.

[q=HiveGod]8 --&gt; 6  I&#039;m at the point now where I&#039;ll actively avoid playing this... It&#039;s a fine-enough game, no doubt—it&#039;s just that I&#039;ve had my fill.  I&#039;ve pored over the books, painstakingly painted the armies, handcrafted the terrain, and played the hell out of it with innumerable memorable games, burning through four editions (2nd-5th).  In the end it feels like a middle school crush, a soft spot in my heart that is far superior in concept than actual execution.  It was only ever going to go so far, and it did, and so I am done.[/q]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>An [i]incredible[/i] value for beginner and veteran alike—a bucket-load of better-than-average minis for Ork/Space Marine players, scatter die and blast templates, and all the rules in a super-handy handbook (small form-factor paperback).

It&#039;s kind of funny to claim I own this, as I&#039;ve already cannibalized and parted out the entire box contents:

- Orks, dice, templates and rulebook to my sons

- Terminators into my previously-raided Space Hulk game

- Space Marine minis into my bitz box.

I&#039;m using the box proper to hold all the random 40k crap—rule book, dice, templates, rulers &amp; tokens.

UPDATE:  Marking as &quot;previously owned&quot; for the sake of honesty.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Really, really wanted to like this more than I do.  The Warhammer world is fun, the art is fantastic, and the component quality* and presentation are like a gingerbread house in the middle of the woods.

In the end the problem, to quote my son, is that &quot;it&#039;s not [i]Magic[/i].&quot;

Not that it has to be, or even that it&#039;s trying to be.  But I get where he&#039;s coming from:  why play this when you could be playing [boardgame=463][i]Magic: The Gathering[/i][/boardgame]?  It&#039;s a better game, a deeper game, a more satisfying game.  And if we&#039;re going to be playing a fantasy-themed card game for the next 20 minutes, I&#039;d rather throw some [i]Magic[/i] around.

Includes, from [i]The Corruption Cycle[/i]:

[gameid=55916]
[gameid=57940]
[gameid=58157]
[gameid=61739]
[gameid=65217]

Also:

[gameid=63787]


[size=7]*With the exception of different-sized cards in the expansions.  I hate card sleeves, and when the cards are even fractionally larger or smaller or funny-shaped it affects the shuffle.  (And, no, pile sorting doesn&#039;t randomize the cards—it just makes sure no two cards are next to each other.)  If you overhand or monge shuffle with different sized cards, they end up clumped by size.  Riffle shuffling is better, but the bigger cards get mangulated faster.  Ah, well.  I should count myself lucky to have such problems, no?[/size] </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>The absolute best implementation of table-top combat I&#039;ve ever seen.  The rules can be explained and understood in under two minutes; the simultaneous movement turns and superfast combat resolution make the game feel like a real WWI dogfight, with all the attendant frustrations, elations and terror.  

The rule-set is excellent—neither too much nor too little.  It plays fast and  captures the milieu perfectly.  I was amazed how quickly I adapted to the different performance characteristics of each plane; getting the results I wanted out of a given manuever deck became deftly intuitive.

The only thing missing is the pistol on a lanyard for when you catch fire...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>[i]It started with a prison shanking and ended with the detonation of a two-angels-fucking superweapon.  Somewhere in the middle there was an ecstatic frenzy over a heart-shaped box carved from a magic tree, a zeppelin assault with tin-man–firing cannons, and a puppet show no one will ever forget, no matter how hard they try...[/i]

This is what I like to do in pretty much every game, formalized and made the entire point of the exercise.  The rules are somewhat obtuse and seem at odds with what they&#039;re trying to achieve, which is probably why this beautiful experiment fails so often for so many, as it&#039;s a fragile thing that requires the right people to play it the right way with the right mindset in order to properly come together, inflate with hot air, and soar.  But man, if you can pull it off it&#039;s slick as hell.

Just ignore any gamey, fun-murdering card counting bullshit and focus on the storyteller&#039;s maxim:

[b]SOMETHING WENT WRONG[/b]

And everything&#039;ll be just fine.

Or not.


[size=7]Note:  For our first game we just kinda went for it—there were plenty of rules irregularities but the story came through intact and everyone had a fine time.  For our next game I&#039;ll suggest playing cards into a stack instead of a line so the magnitude of cards isn&#039;t reflexively obvious, and maybe judging the &quot;winner&quot; of the story-bit with a vote, using the number of cards played as a tie-breaker.  While a vote won&#039;t work in mechanism-focused super-competitive groups (who shouldn&#039;t be playing this anyway) it will for us, as we prize a good story over winning or losing.[/size]</comment>				</item>

Absolute best implementation of the [gameid=1116] (et al.) family.

Since we play with a deck bashed together from several &quot;Dragon Back&quot; Bicycle decks, the Wizards glide on ramps of moonlight and execute breathtaking 540 Cabs and Superman Seat Grabs that conjure up hosts of devils with which to have congress; meanwhile, the happy-go-lucky Jester biffs it on his first Bunny Hop and ends up in the ditch, crying [i]a-bloo-bloo-bloo[/i] on account of having lost toes in the spokes.  You&#039;d stop to help him but, you know, he smells like pee.

PS. Always, [i]always[/i] play with the &quot;Drunken Canadian rule&quot; whereby the dealer cannot make a bid that brings the total number of bids = to the number of tricks in the hand.  This way someone is [i]guaranteed[/i] to get served up a platter of finger sandwiches—no, [i]really[/i]—[i]finger[/i] sandwiches.  Most probably made from [i]their own fingers[/i].

PPS.  Special hats-off thanks to

[username=kuhrusty]
for initiating me into the world of [i]Wizard[/i] and for creating the Anna-Monster.  While bagging second place over you that one time remains a singular [i]Greatest Gaming Moment EVAR[/i], it was a soul-soaring thing watching you vibrate with rage as Anna whipped all of us so very thoroughly—yet adorably—like Torquemada in a Pikachu cosplay outfit.</comment>				</item>

UPDATE:  Nothin&#039; wrong with the game itself—it just turns out I&#039;m not a [i]World of Warcraft[/i] fan.  I don&#039;t MMORPG (pronounced &quot;more-pig&quot;) and I never really got into the turn-based version back in the day.  If this had been themed as a [i]Runebound[/i] adventure game, It would get played to death around here.  ([i]Runebound[/i]?  In less than four hours?  Yes, please!)  As it is, the license kills it.  Might as well be about Hannah Montana* for all I care.

GAME ENGINE:  8++
THEME:  4-

Dear GeekBuddies:  You gots 40 bucks worth of &#039;splainin&#039; t&#039; do!

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Quick and bloody from the get-go.  The endgame usually involves desperate hand-to-hand in both palaces simultaneously, each player racing for the checkmate.  I find this game to be a nice break from (sometimes) head-hurty European chess.

On a side note:  &quot;Westernized&quot; pieces are for amateurs.  Use that big, pulsing brain of yours and learn the Chinese pieces.  It&#039;s not that hard.  If I can do it (my brain is not all that big and does not pulse) so can you.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A fun gambling exercise where one must quickly calculate the odds of success (in rolling different [i]Yahtzee[/i] combinations) vs. your risk (chips bet) and the expected payout.  If you suck at these things, you will get fleeced until you are chapped and bleeding.  (Of course, you could always trust your gut and hope your intuition is hooked into your math co-processor somehow.)

One aspect I particularly enjoy is the ability to bet for or against the shooter&#039;s success; if folks give you the vote of no confidence by betting against you, you can throw it back in their faces by making your numbers and taking their money.  This allows for ripsnorting levels of crowage.

Not recommended for children (or general non-gamer family) as the odds calculation can be troublesome for them, leading to early bankruptcy and player elimination.

All in all a great party game for adults.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>22</numplays>			<comment>AKA &quot;Yahtzee Free Fire Zone&quot;

Interactive [i]Yahtzee[/i] where you have to wait a turn to bank the roll you just made, during which time anyone else at the table can steal it by rolling a higher set, e.g., if you make a full house and someone else gets a better full house, they can steal your roll (this even works with Yahtzees).

Fun with familial trash-talk.

UPDATE:  &quot;The card you lost was only a two-pointer, while she stole my 10-point Yahtzee... so [screw] YOU.&quot;

WARNING:  May make wine squirt out nose.

UP-UPDATE:  A mega-hit with my regular gaming group.  Who knew?  I only got it for family &amp; the odd couples&#039; gaming... but once my group played it EVERYONE ran out and bought a copy.  It&#039;s a staple at our game nights &amp; days.

This is, truly, [i]Yahtzee[/i] with down and dirty Ameritrash sensibilities.  It is a five-dice abstraction of groin-kicks and curb-stomping.

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>This has been a HUGE hit with my tween/teen sons &amp; nephews.  They love the ease of play, the ebb and flow of chaos, and especially the zombies.

UPDATE:  I&#039;m not going to rate this as it&#039;s more of a pastime, something &quot;game-like&quot; to do while waiting for those last couple of people to show up and form a quorum for anything else.  We&#039;re comfortable noodling around with it and then calling it done when it&#039;s time to ditch it.  It fills that niche nicely, and as such it pulls a six or seven.  As an actual game (e.g., played to completion of the win conditions) it rates far lower.

UP-UPDATE:  I lied.  I call it at a six.  Painless but not necessary.

This rates a 5 played with the rules as written out of the box.  With the proper amount of house-rule spackle this can climb as high as a 7 or even an 8 with the right music, mood and people.

How much spackle?  [i]All of it.[/i]  You&#039;ll want to come up with new rules for movement, combat, endgame and victory conditions, using any combination of your own tasty brains, the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/3063]Quick(er) Play Rules[/url], [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/Yugblad]Yugblad&#039;s[/url] suggestions:

[q=Yugblad]1. Throw out the rulebook.
2. Pick and choose from the variant rules on the Geek - remember to keep it SIMPLE!
3. Do not lay down tiles after finding the helipad.
4. Forget counting &quot;dead&quot; zombies for the winner - this is a kill-the-zombie-to-escape game. Let the most bloodthirst player place the helipad.
5. When a player dies, have him/her/them control the zombies, etc.
6. Trim the card deck to a custom-picked 50-60 cards. NO more, no less. Keep it 50/50 to screwage/benefit cards.
7. Use a timer - this keeps a panicky atmosphere ticking over.
8. Mount the town tiles on 2mm-thick card.
9. Use the subway expansion.[/q]
and the smorgasbord of rules salad on the Twilight Creations website.

I have to admit that I was very put off by this at first—if I wanted to make my own game I would have made my own game, not spent money on an unfinished product.  With time, however, I&#039;ve very much warmed to the idea of Zombies!!! as a sandbox/tool kit experience game, a gaming hot rod that can be fiddled with and tuned until you get the custom ride that perfectly suits you &amp; your game group.

If you dig the theme, have the time and are so inclined to tinker, this is pretty darn good.

My set-up:

[GAMEID=23972]
[GAMEID=31464]: glow-in-the-dark zombies, cards &amp; tiles
