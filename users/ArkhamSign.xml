	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This game is the poster child for &quot;Play before you pay.&quot; We bought it thinking the theme sounded cool. But the components are rather sub-par. It comes with miniatures but no bases for them to stand on so you&#039;ll have to buy your own. No minis representing villains just tiny cardboard chits unless you buy the expansion. The game boards, one for each realm (and by the way this game only comes with 4 despite what the name of the game leads you to believe) are flimsy. The rule book doesn&#039;t layout the game play in any consistent way. And the FAQ serves as the designers trying to be comedians instead of actually answering any questions. We say avoid it. </comment>				</item>

There is a bit of a learning curve for the first few games we think. But that hurdle is easily jumped once you get the game pacing and actions down pat. It is at its heart a resource management game and a fun one to boot.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We have owned both Agents of SMERSH and Tales of the Arabian Nights. Let&#039;s be honest and call a spade a spade. Tales of the Arabian Nights is not a game. It is a choose your own adventure book trying its best to look like a game by adding a board and dice. SMERSH does a bit of a better job by making it a co-op and adding just a touch of strategy &amp; tactics. 
But Above and Below delivers on what most people believed they were getting with those games. Ryan Laukat gives you an actual GAME to go with the storytelling. Worker placement and resource management are key to this game. And there is a very good amount of strategy to it. Gaining resources gets you more money which allows you to build buildings and more workers to get you more points at the end of the game. The exploration action which is where the storytelling comes in is whimsical (written by Ryan and his friends and family) but makes you plan ahead. You need workers to explore successfully. This game only gets a nine because the stories are not as engaging or immersive as they are in Arabian Nights or SMERSH. It more than makes up for that with the game mechanisms but if the stories had a bit more meat to them this game might make it into our top 10. </comment>				</item>

Sure the components look good but so much of it seems to be a random luck fest. Plus there is the whole memory aspect where in the first section of the game you look at tiles to try and determine where you can step safely in a later part of the temple. I HATE  memory games. So that was an almost instant turn off for me. But beyond that the game play isn&#039;t immersive or engaging. So this one is a pass. </comment>				</item>

Collect sets of cards to get more points and whoever has the most points when all the cards are collected wins. A quick, fun filler. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Small box with lots of Analysis Paralysis included. It seems simple. Just place a tile onto the table to expand the island chain around Akrotiri. But ... as the area grows larger and larger and you attempt to place temples among those islands (place six temples and you win) the choices become very wide and varied. Temples are placed according to resource locations on map cards you purchase. As more resources get placed through more tiles being played more options become available for placing temples. So very often you end up staring at the tile in your hand and at all the other tiles already placed trying to figure out if after placing that tile you can place your next temple. What starts out very simple soon becomes a brain burning puzzle. So beware ... it may be a small box. But it is not a small game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We have a number of dice games in our collection and this one ranks as one of the best. You roll the dice then using sets, straights, etc you assign them to get tiles related to provinces, laws or patricians. Then you begin the set collection. However, you only get one use of the dice each turn. So while you might think getting that Britannia province will score the most, if you let that patrician for Germania go your opponents might just take it. The set collection is really quite simple but gives you a bit to think about. An easy yet strategic game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The ultimate gateway game. It doesn&#039;t get any more fun or simple  than this. Three simple actions each turn. Take cash from the bank, buy a building for your Alhmabra or rearrange buildings already in your Alhambra. That&#039;s it. But there is a good amount of strategy in this game mixed with the luck of the card draws from the bank. Heavy Eurogamers might think this is too simple and they are probably right. But it is still so much fun. This game ties Ticket to Ride for our favorite gateway game. It is that good. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We had been staring at this one of the shelf of our friendly neighborhood gaming store for months but were indecisive because there was nothing really about it anywhere review or gameplay wise. So we finally just said to heck with it and bought it. It took us a while to figure out what to do. The rules are , oddly enough, not written very well which is extremely strange given how easy to follow the rules are for Alhambra and Granada (also by Dirk Henn). So we had to slog through the first game trying to decipher what everything meant. The scoring was weird and , again, not explained very well. We were also perplexed by one thing in the game but found out that wasn&#039;t a design mistake. Each round we rolled the dice to see which building we would try and go for but kept getting confused about the allocation until we suddenly realized that our copy had come with 9 white building dice instead of the standard 8. We finally managed to get it sorted out and enjoy the game. It would actually rate close to Alhambra but that rule book just drags it into 7. And if you have Alhambra (and why wouldn&#039;t you) it doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense to get this one as well. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Kingsburg with a sci-fi theme? Well, you&#039;re pretty close but also a bit far off with that description . There are a few differences that make it a whole different bird. Yes. You still allocate resources to build up your particular kingdom/empire. But the worker (dice) placement here can be much more cutthroat. You can very often get blocked out of what you really wanted and have no real recourse. In this game you have the Alien Artifact location which allows you to get cards with certain abilities that can really swing things in your direction. Except for the Leader cards that come with To Forge a Realm there isn&#039;t anything like that in Kingsburg. This one also has the ability to hugely mess with your opponent in a fashion other than just taking the stuff they wanted. The Raider&#039;s Outpost is certainly very close to an attack option but there are ways to mitigate it. The biggest difference of course is the area control aspect of the game. This not only determines the scoring, it gives you awesome abilities later on though other players can battle it out with you for them. All in all Alien Frontiers is an awesome game. Had we not already owned Kingsburg this game might rate a 10 but we so love Kingsburg that its hard to place this complex sibling higher. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>By far the biggest Feld game out there. Why the big box? Well it does at least keep you from having to take that cube tower apart before and after every play. But that&#039;s beside the point. Amerigo is one of Feld&#039;s best. He takes a mechanism ( the cube tower ) and puts it to an entirely different use than in other games that call upon the same devise. Each turn cubes go in and cubes come out. What color cubes come out and how many determine what actions can be done. The cube tower is an excellent way to determine actions in a game like this where there are so many things you want to do to get the points you need to win the game but typically not enough time to get them in. Instead of relying on dice rolls like some of his other games you get the ability to do a variety of actions as the tower allows. Want to be able to build that last plot on your island to complete it and get the points? All you need is for one cube of that color (green) to come out and chances are you might get to do what you want even if the vast majority of the cubes that come out are for building cannons (black). This game can bring out the AP at times especially when you get to the &quot;Tetris&quot; portion of the game trying to fill out your islands with the building tiles. But that doesn&#039;t detract from the way the game plays and the playful mechanism of the cube tower. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The 1st game we ever Kickstarted after seeing a preview by the Dice Tower&#039;s Ryan Metzler. A game of dice rolling and set collection with a theme steeped in a sort of classic horror/jungle trek style. The components for this are awesome though we got the cool dice and player mats through the Kickstarter stretch goals so whether they will come with the game if/when it reaches stores is debatable. We wish the theme was a bit more tied to the mechanics. But it is an overall fun game that is beautiful when it&#039;s all laid out on the table. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The art was good (all of Ryan Lauket&#039;s art designs are fabulous regardless of what game it is) but there was just a lot of fiddliness with this game. The order of the worker placement mattered in conjunction with the number on the worker. The resources were honestly too tight. Plus it never felt like there was the opportunity to get the things done you wanted. I expect worker placement games to be tight but with this is just seems there is too much you need to do in order to get ahead but never the opportunity to do them. When we backed this on Kickstarter it didn&#039;t seem like this was the case in the overview for the campaign. Not sure if the rules changed with the finished product or if we were just reading into it wrong. But it was a pass for us. </comment>				</item>

Alas with fiddly rules &amp; lackluster components it just couldn&#039;t do what Paizo succeeded in doing with Pathfinder.  The art was fantastic. The game itself was just no good. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Stefan Feld hits a home run with this 2-player game. Easy mechanics as well as a lot of take that in a head to head two-player game using dice as its main mechanism. You roll the dice and use them to either get cards into your hand, get money to play those cards from your hand or activate cards already on the table. The game can get cutthroat and nasty at times with cards that make your opponent lose cards, victory pints or money. Plus you are always looking for ways to destroy the cards your opponent has on the table. And with two different end game options : ending a round with more victory points than your foe after all the VP chits have been picked up from the supply or to just run your opponent out of victory points.  If you like 2-player games this is the one for you. </comment>				</item>

A ton of rules that you have to wrestle to the ground? Indeed. 
More components that you can shake a stick at? Confirmed.
3 hour plus game play? You got it.
An immersive world in which you can explore the horror and grandeur of the works of HP Lovecraft? That&#039;s what this game is all about. 
Arkham Horror should be in the top 5 of the themed rankings if you ask us (which you probably aren&#039;t. No worries). We don&#039;t think there are too many more games that &quot;put you there&quot; like AH does. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Yep. We&#039;ve picked up yet another deck builder. It may be our favorite type of game (possibly tied with worker-placement). The theme is a little bit thin and the artwork is so abstract as to be ugly. It works like your standard deck builder but there is one mechanic we don&#039;t care for. To one side is a &quot;cultist&quot; card with only 2 defense that doesn&#039;t move from his position that you are allowed to attack should you have nothing else you can attack in the center display. Honestly you could simply hammer away at that guy throughout the game and possibly win just like that. Not to mention this has some of the WORST artwork in board gaming. It&#039;s kinda hard to look at really. </comment>				</item>

The theme is great as it reminds us of Disney&#039;s &quot;Atlantis : The Lost Empire.&quot; The push your luck element of the worker placement is certainly unique. But those Athenians &amp; Misfortune cards are SO punishing. They hit you hard and trying to mitigate them is just as painful. In all the games we played we never even came close to winning. It is brutal. We like challenge in co-ops but when it honestly seems it is impossible to win that takes all the fun out it. </comment>				</item>

This one is a great game. Granted it is just Bingo! with a Roman theme pasted on (that&#039;s the only thing keeping this one from being a 10) but it is so much fun. Shouting &quot;Ava Caesar!&quot; instead of &quot;Bingo!&quot; just adds to it. This one is certainly staying with us. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Nothing about this version of Fluxx grabbed our attention. While the art is based on Batman : The Animated Series ( a show that I love) , it is an art style that lends itself to animation only. It just doesn&#039;t look good as still art. Plus the game play is plodding whereas we usually find Fluxx to be fast paced. Plus there is a meta-card in the game that gets you a benefit if you&#039;re wearing a Bat-logo shirt! I hate stuff like that in games. It&#039;s why we hate party games. Another miss for Fluxx. </comment>				</item>

The first to use the Commands &amp; Colors system (begging the question why it isn&#039;t called the Battle Cry system) it plays just as easy and flawlessly as Memoir &#039;44 and BattleLore. The problem is its limited game play. You can buy enough Memoir &#039;44 modules that chances are you may never play them all. Plus the original BattleLore has plenty of content too and BattleLore 2.0 is coming out with new additions all the time. But Battle Cry just has the scenarios that come in the box (sans fan additions) so it runs of out replayabilty pretty quickly. It is odd that this game died the way it did. It was even given an anniversary edition but still no new content. If this game did have the kind of content that Memoir did we might be hard pressed to decide which one to keep. But with Battle Cry&#039;s limited content , Memoir &#039;44 wins that challenge hands down. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This game suffers from the same liability for us as Battle Cry. We really don&#039;t need more than one Commands &amp; Colors game. Granted this one is getting the content added to it on a regular basis thanks to Fantasy Flight. As much as we like fantasy, we prefer the real world scenarios of Memoir &#039;44. Plus the way the combat in addition to the magic works , BattleLore 2.0 doesn&#039;t flow as easily in game play as Memoir. But if you like skirmish combat and you are a fantasy fan this is certainly the C&amp;C game for you. </comment>				</item>

Even the exploration of the tiles to conquer them is very cool. However, when it is all said and done, the game comes down to rolling dice. You can try to mitigate that by sending in more troops but even then you can still be beaten by the dice rolling. Now were the combat in this deterministic combined with card play that might work. But the randomness of the dice just ruin the game in our opinion. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I feel like I am just going to be repeating what every one else says about this game. It could be SO GOOD but the Haunt can clutch up this game so bad and so fast. The first half of the game is the best part. You explore the house entering rooms where God only knows what terrors lie in store for you. Cards and tiles give you such flavor text that you cannot help but be drawn into the theme. 
But once the Haunt happens all that tends to fall by the way side. There are so many ways the game can go and there&#039;s no way to know if the game play will continue to work or if it will just break on you right then and there. Plus the haunt can happen so quickly in the right situation that any exploration of the house stops dead robbing the players of what almost everyone universally agrees is the best aspect of the game. 
Plus let&#039;s be honest ... the components are not great. Those character boards are a joke, the card stock is not good and those minis are atrocious. If some one can just fix the second half of the game it might go way up in all gamers&#039; estimation </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Blueprints is a moderately strategic dice-building game with some easy mechanics but fun game play. Drawing the dice from the bag to build up your blueprint feels pretty cool and gives you a sense of accomplishment. The drawbacks that keep it at the current rating ?
1) The rule book is not very well written. We had to check BGG forums quite often to sort it all out. And for a small game like this that&#039;s kind of inexcusable. 
2) There are just too many ways to score for such a small game. You score for the different kinds of dice, you score for the blueprint, you score for the prizes, you score for majority in a certain material. That just seems like complexity for complexity&#039;s sake. 
 Despite these it is still a good filler. Check it out. </comment>				</item>

But then the number on the dice make a difference for how well you can carry out those actions. And there are a lot of actions to take; Building huts, gathering resources, laying out shrines, appeasing the gods, hiring locals for work ,etc. There is a lot to do and you can even block other players out of actions by using the dice set at certain values. On top of that every round you will be trying to fulfill the demands of scoring tiles that become available each and every round. You may only have a certain number at the end of each round so you either score the tile or lose it. Then there is end of game scoring for set collection of different types of workers and jewelry that you buy over the course of the game using money collected each round. So do you stick with just scoring in the short term or sacrifice some of them to score in the long term. It&#039;s a thinky game but fun and looks extremely beautiful on the table even it does take up a lot of that table space. </comment>				</item>

There honestly aren&#039;t too many of his games we&#039;ll enjoy. It&#039;s simple and direct. You get a few decisions to make with a hand of cards you&#039;ve drawn. It is easy and flows very well. No point salad either. Plays in under an hour and is just fun. </comment>				</item>

In it however you are gathering money and/or  cacao beans or building up temples to score points. Each tile the players have allot different numbers of workers to each location they join with their tile. Thus you may have 2 workers on one side that gives you 2 cacao beans and also 1 worker that might give you money. The key in placing your tiles in such a way that it benefits you while giving your opponents nothing or perhaps blocking them out of something completely. This game has flown completely under the radar but is fun, good to look at, has a short play time (25-35 minutes we have found) and has some good strategy and tactics. </comment>				</item>

Just bogs down so fast. And why oh why did FantasyFlight put this game into one of their standard size boxes? It could have just as easy been fitted into a standard expansion size box. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This Carcassonne is a different bird from all the rest as you collect resources in order to load ships to receive points. For us it is just a bit fiddly with the placement of the meeples and the gathering of the resources. Especially the fish where you collect for everything in the water connected to where your meeple is then you place a small token to show that area is exhausted. It is fun but if we could only keep one it would be standard Carcassonne (or at least the Winter Edition we own). </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s Carcassonne only more Winterry. We know. It&#039;s not a real word but that pretty much sums it up. One of the great gateways with better artwork on it. There is just something so simple about the tile placement. By the way we don&#039;t actually play with the meeples as farmers. I know. I know. We can hear the die hard gamers screaming, &quot;Then you aren&#039;t playing it right!&quot; But the one time we tried it just dragged the game out. So we play it to have fun and that&#039;s how we do it. And in the Winter Edition there&#039;s even a Wuzzle. Raise your hand if you get the obscure 80s cartoon/plush toy reference. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The art is beautiful but it is Michael Menzel so there&#039;s no surprise there. The game looks good on the table with lots of resource pieces and cardboard punch outs for each location you build. But for what seems to be a simple worker placement this one does get over wrought in its own mechanisms really quickly. You don&#039;t just build the building you take control of it in some way. It is difficult to explain. Granted the game play isn&#039;t difficult or fiddly to keep up with like in Caylus. But it just bogs down in a few mechanisms that seem to be made complex just to make them complex. And complexity for complexity&#039;s sake is something we hate in games. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Castles of Burgundy is Stefen Feld at his best. He once again takes the randomizing characteristics of 6-sided dice and turns them into something strategic. Each turn those dice rolls give you hard decisions to make. Take a building from the board, place said building or get workers to help you next turn. And while there is the chance you&#039;ll get shut out of what you really want you are never left without an option. It plays very easy. But the game can get a little long especially in the final rounds when your placement is so critical. If you are hesitant about buying your first Feld game we do not think you can go wrong starting with this one. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment> Thanks again to the Dice Tower&#039;s Sam Healey for bringing this one up. The board is beautiful (MIchael Menzel strikes again!) and it is so simple to play. It gives you the Catan feel but removes some of the complexity that kept us away from anything Catan for so long. Down side is that like all standard Catan games it is not set for two-players without having to use some wonky marketplace variant. </comment>				</item>

So ... sadly this one is not for us. Don&#039;t get us wrong. It is a very well-thought out game with cool components, interesting mechanics and not nearly as much of the FEED YOUR PEOPLE from Agricola. But it is just a bit too fiddly. There are so many components to keep up with, honestly too many choices to make and it just felt too long.And for those people who say that you can take many different paths to victory I say &quot;Error!&quot; I stuck with one path while my wife did everything. She CRUSHED me. So there goes that theory. Here&#039;s the weird thing. We did  really have fun while we were playing it. But once we were done,  had wrestled all that cardboard &amp; wood back into the box, we looked at each other and both said , &quot;Trade.&quot; There are people out there who will be able to play this behemoth each and every day and we applaud them. It is a fun game. We liken it to those movies that you enjoy but after you watch it the first time there is no reason to see it again. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This game might just make sure Lords of Waterdeep stays on the shelf or perhaps even traded away. A really thematic working placement game about being a Viking warlord leading your men to victory over trolls, the undead and monsters across the sea. The look of the game in gorgeous and its gameplay is quick and simply but still requires you to put some thought into each placement. You collect your warriors (otherwise known as dice) to take on creatures tormenting towns and villages. And while it does use dice for combat they do not make the game as random as dice in other games. many of the monsters, etc you fight are not terribly tough so they can be defeated with only 1-5 hits. But ti is managing the use of those dice so you don&#039;t lose them all in every battle that sets up the strategy. In addition you have to manage a small number of resources in order to better your odds of defeating your foes. It&#039;s fun, not too long and lends a fair amount of them through the art and game play. The only real downside to this game is that we discovered it after backing Raiders of the North Sea on Kickstarter. Alas Champions of Midgard has a similar theme but is a better game so Raiders will be going on the trade pile still in shrink. </comment>				</item>

It&#039;s taken us a while to actually give this one a try but it&#039;s good so far. Only have played it a few times ( and those with 3 players) I don&#039;t know if it will work well just doing 2 players. Given the role selection mechanism just not sure if it can scale down well. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This reminds us quite a bit of another Kramer and Kiesling game we love; Tikal. Similar but not the same. You assign workers (not really workers in a sense but more like the time each worker uses in the day) to spots to gather coal, distribute that coal, fulfill contracts or just get income. The intriguing part is how you&#039;ll use those &quot;workers.&quot; The 1st person in a spot gets it for 1 worker. The next players can use that space but they must use 1 more worker than the previously player who placed there. If it was 1 you must use 2. If it was 2 you must use 3 and so on. It makes you think ahead for your moves in a very strategic manner. Plus after each shift you score for certain elements of the game. But you must keep those elements in mind for the future because at the end of each shift you score not just for the current elements but for past elements as well. So you have to plan well and use your workers wisely. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Thank you! No roundel. Love this game. One of our favorite Euros. And despite what the rules say you can easily play 2-player on the Empire side of the board without it bogging down the game or making it too easy for anyone. It&#039;s a must have in our opinion. There is one thing about this game that baffles me. And it is in other Euros as well. If scoring only occurs at the end of the game, why is there a scoring track on the board? </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Love the artwork. The simplicity of game play is awesome. And just cut-throat enough for us to like it. But in a 2-player game it becomes wildly unbalanced because of those coterie cards. And this game began to make us understand that area control games just don&#039;t typically support 2 players. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Picked this one up after watching it on Box of Delights. I love the historic nature of the game. You get to learn about the British Civil War as you play the game. But you are just constantly rolling dice. And if you roll badly (like I tend to do) you are not going to do well. There is very little you can do to mitigate the dice so the game just sort of beats you down round after round if you roll poorly (did I mention dice tend to hate me?). But it is an educational game and the graphic design is some of Victory Point Games&#039;s best. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Ok. So maybe this one is our favorite deck builder. IT plays essentially like Ascension but with theme and without the terrible artwork. say what you want about the costumed characters in photo on the cards but that is really awesome, we don&#039;t care what you say! We have been having tons of fun with this game and will continue to do so in the future. As well as looking forward to all the expansions. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Dark Tales is  card game that at first seems rather simple. BUt there is a fair bit of tactics and strategy involved weith how you play the cards and also to where they have to be played. cards played in front of you give bonuses while cards played into a center display offer instant effects as well as the chance to gain benefits in the future. Cards collect into sets that might have future advantages to either or both players as well. each game you play has a card drawn that gives you a way to score points during the game. As well as a card for end game scoring. With these you have some variability from game to game. The art is fantastic and some of the best I&#039;ve seen for such a small game. If you&#039;re looking for theme though you won&#039;t find it here. But what you will find is a game that is fun to play and gorgeous to look at. </comment>				</item>

My hope with seeing this is that Hobby World will continue making more and more expansions.

Plus there is some theme there with the way the tokens interact with certain characters. And you can tell the people who designed this game are fans of not just fairy tales but the original fairy tales since they put in the burning shoes that allow you to score by discarding an Evil Queen. You have to understand the original Grimm fairy tales to get the meaning of some of the content. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is another of those games we hear described as &quot;Arkham Horror Lite.&quot; And it is close with the mechanics, dice rolling and theme. But we think the difficulty and rules set is right up there with AH. The only places it falls into &quot;Light&quot; are the footprint and the components. The board is small and there are only a few decks of cards to draw from. So if you are looking for a game with Arkham Horror&#039;s level of theme and difficulty but don&#039;t want a game that devours two tables if you use more than one expansion this might be the one you&#039;re looking for. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This one is a conundrum. For gaming it is typically only my wife and I. So having any game with a traitor element in it is a bit dodgy. We picked this up after seeing all the hype and after playing a three player game with a friend. We had watched a play through online with someone playing it as purely co-op. However that seems to bring out the worst in the game really. Obviously the traitor elements of the game have to be removed. Then you have to play the game on the hard difficulty in order to make the co-op mode challenging. Problem is that mode might just be too hard. But if you tone it back and don&#039;t play on the hard mode it becomes too easy. It&#039;s hard to tell what will be with Dead of Winter for now. Regardless of whether it not it stays in our collection we are still keeping the &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; and&quot;Felicia Day&quot; promos. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>With most worker placement games you are trying to collect resources in order to accomplish one goal or another that in the end will score you points in order to win the game. Deadwood removes the goal aspect of a worker placement game. In this game you are simply placing workers in order to get money which is points at the end of the game. In short it removes a major aspect of what a worker placement game is. And it doing so it makes the game dull and monotonous.</comment>				</item>

All these things combine to make it a fun game but it just cannot live up to the game it so obviously owes itself to. Plus despite it saying it is a 1-4 player game we dare you to try it 1 or 2 player. It destroyed us mercilessly every time. We now play with 2 characters each making it basically a 4 player only game. Not tried it with 3, might work. That said we are still holding onto our copy. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This game has a good concept. You roll the dice matching symbols to try and break out your outlaw gang before the other player. But there are a couple things working against it. First of all is the dice. You get 4. Each has the symbol of different members of your gang on it to match up. They are cool etched dice but only having 4 of them hampers certain mechanisms in the game. There are certain matching dice rolls of 2-4 symbols that enable you to use either special abilities on outlaws already free or to get a card that gives you a benefit. The problem with these is that with only 4 dice the rolling of them to try and free your outlaws is so tight that should you decide to try and do either of these things you are going to fall behind the other players. This isn&#039;t so much an issue with the outlaws special powers which some only require one matching symbol on the dice but the cards require at least 3. Now if they had put 6 dice in the game it would not make the game so tight and it might make trying to get those cards worth it. But with only 4 ... well, the few times we played we never even tried to get a card for fear of falling behind and losing. These things combined together made Desperadoes a game wherein you MUST play it a certain way or you&#039;ll lose. Now maybe that gets mitigated with more than 2 players but it makes it not a good game for us. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This little game is a bit more interesting than it at first seems. We did manage to get a KS edition in trade so it has some nice extras like play mats for each player. It&#039;s essentially dice placement where over time you can upgrade the dice for higher values. The dice represent beers you are making for sale to the public that will get you points, cash and benefits. You also collect resources to enhance your beers and make them worth more of the aforementioned. The game is nothing innovative or groundbreaking but it is fun and good to look at with steam punk art. Why steam punk in a light Euro about beer making I have no idea. That said, it does have some problems. The resources you get to enhance your brews are tiny circular chits that sit on cards to store them. The cards are not nearly big enough. So every time you pick up one of those resources you are going to knock over the rest. Why they didn&#039;t just make a market board or something like that I don&#039;t get since they had player mats. Plus the iconography is not intuitive. We are constantly having to look back at the rule book to know what they mean. Good game but it sure could use some polish. </comment>				</item>

Plays in less than 30 minutes (at least we know that for a fact with 2 players) but still gives you some strategic choices to make along the way. This is very easily a gateway game that you can teach to someone who knows cards but has never touched a designer board game in their life. </comment>				</item>

He created this epic game that has defined an entire genre of game that will not go away. Thus he will be forever judged by that epic creation. And he will never be able to match it much less surpass it. 
That said we just cannot see keeping it. We have so many other deck builders that are better and with theme , something Dominion is sadly lacking in. So while it is an incredible game it isn&#039;t for us. </comment>				</item>

Our main problem with this is the art throughout the game. The art on the player board and especially the miniatures is AWESOME! Terrific graphic design. But then you get to the other cards and they are designed like some strange twisted My Little Pony art. I will never understand why some companies do this. Just keep your artwork and graphic design consistent. </comment>				</item>

But this is a seriously good game. In the first half you are placing members of your patrician family into locations through out the city. Every now and then this delightful card called an &quot;omen&quot; gets drawn that allows you to throw an opponent&#039;s family member into the volcano. Yes, there is a plastic piece that gets inserted into the board to represent Vesuvius. At a certain point in the game an &quot;AD 79&quot; card will be drawn that halts the first half of the game. From this point on your are attempting to get your people out of the city while drawing lava tiles to place throughout the city (a bit incorrect in the theme since Pompeii was buried in ash by pyroclastic flows but lava tile sounds better than pyroclastic flow tile I suppose) to possibly block exits from the city or to just kill other opponents&#039; family members. A very morbid and macabre theme if you think about it too much but the game abstracts it nicely. The person who has the most family member saved when the lava tiles run out wins the game. 
For some extra added fun look up the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; variant on BGG. If you are a fan of the show you will love this fan-inspired variant. </comment>				</item>

But after a single round of play, round mind you not game, we were bored. In one round you play cards at locations, next round you do ranged attack by drawing cards from a deck (War style) to see who wins and who loses. Then you go through a round of melee combat. You fight at 3 different locations possibly using 8-16 dragons and about 10-14 cards per player. But it just felt like &quot;I play this card. Oh you countered it. Ok Your turn. You play that card. Oh I countered it.&quot; before we had even scored one location we were out of cards. And when that happens subsequent combat is resolved by drawing cards off the deck and comparing them just like War. Like we said perhaps we are just playing this all wrong. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We have been wanting to try Dune  ever since we discovered the board gaming hobby. But either the game is too expensive, too hard to find, in bad shape when it isn&#039;t expensive or a bit too pricey for modern versions. Then there is the concept of will this game play any good with just 2 players since alliances usually play a big part of the board game. But with Express we have found a way to play it that isn&#039;t pricey, hard to find or just as satisfying with 2 players. All the cards are replaced with dice. Yes, it just makes it random but we still get the experience of mining Arrakis and trying to dominate the planet for our House. So maybe rolling dice and playing out actions isn&#039;t as thematic as the alliances, control and traitors that are in the board game, the flavor is still there and it is a fun game that won&#039;t wear out its welcome. </comment>				</item>

Two players is best because then the other person gets to laugh maniacally as they roll 4 dragons for you to fight. Plus this game comes with the best quality dice we have found in any game thus far. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This takes Elder Sign from a fantastic game to one of our top 10 games. Don&#039;t get us wrong we love exploring the museum in Arkham to discover what secrets lie buried there. But going out into Arkham in Gates of Arkham has us wondering if we will ever explore the museum again. Location cards now come out face down when new cards come out. On the back they have abilities that benefit you but usually at the cost of trophies or time. neither if which you really want to use. But if turning the clock forward three times gets you an ally how useful will that be? 
It makes exploring the town a big part of the game. Then there are gates that open into other worlds. And just like in Arkham Horror you have to get these things closed. Ignore them and you WILL pay the price. On top of all that you have event cards that might trigger when you explore a location. Some are good. Most are bad. Beware!
We played this expansion at Dice Tower Con where Richard Launius was demoing it. We honestly had no interest in getting this at first figuring ti was gonna ruin the game. But we had so much fun playing games with Richard at the previous DTC that we tried it anyway. And are we happy we did! he told us expansions would be forthcoming. 
Now if it is just more locations in Arkahm that will be great. But what would be awesome would be Elder Sign : Gates of Innsmouth  or Gates of Dunwich. Here&#039;s to hoping. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a globe spanning adventure with horrific mysteries to solve and sanity-shattering forces to combat. But ...
It just cannot hold a candle to Arkham Horror for us. Despite it being wider in scope it doesn&#039;t feel as immersive. The concept of solving mysteries to accomplish your goals instead of closing gates is novel but in order to make that goal viable the game must have a timer. And the mythos deck serves that purpose. But we just do not like that timer aspect. Plus if the mystery cards get drawn in a certain order you can be stalled out quite quickly. During one game fighting Cthulhu, the epic monster corresponding to a certain mystery card came out and we were never able to defeat it. 
So while Eldritch Horror draws you into a more expansive world the gameplay, unfortunately, contracts the experience in such a way that it feels smaller somehow. </comment>				</item>

Components are awesome but what can you expect from Tasty Minstrel Games. We do wish the technology cards were handled a bit differently. We hate having to keep referring back to the rule to see what we can get as ALL the tech is available from round 1. We think it might work better by categorizing the tech cards into levels that come out for purchases as the game progresses. But other than that this game plays perfect and without Race for the Galaxy&#039;s lexicon of iconography. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment> Now the ship designs have meaning. The scenario cards that determine how each player starts the game is so much better than the standard set up that I cannot really say how much we love it. And some of the new technologies are awesome. That being said we must once again come back the technologies cards and their all inclusive availability. At least with the standard game you could just look at the back of the rule book and try to decide what tech you wanted. But Escalation adds SSSOOOO many more technologies that now you are reading through several pages of the rule book each turn trying to decide what you will buy with your research. It inevitably stops the game dead for minutes while one of use looks through both rulebooks to see what we want. There has to be a better way. Should a game come out with similar game play but no all inclusive tech this and the base game may go on the trade list. Maybe I need to look through the forums and see if anyone has come up with anything. </comment>				</item>

It might be the best tile exploration game out there. You explore the undiscovered seas looking for land to score. You can go cheap and hope for the best flipping tiles that might or might not help you build your route. Or you spend more to start with tiles that you can see how they can be laid out. Along the way you make friends with the natives and try to earn their favor. It plays very easily but it plays a bit long for us. That might be because we are just playing 2 players though we can see some AP and down time issues coming in with 3-4. Regardless it is an awesome game and certainly a keeper. </comment>				</item>

Yes, you look at that board and think &quot;Wow! That looks busy!&quot; But it isn&#039;t. The game play is relatively simple but with enough strategy that you cannot just blunder through it and hope to win. The worker placement is different in that you can bump other people&#039;s workers and take that spot, though in doing so you give them back a worker to place on their turn. Euphoria is filled with other neat mechanisms like the morale &amp; intelligence tracks and being able to gain allegiances with factions on the board . This is a great game and everyone ought to check it out so it can be higher as it deserves. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This one get a 5 simply because of the art. It is fantastic. But the game ... SIGH. 
Despite what it says on the box it does not support two players in our opinion. Drafting games by definition really need at least 3 people. Otherwise they are what Fairy Tale is if you try with just 2 players, BORING. 
And it doesn&#039;t even have any kind of 2-player variant like 7 Wonders or Among the Stars. Nope. You just play it the same with 2 as with 5. Which, did we mention makes it BORING. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A deck building game with some classical artwork on many of the cards and components. It gives the whole game a style that lets you feel like you&#039;re playing inside some childishly strange fantasy world. Which is the point after all. Using the cards you have you move through this world gathering more resources in order to score points to win the game. This game reminds us in some ways of a much much MUCH lighter version of Mage Knight. In fact after playing this game we traded Mage Knight for that reason. Fantasiqa gives you the feel of exploring a fantasy realm but without the novella of rules you need to understand in order to play Mage Knight. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We never though a small card game could get this fiddly. 3-5 players? First time we&#039;ve ever seen a co-op (without a traitor) that needs a minimum of three. Of course the rules say a player can use more than one character but then explains that if you use 2 characters you can only use the special ability of 1 of those players per game. We can see what Toy Vault was trying to do. They were trying to take the &quot;job&quot; action of the Firefly Board Game and turn it into a game unto itself. Unfortunately it doesn&#039;t work. And aside from the pictures it doesn&#039;t represent the Firefly theme at all. This one&#039;s an epic fail. </comment>				</item>

And with each play you will feel like you&#039;re cruising through the &#039;Verse trying to make a living as well as stay alive and free. The only reason this one doesn&#039;t get a 10 is because of the length. Despite the box and adventure cards telling you it will play in 2 hours that will not happen. Set aside 3+ hours for this game.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is the poster child for the cold soulless Euro. Yes there is good art. But nothing really lends to the theme. For starters to gather the resources you need to move forward you basically play a game of YINSH to get them. And you do this every round to gather the resources. Then you do worker placement to build what you need to accomplish quests. And by the way those worker placement choices are always obvious. And should you get shut out of what you really need you&#039;ll fall behind. Then to score points you must advance on quest cards that you buy. I&#039;m sorry .. buying a quest? I get that you are playing the &quot;manager&quot; of the people going on the quest ( a concept that still sounds a bit off let&#039;s be honest) but buying a quest? But back to advancing on the quests. Do you fight the menacing creatures depicted on the quest cards? Nope. You just have to have the resources to advance when that step of the game comes around. Then you do it all over again. And again. And again. AND AGAIN!
This game is so boring. It took forever and that was on the short game. The art is good and the concept is ok ( I won&#039;t say unique because the concept of being the mastermind behind the shadows is already out there in Lords of Waterdeep) but the designer just made this game so complex and overwrought for no good reason. Maybe if the quests were done is a less boring way and you didn&#039;t start every round playing YINSH Forge War could have been something special. But as it stands it&#039;s nothing but rather, rinse, repeat only far more repetitive. </comment>				</item>

And yes, it does have a lot of rules and a lot of dice-rolling. But that is what Ameri-thrash (Thank you Zee Garcia for getting that trend started) games are all about. Plus with Flying Frog you get some of the best components money can buy. And on top of all that you get to play at being Indiana Jones! And who doesn&#039;t want to do that. It is nice to see that FFP has gotten their rules a bit better flushed out with this game than they did with A Touch of Evil. Speaking of which, this game and Dark Gothic have gotten us to give ToE another look and we have fallen in love with that game again. But we&#039;re talking about this game, right? The rounds play quickly once you have a few games under your belt and you understand the rules.  You have this vast world on the game board to explore. It can be one sided in the competitive game if by luck of the draw three treasures appear with 2 spaces of your opponent&#039;s starting location. But the co-op rules are awesome and unlike ToE they don&#039;t seem to have been an after thought add in. Have not tried the team play yet but we can see that as being a bit too much to keep up with. What else can we say?

Each round you get to do one action on the board but you feel like you need to be doing 5 at least. The problem for us was that the theme was too heavy, too immersive. And that is not a fault in the game. The historical accuracy and immersion this brings out is intense. However, when playing Pandemic it is abstracted to the point where when that outbreak happens in Jakarta I don&#039;t feel anything emotionally. In Freedom because the theme of slavery and abolition is so well represented that every time a slave catcher moves or a slave gets put back into the market we feel horrible. The slaves are abstracted by unpainted wooden cubes but that doesn&#039;t seem to help. So while this is an awesome co-op  that deserves all the accolades it has gotten, the theme is ironically too well represented. </comment>				</item>

Were it not for him we wouldn&#039;t have half the games  we do. LOL. But he&#039;s backed a winner with Fresco. There is a lot of set up to it but at least you have something very pretty to look at once you&#039;re done. At its heart Fresco is worker placement and resource management at its simplest. We love the way it all coalesces into painting that beautiful fresco to score the points you need. There are just 2 things keeping this from a 10. 1) All the expansions. You really don&#039;t need them. They truly just add complexity for complexity&#039;s sake. Mind you we are saying this from a non-die-hard Eurogamer POV. So take that for what you will. 2) The Leonardo dummy player that is used in the 2-player game. We have no problem with dummy players in some games (Mage KNight and Pergamon) when they move independently. But a dummy player whose actions are controlled by the players is not a dummy player. No matter what you call it the dummy is a part of your strategy and it can be  a part of that strategy you plan for. Luckily we have devised a way for Leonardo to move on his own. Yes. It is random and involves dice so we can hear the die-hard Euros screaming once more but we prefer it to the designer&#039;s way because it actually makes him a &quot;dummy&quot; player not a part of the players&#039; strategy. </comment>				</item>

You start so weak you can barely do anything but then you start building yourself up little by little. Nothing is easy however and at no point does this feel like something you can breeze through. Alas as a solitaire game it won&#039;t hit the table much but it&#039;s a good way to pass 30 + minutes if you&#039;re itching for a game and no one to game with. </comment>				</item>

We love the idea of building things in a game but most of them are sooooooo complex it gives me an AP headache just watching it being played (Shipyard!). But Gear &amp; Piston plays easily and without too many decisions to be made along the way. Playing those tiles out before me and seeing my car come together is just fun.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This one is a bit of a conundrum. Simple, short and fun. But the components just aren&#039;t quite up to par, even by Victory Point standards. The cards were warped as soon as the box opened and the little dwarf miner standees do not hold together for play. In addition to that there are certain combinations of room cards that would allow a player just to move back and forth between two rooms getting points enabling them to win without having to explore any further. That breaks a game in my opinion but at least it does not come up often. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Glass Road was fun the first time we played it at a demo during DTC 2014. We bought it not long after but found it lacking in one major aspect. We played it with a 5 player compliment but we usually only play bu ourselves (two-player) and it just doesn&#039;t work that well for 2. And it relies a lot on the interaction with the players for the playing of character cards to perform actions. And as stated we typically just have only the 2 of us so that interaction kind of falls away making the game a bit of a slog to play through. Otherwise it is a fine game. The massive number of components that Uwe normally stuffs his game boxes with is replaced by a resource wheel. You manipulate that wheel to get more of one resource which will in turn use up another as you move the dial. It is a really good system for resource management. 
So as stated a very good game with interesting mechanisms but best played with more than 2 players.

It is really fiddly with having to flip tiles as they come out depending on what the game dictates that round. I think maybe we just love the simplicity of Alhambra so much that this game sort of wears on us. But still going to hold onto it if for no other reason that we love using its beautiful board to play Alhambra on.  </comment>				</item>

If there is one drawback it&#039;s that in a 2-player game is definitely loses some of its meaner &quot;take that&quot; moments. Which you might view as a good or bad thing depending on how much you like &quot;take that&quot; games. It works well either way for us. However.... this box! AEG! What were you thinking? As soon as the cards come our of the wrap there&#039;s no way to store the game unless you have deck boxes or bags. Why no insert? </comment>				</item>

Essentially a tile laying / set collection game, the Hanging Gardens plays as easily as any other of that type and looks good on the table doing it. each round you will select cards to place in your tableau to try and make matches of certain types of terrain. But the cards must be laid out in such ways that spaces only overlap if there is a spot on an underlying card. So you have to place the cards very strategically especially since you want the same terrains to be side by side in certain numbers so that you can place temples on them in order to collect point tiles. The more tiles of one type of terrain you can collect the more points you will receive at the end of the game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>maybe it is unfair to rank Hansa at 6. It is a good game with ease of play and some strategy. perhaps if we had found this early in our gaming &quot;career&quot; we might have enjoyed it. But it is so simple that we found it to be boring. It&#039;s a &quot;trading in the Mediterranean&quot; game but it is that genre at its most basic. So compared with games like Concordia it just cannot hold our interest. Plus the components are a joke really. The &quot;player board&quot;  is just a 5 inch card board cut out with a 1 inch diameter icon in the middle that represents where you put your coins. That was a waste of cardboard in all honesty. I don&#039;t need a player board just to stack my money on. So it is a basic Euro and if you are just getting started with gaming in that fashion this might be a good pick. </comment>				</item>

But while Le havre is an engaging game with lots of decisions, Harbour is neither engaging or nor filled with decisions. Like Le havre you get one &quot;worker&quot; to place each round in order to get goods to sell for profit and points. There is a revolving market that over the course of the game makes some goods worth more and some worth less. the market movement is not secret so you can plan for it. However, for the first 3rd of the game the only thing you will be doing is placing your worker on your only player board each turn just to try and build up goods so that you can sell to that market. Plus what you have to do is so obvious each turn given what the market wants that it makes the game play dull. The only really strategic thing you are doing is trying to build up to sell or buy from the market. And that is basically the game. You look at the market, establish what you obviously need to do and do that. </comment>				</item>

With each round you feel as though you are building up your own industry (sometimes standing on your friend&#039;s shoulders to do it). It also plays quick and there is always something you can do. Did you opponent take the franks you wanted to build that Smokehouse? Fine. Just use his slaughterhouse to make some meat and sell that next turn. You&#039;re never blocked out in this game. And if you decide not to pursue some aspect of the industry you aren&#039;t penalized for it. By the time you are finished with this game you really feel like you&#039;ve built something. Unfortunately this game just doesn&#039;t have the re playability we&#039;d hoped. After a few plays it has become the same every time. </comment>				</item>

Draw from the Day deck to increase your hand. If you draw the Vampire Lord and have the right cards in hand, you win. No strategy. No tactics. Just simple luck and fun. Think Talisman crushed down into a card game. </comment>				</item>

Which can be a total Catch 22 because maybe what you like is the complexity. Or maybe you like the game play but complexity of it bogs you down. It&#039;s a toss up really but a simple decision if you like 51st State but find yourself bogging down in its game play pick this game up instead. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Cutthroat Corporate Carcassonne. 
In a way yes.  Infinite City is simply a game of placing tiles in front of you. But those tiles may have special abilities that allow you to manipulate the tiles themselves, your player pawns that you place out on the tiles or other players&#039; pawns. You want to be the first to get all your pawns out because that triggers the end of the game but you also need to be in the lead for pints through out the scoring in the tiles. So it is like Carcassonne in the tile laying but unlike that family friendly game you are constantly doing things to trip up your opponents.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Stefan Feld makes another great game that is apparently being over looked because it isn&#039;t terribly heavy. I mean come on! This game is #597 on the Geek List. It is fantastic. In La Isla instead of using dice to determine any actions you get a hand of cards. Each turn you get to do three different things with those cards. You can use them to get special abilities that make it easier for you accomplish your goals. But don;t get used to those abilities as you can only have a certain number of them and every turn you add a new ability so you are gonna lose one of them sooner or later. You can use the card to get the resources you need to explore the island and observe unique animals. or you can use the cards to make certain animal inherently more valuable point wise by the end of the game. there are strategic and tactical decisions to make each and every turn.  This game needs to be played by more people. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Picked this little gem up on a whim at the friendly local game shop. Looked like it could be fun and was less that $20 bucks. But there is definitely more than $20 worth of game in that little box. A tight , short resource management game with combat. I can hear the Eurogamers now. &quot;Combat in a resource management game! How dare you?!&quot; 
I jest of course. We are coming to enjoy Euros now but that&#039;s beside the point. 
The component quality is ... random I guess is the best word. The cards are medium stock and ought to be sleeved. But there are these awesome metal coins in the box as well as tiny little meeples. Grab it up if you see a copy. It will surprises you. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Carcassonne: The Auction.
Silly I know but if you&#039;ve played this game you might just agree with that assessment. Each round you get a hand of tiles. You must discard one and bid money for the rest. Then you reveal and try to get those tiles that you&#039;ve put money towards. problem is players can always hold money back and buy those tiles out from under you. So you have to think about what tiles you want and try to reason out what tiles your opponents may want. Plan right and you can keep your tile, get one from an opponent and even make money for future rounds. The tile placement is same as you need to get certain tiles at certain because each round there is a scoring phase. And in future rounds you will score the same thing again and again. So it is critical to get what you need to score while either making your opponents pay through the nose for what they need or juts outright deny them that tile by discarding it. So it is a bit like Carcassonne but with an auctioning mechanism that we really enjoy (an exception to rule since we normally hate auction games).

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment> This one clearly ranks as one of our favorite Euros. A worker placement game with simple rules and just enough strategy to keep you thinking from the first move to the last. You move about Istanbul (was Constantinople!) collecting wares and selling them or using them to buy the rubies you need to win the game. Along the way you gamble, have your near do well family go out &amp; do some business for you and even visit a beautiful fountain. The production is top notch and the theme is fairly strong if off-putting to some. We love it a lot. We are really hoping an expansion or two might come out because that will make this already great game a perfect 10 possibly. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We don&#039;t play racing games too often. But the Dice Tower guys talk about this game soooooooo much that we just had to give it a try. And we were not disappointed. Jamaica is a solid game with some of the simplest mechanics put into a game together with some of the best components. You race around the island of Jamaica collecting gold, food and powder in order to outrace and out fight your opponents. Dead simple but so much fun it&#039;s almost criminal. Even the two player variant with the Ghost Ship is easy to play unlike most two player variants that involve dummy players. If only that hadn&#039;t made the rule book like a treasure map! It makes it such a pain to look up any rules. Fortunately they&#039;re aren&#039;t a lot of them. Check it out! It won&#039;t disappoint!</comment>				</item>

And it is very very good. It&#039;s a simple, easy flowing game with a fair amount of strategy that you must employ or you will lose. The art is fantastic on all the cards and it even travels easy. Toss all the components in a zip-loc bag and you&#039;re off. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Jupiter Rescue is another one of those co-op we did not enjoy because it never felt like we ever had a chance of winning the game. The enemies just come out too fast to make any head way. On top of that there are the special power cards that bolster your robot&#039;s abilities. While they are neat in theory, the game let&#039;s you combine some of those card abilities together but does not explain how some of them work in tandem so you are left to figure them out by yourself. There are not a ton of these special abilities so all it would have taken would have been one more page detailing how those abilities combine. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We have only just gotten into playing pure abstract games but this is sure to be a favorite. Looking like a cross between chess and checkers it is neither (fortunately). Each player moves a piece as far forward as he likes either orthagonally or diagonally. Whatever color he lands on decides what piece the other player may move. But all you or your opponent has to do to win is get one piece to the opposite side. So each movement is critical. And in the end, guess what? You are the one who gives your opponent the move to beat you. &quot;YOU beat you!&quot; as the Dice Tower&#039;s Zee Garcia put it.</comment>				</item>

Tt even has a pretty cool mechanism that allows you to play cards in combination if you&#039;ve played the right types of symbols. But it doesn&#039;t bring enough to keep us interested and plus it doesn&#039;t look Japanime games is supporting it all with more content.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>There are not a lot of auction/bidding games that we can get behind just because we loath those mechanics. But here is one we like. This one we tried out as a lark at a demo during the Dice Tower convention. But boy are we glad we did. The similarities between this game and Peleponnes is what drew us in though there are numerous differences. You bid on location tiles to add to your tableau just like Peleponnes but instead of just getting resources , you get to activate abilities on those tiles that benefit you. The art is stylish with iconography that is easy to understand. Not sure if any of the other Key-universe games are for us but this one certainly is. </comment>				</item>

Or maybe hang about the outskirts to collect points? Or are you gonna tear your way into Tokyo and demolish everything and everyone? Chances are good you can win using one or all of these methods. Plus you do it all by chucking dice! LOVE IT!Now if it just played better with 2 players. If you just play it with 2 it becomes and back and forth game of &quot;Tokyo is mine! No!

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This one is a misfit. Any time we can get a game that&#039;s full of dice we typically do so even if we know nothing about it. That&#039;s the case with King&#039;s Forge. The components are very good , including a 1st player token that must cost $5 to manufacture. Seriously! Don&#039;t believe us, look up the game. It&#039;s a plastic anvil that&#039;s bigger than most tactical mins in WH40K or the like.  It&#039;s a good theme. But the game is very wonky. There are different factions but no special abilities. Plus the rules are not very well written. Every time we have played it we&#039;ve had to go to a video tutorial in order to refresh our memories because the rule book is pretty useless. Not so sure this one will hang around much longer. Definitely play it first before buying. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Many people have given Kingdom Builder a bad rep. But we just don&#039;t see why. Yes it lacks the innovation and strategy of Dominion. But it is still fun for what it is. And that is an abstract strategy game with beautiful art and fairly simple mechanisms. You draw a card and then using the terrain on that card play your houses onto the modular board to the best of your ability. Vaccarino has made a game that you can teach in about 5 minutes (that&#039;s how long it took a couple to teach us to play it at Dice Tower Con 2014) but enjoy playing for a very long time. </comment>				</item>

The leader cards add something to game that was missing before. But the event cards are so not needed that we put them out during set up of our last game and actually totally forgot about them. And the combat chits replace the dice which we think is sacrilege. LOL. But it does make an awesome game even better. If you have Kingsburg then you need &quot;To Forge a Realm&quot; as well. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>At first glance this games seems quite simple. You are moving your pawns across tiles trying to collect seeds in order to collect points at the end of the game. Also you draw tiles from a bag in order to expand and explore (the bag that comes with this game for drawing the tiles is a joke. If the tiles were Carcassonne size it might work but since the tiles are the size of Keyflower tiles &amp; twice as thick it makes it impossible to shuffles the tiles about in the bag once you put them in)thus giving you and your opponents access to other abilities. However this isn&#039;t as easy as it seems. Pawns (called acolytes and Eldrids) can activate other tiles through other pawns as well as having abilities triggered during certain phases of the age,. In the end you are trying to unravel (remove) tiles from play in order to score them at the end of the game. But you score depending on how many of any one type of tile is the most numerous after it&#039;s all over. So you have to plan very very VERY carefully. This one brought out our AP more so that even Trajan (and that&#039;s saying something). So for real gamers the theme and components may be off putting but this is a very strategic game. </comment>				</item>

That happened after we got Lap Dance. The theme is pasted on. The art is terrible. The game play is plodding and even has a times phase with a sand timer. Any time you see a sand timer in a game just walk away. I cannot in good conscience explain why I got this game except that somewhere in the back of my mind the 13 year old boy in the back of my mind giggled and pressed the &quot;buy&quot; button. 
Please don&#039;t make the same mistake I did. Ignore the stupid adolescent voice and just get a good game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A simple and easy dice game. You roll dice to try and gain control in a casino to win the money there. Roll your dice ... allocate as many dice of the same number to a casino ... next player ... at the end of a round if you have the most dice at the casino you get the money ... most money wins. Simple but fiendishly fun. Thank you Chaz Marler of Pair of Dice : Paradise. I don&#039;t think we would have given this one a second thought if you hadn&#039;t talked about in on Board Game Breakfast. </comment>				</item>

Make friends, marry off children, invest in the local economy or buy yourself a mansion. Legacy plays smooth and easy even for a work placement game. The theme is what really draws you in and there is more than enough strategy for hard core gamers to latch onto. Be warned however, this thing&#039;s footprint on your table will spread larger and larger (especially with 3-4 players) so be prepared for it. </comment>				</item>

While it plays similar to Marvel you get a very different feel and the theme is far more immersive. It plays in about the same amount of time but due to the graphic nature of the artwork we wouldn&#039;t advise playing this with anyone under 13. 
 Really looking forward to expansions for this. Predators? Prometheus? Sure hope so!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We like Marvel comics and we like deck builders. So this one was a no brainer to get. But the theme just isn&#039;t as strong in this one as say Sentinels of the Multiverse though it is actually a better game. But there has been an upswing in the play with this one. Liking it much more with expansions. The only real problem is that it is hard to set this game up randomly like you can with most deck builders because doing it that way you end up with Masterminds involved in schemes that make no sense. Can you see Galactus trying to take over the Daily Bugle?</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The powers of the characters in this game are some of the best in Legendary. But the reason it came and went like a thief in the night for use was because of the semi-coop nature. True that in standard Legendary there is technically a winner with whomever has the most points in their victory pile but we never bother with that. Did we defeat the mastermind? Yes. Then we won! But Legendary:Villains pushes this coop game into such a semi-coop with cards that allow you to attack other players, give them bindings and basically try and take it all for yourself. Granted you can try to play it as a full coop but so many of those card abilities are geared towards hammering your opponents. Good idea ( I was really looking forward to playing Magneto finally) but a fail for us. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Livingstone is a very well produced game with great art by Michael Menzel and gem pieces that are not your standard fish bowl decorations. It is a simple race game but that is one of its flaws. 1) It really is just a simple race in whcih you play cards to advance a ship along the board. 2) Why it is called Livingstone we have no idea. David Livingstone was a Scottish missionary but nothing about him comes across in the game thematically unless you count his image on the box cover. 3) There is a mechanism in this game that involves putting gold that you&#039;ve collected into a chest during the game. If at the end of the game you have the least gold in your chest you lose regardless. We are not sure what this mechanism has to do with the theme but as the theme is just pasted on anyway it doesn&#039;t matter that much in the long run. However in a 2-player game that mechanism becomes pointless as it can be easily kept up with throughout the game. So it looks good but ... eh.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Now this game has something to do with Lord of the Rings as you work your way through the world and story of Tolkein&#039;s Middle Earth. Spectacular art and intense gameplay make it the best of FF&#039;s LCGs and probably one of the better card games in the business. The only thing that keeps it at a 7 is there is too much power creep the further along in the adventures you go. And with that happening the deck you had for that adventure isn&#039;t going to work in this adventure. So with each new play we have to remake our decks to have a better chance. Yes. Yes. We know that for some people that retooling of your decks as the story gets more difficult is the best part. But for us it becomes a bit of a chore. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment> This is one of our favorite worker placement games. With its easy game play and top rate quality components it should be near the top of everyone&#039;s list. But we will say one thing about it. Let&#039;s be honest. The D &amp; D theme is pasted on. Don&#039;t get us wrong it is still an awesome game despite that. But we have to disagree with certain people (Richard Ham. we&#039;re talking to you) who believe this game can get RPGers into board games. We have been part of die hard RPG groups in the past and there is no way they&#039;d consider this D &amp; D. Reasonably certain they would all just look at us in a very cross manner were we to even suggest such a thing. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Oh yes! This expansion is one of the best. The new locations, lords and intrigue add so much to the game. And the corruption brings out the theme quite well. The new cards and locations all make sense. And did I mention the corruption? This makes the game feel thematic now. Plus now you have new ways to win without just grabbing up quests. New lord cards give you alternate paths to victory. And if you play your cards and meeples right you can pull out an unexpected victory. I started out last in points in my last game but won because the other 2 took so much corruption they lost mondo points while I had gotten rid  of all my corruption. If Lords of Waterdeep is a game you own you have to get Scoundrels of Skullport. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>it took us a long time to give this game a try mainly because it has Knizia&#039;s name on it and we not liked any of his games so far. But when you hear Tom Vasel talk about a game enough you just have to break down and give it a try. And you know what? It is a very good hand management, set collection game with some really tight strategy. The only thing we don&#039;t like about it is that wonky scoring. Add up the numbers on the cards, multiply it by the number of this type of card  then subtract 20? It doesn&#039;t seem to complicated but we are always having to refer back to the rules and a calculator to see who won. Why does he always have to make scoring in his games so complicated? </comment>				</item>

It uses the same basic mechanic : draw a card, play a card. But the way those cards play and the way the end game plays out makes it so much more than just another version of Love Letter. We did fear it might just be a re-theming but its not. Lost legacy is game all its own and worth checking out. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This edition of Lost Legacy comes down a bit because one of these versions ( The Whitegold Spire) includes scoring points for certain cards and winning that way instead of finding the Lost Legacy. We can understand the designer wanting to step up the game play but we prefer the simplicity of just finding the Legacy. </comment>				</item>

You&#039;re kidding right? Wrong. This game is fun, engaging, fun and wait...did we say fun twice? Oh well. But it is. We don&#039;t think you can go wrong with this game whether you get the Tempest version or one of the other  editions that are available from AEG. It will be the best $8-10 you have ever spent. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>FINALLY! We had seen this game played by so many reviewers online but it took so long to get we though it might just be a huge internet/gaming hoax. But it&#039;s real!
And a very good game to boot. It incorporates many mechanic and styles of play into a small box. It feels like a civilization building game,. plays like a deck builder and works like set collection. A lot of game in a small package. The art is whimsical and the game play is easy to follow. It took a while to get it, but it ain&#039;t going nowhere. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>If ratings went above 10 this would get an 11. It makes Machi Koro sooooo much better. Yes. There are new cards but that isn&#039;t half of it. The new set up is the best way to play. NO longer do all locations go out. Instead you draw to start until you have at least 10 locations. Some might have just 1 card and you will really want it. And as locations are removed you draw back up to 10 locations. So new locations and opportunities are always coming up. If you have the base game you MUST get the Harbor. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Art is cool. The theme looks good. But once you open the rule book it all seems a bit too fiddly. Backed this game on Kickstarter some time back because I didn&#039;t see too many other Cthulhu based games besides Fantasy Flight&#039;s that we liked. Unfortunately for this game Eldritch Horror came out first and that game does everything I thought Machina Arcana would do and does it better. So this one gets a pass mostly on bad timing. </comment>				</item>

But there&#039;s something about the game play that has us scratching our head. At its heart madame Ching is a card driven race game with a set collection aspect that makes for an okay game. But not a great one. We wish there was something more to this. But it just doesn&#039;t match up to Jamaica which is the best racing game out there. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>You are going to be frustrated. Because this game is hard and complex. Mind you it is still fun. The components are awesome with beautiful artwork on the tiles and well painted minis to boot. But there are just sooooooo many mechanisms you are trying to keep track of. A very slow deck building aspect combined with dice rolling, hand management and host of others. There is even a dummy player for 2-player game (though it isn&#039;t as bad in this game and just acts as a timer) There is an exploration aspect to this game that we love as we uncover new locations and enemies. That part we love. But that brings us to the part we loathe. The combat in this game is just too fiddly to keep up with. The rule book even advises you that you should ask other players for help in combat. So Vlaada has made an awesome gamers version of a fantasy adventure game. But maybe we just aren&#039;t gamers enough for it.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment> Set up it is beautiful to behold.  But we just didn&#039;t like the see-saw game play. Draw a tile , score gold (otherwise known as points. Why they cal it gold we have no idea. There are no coins. There aren&#039;t even score chits. Just a scoring track that , by the way, doesn&#039;t show coins or gold either), use gold to play another tile is you scored any gold (otherwise known as points), place a worker, score gold (otherwise known as points), use gold (otherwise known as gold {have I mentioned this before? can you guess that I found it dumb?}) to place more worker to score gold (otherwise known as ... oh you get the idea), then move one to the next player who repeats said process. There&#039;s a spinner in the middle fo the board that points to the current player which is a good mechanic but since all the tiles have arrows that show the direction they must be facing to be played and that arrow shifts with the spinner it is just a gimmick. This game is just lather, rinse, repeat and it doesn&#039;t do that well. We can clearly see why it came free with the Thebes KS from Queen Games. It just isn&#039;t good. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Mangrovia is a medium weight Euro combining area control with a little worker placement. You are essentially trying to score points my having the majority of your tribe&#039;s huts placed in certain areas of the board. You do that using a rondel-type worker placement. As the actions on that &quot;rondel&quot; go around every turn you get one action from one side and another action from the other aside. These actions enable you to build huts, draw cards that are needed to build the huts or rearrange the plots of land in which the huts can be built. There is a grid on the main board where you will score points for having the majority on the X axis and the Y axis. This was purchased at a friendly local gaming store by my wife while she was working out of town. She wanted a different type of Euro and this was suggested. And it was certainly a good suggestion. Not sure if it is getting a big print run anywhere but it you see a copy, give it a try. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The games play is immersive and the mechanics are pretty easy. Two huge problems though. Dungeons crawls such as this require more than just two people to make the experience worthwhile and 90% of the time it is just the two of us. Second are those puzzles. I tell you there is nothing more exciting than exploring a dank cellar complete with an alter and then having to stop the game for 5 minutes while one of our party tries to figure out how to rewire a circuit box. This just takes you totally out of the game. We thought so from the beginning and we&#039;re happy to find that one of our favorite game designers thought the same. A good game for some just not for us.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>From Uwe Rosenburg comes a game with minimal components? Wow! Really? Ok. Granted there are a lot of cubes in this game. But the footprint of this game doesn&#039;t take up a whole table. The round goes by quick and players don&#039;t sit staring at the board for 10 minutes trying to analyze their next three moves. The time mechanism helps out the players as well as being the game timer. You aren&#039;t punished for not doing something and the paths to victory are varied. Merkator is overlooked compared to Agricola and others and we cannot understand why. It&#039;s a strong, solid Eurogame. Try it if you haven&#039;t. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Bit of a mess this one. Mechanically and aesthetically. It seems to a Tsuro type of game. You are building circuitous routes on a board using tiles not dissimilar to Tsuro. But whereas Tsuro has larger tiles with routes that are easy to discern, Metro has much smaller tiles with even more twists on them that makes trying to devise any sort of plan vastly too complicated we think. Sure you can play it loose and just lay down tiles without thinking too far ahead but you aren&#039;t going to make any useful routes that way. So in order to make any real progress you have to AP yourself into a stupor trying to sort out where to put each and every tile. Not to mention that when you place a tile you might be helping not just yourself but your opponents. This one is just to AP inducing for us. </comment>				</item>

The miniatures in this game were so cool it inspired my wife to take up the hobby of painting minis. Some of the rules can become a bit fiddly and bog down the game play but those incidents are few and far between. The biggest problem we have with it is that &quot;cheese wheel.&quot; It can fill up so fast thanks to enemies rolling cheese that we&#039;ve had to house rule that after each board (both sides) are completed we clear the cheese wheel otherwise we never finish. I&#039;m sure some of you will cry foul but this is the only game we own where we are enjoying playing through the story more than the actual game play. </comment>				</item>

And the theme is ok. But we love playing this as much as any strategic two-players game like say 51st State. It must be that it somehow manages to be greater than the sum of its parts. </comment>				</item>

Temporum is also a very well designed game with easy game play and good art. So anytime people say that one of his games is bad we tend to scoff. So since everyone said Nefarious was awful we decdided to give this a try especially with a new edition. But in this case everyone is right. This game is awful. It is just what Tom Vasel proclaimed it to. &quot;An economic boring snooze fest.&quot; The game play is so simple as to be downright childish. You just do one thing this turn, then pretty much the same thing next turn. Cobble that together with this edition&#039;s terrible components (player board that are printed on thin card stock and cards that were so thin I had to actually be constantly mindful of how I was handling them because the slightest crease would bend the bloody things) and this is a really bad game. </comment>				</item>

But each tile will activate in a certain order so you have to plan very strategically. So it is a good game but we really were not into it. Maybe it was it being so abstract but not being a pure abstract. </comment>				</item>

You place tiles to gather resources then use those resources to place other tiles in order to make sets to get points. A cool mechanism is that after you&#039;ve used all the resources the other players in order get to use what is left over. But the component quality is a bit off, whoever designed the tiles placed in the resource grid apparently neglected to make sure everything was cut right so the more the board fills up the more the tiles are pushed out of line. And the scoring is soooo fiddly. So good but probably could have been better. </comment>				</item>

The theme is really cool. You play a child&#039;s stuffed animals that defend his dreams from nightmares. But the game itself has a lot of problems. First of all the rule book is poorly written. And by rule book I mean a double-sided sheet of paper with rules printed on it. Second, are the stuffed animal characters you fight with. many of them are not very strong except by earning stars that you get in between rounds that allow you to activate toys (weapons) and abilities. The nightmares you fight are not easy ( and while we enjoy a tough co-op, this seems a bit much) so even getting to that is difficult. Except for a stuffed bear that comes with toys(weapons) and abilities already activated. So you pretty much have to use him. Then there is healing. Which is nearly impossible except through the use of another stuffed animal. So you pretty much have to play him. So unless you use these two characters you are pretty much guaranteed to lose. We really wanted to like this game because the theme was so unique. But the game itself ruined that. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is the game that started it for us. Well, in reality, it was the first episode of TableTop we ever watched. We started watching TableTop when a link to it showed up after a webisode of Felicia Day&#039;s FLOG. And we&#039;ve been board gamers ever since.  WHEAAAAAAATOOOOOOON! (Any Big Bang Theory fans out there?)
Anyway ... this has to be one of our top 5 games. A thinky adventuresome puzzle that has you sweating from start to finish. You never know what will happen next. Never assume you&#039;ve won until that last disease is cured! Just when you least expect it Pandemic can leave you a quivering bloody mess (figuratively speaking) on the lab floor. Wash your hands and expect the unexpected.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>All the tense game play and co-operative interaction of the regular Pandemic board game are here. But with dice!!Yes this game comes with a huge amount of dice. Dice that are guaranteed to have you screaming &quot;No! Not in Europe! That&#039;s an outbreak!&quot; And instead of simply using actions set forth by the rule book you get actions decided by the dice you roll. Fortunately you can re-roll the dice, Yahtzee style, to try and get what you need to save the world. Unfortunately you cannot re-roll those dice when the bio-hazard symbol comes up. That too will have you screaming &quot;Come on!&quot; Don&#039;t believe me? watch Rahdo Run Through this one. You will laugh yourself silly at his misfortune. We think the only negative point of The Cure is that the game doesn&#039;t let up. In Pandemic you get lulls in the horrific pestilences. Not so in this one. But regardless it is still fun and we think that if you like Pandemic you&#039;ll like Pandemic The Cure. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A role-playing game cunningly disguising itself as a card game. We play our copy at home and play another campaign with our gaming group. We cannot get enough of this game. And while it doesn&#039;t make us want to play the actual RPG (too many rules) it has gotten us into reading the novels. Cannot wait for the rest of Rise of the Rune Lords then after that is Skulls and Shackles. This is the top notch of games in the business. If you haven&#039;t gotten it then you need to. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Seems almost hard to believe that this came from the designer of Alien Frontiers. Alien Frontiers has simple worker placement and resource management mechanics with a tiny bit of in your face &quot;take that.&quot; Pay Dirt however has a somewhat confusing and very limited auction system wherein one person bids on one item in either equipment, personnel or claims. Other players then must bid on that item or pass. So that means if someone bids on say an excavator they want that means you cannot bid on the wash plant you want. or maybe we are totally wrong about that and if that&#039;s the case then the rules for the bidding are not very well written. Then there are the hardship cards that just seem to be a massive &quot;take that&quot; element every round of the game. Granted this is a totally different game than Alien Frontiers so you cannot really compare the two. But it just isn&#039;t for us for the reasons stated above. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We would never have tried this had a friend not talked us into it one night. Thanks Bill. We steered clear of this because we do not like auction games. But this auction game does something most other auction games doesn&#039;t. It plays out like a real auction. If you bid for something but get outbid you don&#039;t lose what you bid originally. You get it back. How about that? A realistic auction. There&#039;s that and it is also a quick civilization building game that requires some planning and forethought but not so much that it induces mind numbing analysis paralysis. The art on the cards is stylistic and evocative. It&#039;s easy to play and it makes you think in a fun way.It&#039;s only detriment is that as a two-player game it scales down too much. I&#039;m not sure if that makes sense. With 3 it was great. At 4 it was awesome. But at 2 it was just ok.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Rahdo does it again. After watching Richard Ham&#039;s play through of this game we have spent the better part of a year trying to get our hands on it. Finally got it in trade and it was way worth it. Basically a set collection, bidding game. Now normally we don&#039;t like bidding games but this one is simple since you just place a marker along a row to try and see how much $$$ you can get to dig up relics from the excavation site. In a two-player game a dummy player vies for $$$ and relics as well but this dummy player system isn&#039;t as clunky as the &quot;Free City&quot; in 7 Wonders. Liking it a lot!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The smallest tightest pick up and deliver game. This games flies so far under the radar that the only reason we had heard of it was through Eric Summerer&#039;s Top 100 games of all time on the Dice Tower Network. It&#039;s a Kosmos 2-player game with such easy play you can be playing it straight out of the box in 5 minutes. We got this in a trade with several other games and weren&#039;t holding out much hope really but since Eric gave it such high marks we thought there was nothing to lose. But we won with this little game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>&quot;The patriarch of worker placement games&quot; as Sam Healey put it. And he&#039;s right. Pillars of the Earth is easily one of the best produced and best designed Euro games you will find. Plus it has the innovation of drawing workers randomly from a bag to see when or if you&#039;ll place your worker first or later. Wanna place your worker first? It&#039;ll cost you. The sooner you place the more you pay but you get access to what you need sooner. Place later and it won&#039;t cost nearly as much but you may get shut out of what you want and have to settle for the left overs. The decision is yours. And as the game goes along you get characters with special abilities to help you out in future rounds. But only if you can get them soon enough. Thus paying more. Pillars plays smooth and clean without any hard to follow rules or fiddly mechanisms. This one is a must own. </comment>				</item>

The price really is a bit much. But if you&#039;re feel like spending $60-70 on a dexterity game this is the one to get. Wait. Are there any other dexterity games that cost $60-70? </comment>				</item>

Now the theme isn&#039;t strong in this one but it still pulls you in with the artwork and the mechanics. It feels like a micro-civ game. You build up your part of the city for bonuses and benefits. Rome grows before you adding more and more options. The worker placement system is unique in that you use dice as the workers. Yes. Yes. Dice as workers! That isn&#039;t unique! Ah ... but this is the only dice placement game where your workers level up as they work. And when they reach 6 pips they retire. The &quot;pay your people&quot; aspect of the game is a bit annoying ( too much like &quot;feed your people&quot;) and some of the tiles are too overpowering but you can easily mitigate that simply by removing said tiles from the game ( I think there are 2. A temple and some market). It&#039;s a unique game and well worth the investment. </comment>				</item>

Then have I got a game for you. Progress is just that. You are building a tech tree. And nothing else. You place cards into your tableau either group use of some type of knowledge you&#039;ve acquired or by have tech already constructed that meets that card&#039;s criteria. And that&#039;s really all there is to it. But it is awesome in the respect. We ended getting this game because an oversight in shipping with a previous game earned up us either a refund of the previous game&#039;s cost or this game at no charge. Just for giggles we took this. And ti was a good choice. You&#039;ll have to pay $$$ for your copy of course. But it will be $$$$ well spent. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We often think so many people think that in order for a board game to be good it has to be deep and complex. Quantum is neither of those things and it is quick to become one of our favorites. Love the dice as ships. Mind you any game with dice is a plus for us. Easy game play and variable difficulty. If you want a fun game then Quantum is where it&#039;s at. </comment>				</item>

There are a lot of them in this box. And it is always so much fun to roll them. Collecting monsters and fighting it out. We just wish this game had a bit more theme in it. We cannot quite put our fingers on what would help that out but we wish we could. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We were dubious about this one until we watched Rahdo run through it. Then we were hooked. It gives you a sci-fi theme in a brilliantly designed card/hand management game. So interesting to sit there and try to figure out the best way to play your own cards and how to play off your opponents. There is one major problem though and no doubt you can guess what that is if you&#039;ve played the game. That iconography is physically painful at times trying to figure out what you should be doing. I understand trying to make a game language independent but this one falls way short of success. And with games like Eminent Domain and Star Realms this one is taking a huge dive. </comment>				</item>

Red Dragon Inn is another of those games that is just too fun not to be played. Granted it&#039;s mostly just luck of the draw but in the end it&#039;s still fun! And you cannot go wrong with that. Besides in what other game can you share a drink with a priestess and a wizard while living in fear of what the killer bunny is going to do?

It&#039;s still a good worker placement style game that draws you into this world of survival, despair and courage. And there is so much replayability. Chances are you&#039;re never going to play the game the same way twice. All those event cards to play. Six different adventures from Robinson Crusoe to Indiana Jones to Swiss Family Robinson to cannibal attacks. There are times when it does seem too punishing but that is the challenge don&#039;t you know. </comment>				</item>

This is another one that Richard Ham suckered us into getting (thanks Rahdo)but we have enjoyed it. Don&#039;t let the theme put you off. It is a good Euro with area majority, card drafting (buying actually) and resource management. Complex and challenging it can fill a couple hours with a fun game that will surprise you. </comment>				</item>

But seriously ... we saw this game on Kickstarter and groaned. Another zombie game? But what we failed to notice was the designer&#039;s name. Richard Launius ; the designer of our favorite game Arkham Horror. So when we got to Dice Tower Con 2014 and saw that the man himself was running a demo we gave it a shot. And brother is it FUN! This one could be the king of push your luck games. Fight off the zombies as they come in wave after wave after after wave after wave. Plus you run, fight or die depending on the roll of dice. Always a plus as well. Needless to say when we got back to our hotel room that night we ordered a copy online. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Seasons is a good game. It gets the rating it does simply because the theme just isn&#039;t there. You are wizards trying to summon magic, creatures, etc and prove that you are the best. But I never feel like I am a wizard. I feel like I am rolling dice and using the faces of those dice for actions in the game. That aside it plays good  2-3 (have not tried 4 yet) without much downtime. each round you will get to do something. And while you may not get to do what you really want you aren&#039;t shut out of actions. Plus it has delightfully whimsical fantasy art and some of the biggest dice I have ever seen in a game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The Secret of Monte Cristo is a good game but it has a flaw in its system when it comes to two-player games. The main mechanic of this game is an action slide on which marbles are placed that determine the order in which players take certain actions. There are four actions that are done each turn (getting supply boats, placing workers in the Chateau D&#039;if, allocating treasure into the Chateau and rearranging the order of either the marbles in the action slide or the gems in the market for scoring) and who gets to perform those actions is determined by whose color marble its at the bottom of that particular slide. It seems straight forward but the rearrange action you can take in the 4th action slide can make the game incredibly swingy. In a 2 player game each player receives 6 marbles as opposed to 4 marbles in a 3-4 player game. In our recent game due to all those marbles being present I managed to rearrange the action slide so that I did all the actions that turn thus blocking my wife from getting a single action. Subsequent to that it meant she could not get a rearrange action until the following turn. That allowed me to also get the first three actions on the next turn again. Yep, if you&#039;re doing the math that meant I got 7 straight actions after rearranging. This allowed me to get so many supply boats, workers in the chateau and treasures placed that I won after only 2 scoring rounds and I won by 33 points! Now in a 3-4 players game due to each player only having 4 marbles it will be very difficult to pull off what I did thus making the game not so swingy. But as we play our games 90% of the time 2-player that means this game doesn&#039;t work for us. We like games where it is balanced enough that one of us cannot CRUSH  the other. And Secret of Monte Cristo doesn&#039;t provide that. </comment>				</item>

But after watching Rahdo&#039;s Run Through we just had to try it. The board is 2-sided allowing you to play an easy version where you see what kinds of crops will be available to help you score. Or there&#039;s the other side where the crops are hidden so you aren&#039;t quite sure what you&#039;ll end up with. Then you have several different modules you can add to up the complexity. Those things combined give it great replayabilty. The graphic design is very well done and once you&#039;ve finished a game you can see what you&#039;ve made and feel a little proud.It makes you think without inducing AP for extended periods. This may be one of the best and most underrated Eurogames in the world.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment> It plays well and is not terribly complex in any way. The rounds go by quickly. Though there is a lot of bookkeeping maintaining how many HPs everyone has and what modifiers are attached to whom. But it is full of theme and each character has his/her own story that you can meld into the game play as you like. Repeated plays of this have started to pull it down for us. Unless you play some of the easier villains it can become devastatingly hard. We might have thought before that this game was better than Marvel:Legendary but more plays of both games is changing our mind. While the theme is certainly stronger it may just be a bit too much even for a cooperative game. </comment>				</item>

Each turn you &quot;advance evil&quot; before taking your turn. And there really isn&#039;t any action you can take there that isn&#039;t going to make you look the traitor. And probably the most brilliant and devious aspect is that there might not even be  traitor. 
Sadly we rarely get a chance to play with more than just the 2 of us or maybe 1 or 2 more. So it&#039;s a game that won&#039;t see much play time so it&#039;s hitting the trade list. But if you get together regularly with 4+ people don&#039;t miss this classic in the genre. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Another good solitaire game. And by that we mean you can play it by yourself and that it is literally the game Solitaire with the theme of Titanic on it. It plays just like you&#039;d expect it to with a few character powers and a game board that it replaced with a spiral bound book that shows the iconic ship slipping beneath the water. </comment>				</item>

You collect resources via some poker-style chips and use them to purchase cards from a central display. Those cards add to a permanent set of resources you control that aid in purchasing more expensive cards from the central display again. It is simple but brings out a complex game that moves along at a steady pace and never wears out its welcome. This game should win the Spiel award it has been nominated for. We don&#039;t think there is another game out there that plays as smooth and as seamlessly as this one but still brings out so much fun. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Probably the most Euro complexity you can get for your money. Small box. Big game. Worker placement mixed with area majority to give you (possibly) access to locations or special abilities. What&#039;s neat is that you place the worker between locations giving you a chance to get something even if what you really wanted gets taken by someone else. So you have quite a bit to think about in that regard. It can be prone to pull AP players into a fugue from time to time however so be wary of that. And except for that is runs like clockwork. A deep complex game in a small package. I do agree with Richard Ham though. Why did they even bother with the &quot;Spyrium&quot; concept. Making this game some weird steam-punk world doesn&#039;t really brings anything to it. They could just has easily have mad it about coal mining and it would have been just as good. Maybe Attia didn&#039;t want to try and compete with &quot;Coal Baron.&quot; </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Yes. Yes. We know. Another deck builder? And a sci-fi themed one at that? Indeed. This one gets high marks for being a simplistic game of attack and recruit. &quot;Core Worlds for Dummies&quot; if you will. We tried Core Worlds before and were totally gob-smacked with how mathy (nope not a word either but you get the idea) it is. The game should come with a calculator. But Star Realms takes the concept of building up forces in your armada/system to attack your adversary and makes it so simple it&#039;s almost obscene. LOL. That simplicity and ease of play is what puts it on the same level with Eminent Domain. We don&#039;t think you can go wrong with this one. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Here we go again. Another foray into FF&#039;s LCG. Call of Cthulhu was a flop. Lord of the Rings wore out its welcome. And you couldn&#039;t pay us to try Android : Netrunner. But this has two things going for it. Ease of play and theme. Thank goodness FF hasn&#039;t used anything from the prequels yet. Oh please don&#039;t do it FantasyFlight! The ease of play comes from how you build the decks. You don&#039;t sort through individual cards to make a deck and either A)hope you get the right combos to do well or B) spend days perfecting your deck to destroy everyone. You pick objectives to be used in play and taking the 5 cards corresponding to them. WE LOVE THIS! That individual card selection was what drove us nuts when we used to play YuGiOh! and it&#039;s what killed Lord of the Rings. So this set up is so much better. It&#039;s only at a 7 because we haven&#039;t played it enough. But there is the one problem with it. The committing characters to the Force to tip the Balance of the Force. Ok. We can see the mechanism for it is and respect the strategy it adds to the game. But we so wish it wasn&#039;t in there. It just makes the game fiddly in that regard. Alas there seems to be no way to play without it. But we will continue to enjoy it even with that aspect. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>One of our favorite worker placement game. Thank you Sam Healey from the Dice Tower for talking so much about this one. Love the theme and the artwork (my dream game room will have Michael Menzel game boards framed and mounted on the walls [I might have mentioned that before] )but most of all the game play. The resource gathering using the dice can be a bit random but it&#039;s easy to offset. The one thing we don&#039;t like about it is how the scores can go into the 100s. It&#039;s  just silly really. Why do the scores need to go that high? Our last game ended with a score of 265 to 242. That&#039;s insane. But it is the only dent in this otherwise flawless game. </comment>				</item>

Their system of buying those packs and bolstering your own forces is very good. But there is something about this game that niggles us. The most annoying thing is that we can&#039;t put my finger on what. It is enjoyable to play but every time we look at it on our shelf we think , &quot;Nah. Rather play something else.&quot;</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Takenoko is a tile laying game where you move about a hungry panda and a frustrated gardener to try and score points through different means. It&#039;s enjoyable and gives you several different ways to win either by precisely laying tiles, growing certain heights and colors of bamboo or by feeding the hungry little panda. The art on the tiles is classic looking and the game play is simplistic without being boring. There&#039;s even a collector&#039;s edition with a 6&quot; panda and gardener figures and massive tiles. It&#039;s $299 but worth it if you really like the game. Myself though (if i was swimming in cash) I would put the collector&#039;s edition pieces on display and still play with the standard set. </comment>				</item>

There are some gaming mechanics within such as trying to complete goals chosen on cards at the start of the game and throughout. But mostly you are making decisions via multiple choice and hoping that things go well for you. Do you attack the beggar that requests a coin? Do you flirt with the princess that accidentally walks into you in the market? Choose carefully. You never know what might happen. No skill required. Just a decent imagination and about 2+ hours that you&#039;ll need to play. Not much of a game truly but still so so so much fun. </comment>				</item>

Some times you just want a simple romp through a fantasy world without having to manage your character&#039;s mana level or keep track of how damaged your axe has become. It is simplistic but that is what makes it work. We think it is a classic and will continue to enjoy it. </comment>				</item>

So we pounced on this one as soon as a friend told us about it.Thanks Erich. Lighthearted with just enough strategy to make it engrossing. Though the event cards in the game (bad habits &amp; illness) are just so annoying in game play that we&#039;ve pulled them out. A bit like Dominion only with theme. Check it out. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Vaccarino comes up with another great game that will no doubt still be overshadowed by Dominion. Cut the man a break. Look past the deck builder and try to judge his subsequent games not by Dominion but by the game itself. 
Temporum is a game about traveling through time and altering history in order to gain power to lead to victory. As good as the game play is the theme (like Kingdom Builder) isn&#039;t there. That said it is still a great game with terrific art, ease of game play and good tactical decisions to be made. Each turn you alter history to change the route through time you travel then play a card. It&#039;s as simple as that. Each card allows you to do a few different actions such as gain money, activate a temporary (or permanent) ability or score. 
The game can be very random and at times it is hard to make a strategy but the before-mentioned ease of game play mitigates this. </comment>				</item>

This is just plain childish fun locked into a board game that has some good mechanisms. At first glance you may think it&#039;s a kids game but there is some skill and planning involved. Not much mind you but enough to not make it simply a kid&#039;s game. So break it out and go on a RAMPAGE!</comment>				</item>

This fantasy themed deck builders has captured our imagination since we first heard about via the Dice Tower&#039;s Sam Healey. It is awesome.Have to believe it bogs down with more than 2 players but  could be wrong. We&#039;ve only ever played by ourselves. If you only get one deck builder get Thunderstone. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Maybe it&#039;s just that we know nothing about Numenera. But we cannot get into this one like the rest of Thunderstone Advance. The weird coupling of fantasy and sci-fi just doesn&#039;t mesh with us. Plus it isn&#039;t an expansion but a stand alone game. Odd. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>We enjoyed the original Ticket to Ride but since we were rarely able to play it with three or more players we felt like we were missing out. So we picked up a version designed specifically for 2-3 players and it is awesome. A bit more cutthroat than the original or Europe due to the board size and rail lines. We love this one. Plus the art is even better on this one thanks to the winter theme. </comment>				</item>

But it is an awesome deck builder. It&#039;s nice to be able to see your work grow on the board as you use cards to build routes and stations. Plus the artwork is so realistic it has us staring at the cards trying to decide whether it is a photograph or not. Maybe there&#039;ll be more of these deck builder with a board type games in the future. </comment>				</item>

A pyramid of cards is built and you buy from that adding to a tableau in front of you. Each card taken causes the pyramid to collapse making some items cheaper. Scoring is all about &quot;entombing&quot; artifacts that you have collected. 
But it just doesn&#039;t stack up to other deck builders. Maybe it&#039;s the limited number of cards. Maybe it&#039;s that the theme just isn&#039;t well represented. Maybe we are just used to deck builders being bigger and grander. A good game but just didn&#039;t hang around. </comment>				</item>

This is well deserved as one of our favorite Euros. The idea of controlling generations of a medieval family is genius and makes for a game that has you thinking from start to finish. Be warned. You are gonna forget that that worker in the blacksmith is about to pass away and try to use him further. You have to to think a few moves ahead in this game. While that is not normally something we like it games here it makes things more entertaining and sometimes even comedic. </comment>				</item>

It adds a little bit with the Inn cards that grant special abilities and some end game scoring factors. But if we never add it to another play we won&#039;t miss it. </comment>				</item>

Alas now 90% of the cards we had are gone and we&#039;ve just kept our core decks. If only we could have back all the cash we spent on this game. It was fun and occasionally still is. But clearly the time of Duel Monsters (that&#039;s what the game was called in the TV series) has come and gone we think. For us and many others. </comment>				</item>
