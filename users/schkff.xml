	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>This is the big one. After first opening the box, it is initially quite daunting to approach. The rulebook (unsurprisingly) is like nothing else, and for all its faults (some minor translation issues being the chief amongst them) the Book of Worlds is a staggering accomplishment in itself. Recommendation - do just read the rules for 123 and play that. Then pick whichever game is going to be played next, maybe set up the board (before anybody else shows up) and play through a turn. The rules seem to fall into place easier when the right components are in front of you. I&#039;m thinking that after a half dozen games of different modules, reading the individual rulesets might be less of a challenge, and just throwing together a game to play with a group there and then be much more feasible.

At the time of writing I am in the first tentative steps of exploring 504. That this is a game that really does have such vast scope for exploration of its potential forms is one of the most exciting things about it - leading this to being the first ever game that I had to buy on release, sight unseen.

It is undoubtedly a work of genius - are the games going to be great? I really couldn&#039;t say, and don&#039;t yet care. I&#039;ve played three games so far (123, 456 and 816) - enjoyed them, would play any of them again, but am eager to explore further. I don&#039;t know whether I am going to want to keep trying new combinations, or whether I&#039;ll find that there are certain worlds that I want to keep returning to. It&#039;s going to be interesting to find out!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>46</numplays>			<comment>Definitely a very enjoyable game, with the drafting element providing another new combination of old mechanics to make a building game enjoyableSpeed of play is obviously a big plus. For some reason, I don&#039;t feel particularly drawn to try to add this to my collection.

[Edit] Bought with Amazon credit, which helped bring the price to a respectable level (still £17 with sleeves, ow), as this is one of my wife&#039;s favourite games. We played a bit 2 player - which is decent, just high risk of burnout due to most cards getting seen every game. Definitely best with 3 or 4 owing to the strategic element of planning what to gamble on coming back into your hand.

It has gone up in my estimation owing to the fact that I TOTALLY ROCK AT THIS GAME, which clearly demonstrates that ist is a game that rewards sheer puissance and good breeding.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Battle against the Rat Men! You can tell there wasn&#039;t a lot of competition when this came out. Slightly more point to it if you already have a substantial collection of monster miniatures. The tables for generating solo dungeons in the old AD&amp;D DM&#039;s guide are better than this flimsy product. Comes complete with swinging doors, though! And a bunch of identical rat men! What larks, Pip!
Edit : my original ratings of 2 then 3 seem a bit harsh. The quality of the tiles is pretty good, and as an expansion for Heroquest it is probably pretty useful. Can&#039;t help but compare the rule set to things like the solo dungeoneering tables printed in an issue of Warlock magazine, which I&#039;m pretty sure had more meat to them than the effort made for AHQ
Edit again (April 2011): And having had another look at the rules, having picked up a copy from a charity shop, I have to concede that there is something interesting about how the ruleset approach dungeon-crawling as a boardgame - eg the idea that the GM has to follow a set of rules and randomly generate a dungeon during play. Is this what WHQ refined? The tiles are also well-suited to this purpose. May try playing some time.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I like this, but after one two and one four player game, still find it a bit clunky; interaction is limited by the game design, poor choices aren&#039;t punished enough (too many opportunities to catch up). The end game stages and crowning of Conan are interesting, and the tension of the &#039;micro-games&#039; are enjoyable, but so far for me, the whole feels a bit laborious. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Seems to have a good level of appeal to players of either a euro or theme game disposition. Tense, involving, gameplay moves at a steady pace. Many paths to victory, and players must react to the strategies of everybody else at the table. All round a good, solid game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>109</numplays>			<comment>I never really get why so many people are down on farming as a theme - did they not have toy tractors and an assortment of plastic animals in different scales as a kid? Playing with little wooden sheep and cows appeals to something on a very fundamental level. With the different modes of play (which can cover the range from light, family fun to an intense strategic &amp; tactical challenge) and the vast number of optional decks of cards, there is a ridiculous amount of game in this box. 

At somewhere over a hundred plays, I&#039;m not by any means burned out on the game, but enjoy it as an occasional indulgence rather than a weekly entertainment. That&#039;s a decent amount of play for one game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>(Bought as part of the great Works £7.99 sale of 2011). 2-player: The components are very nice, I like the implementation of theme through the mechanics which make sense to me. But overall, it seems to be missing something. At the moment it plays like Settlers without random resource collection (much like the Roman themed iPhone settlers clone, is this a coincidence?). The bones of the game and the bits are too nice not to hope that somebody can come up with an interesting variation - maybe having different win condition (eg earning vps), more ways to directly screw with each other (legionaries being able to seize &#039;tributes&#039; from the production plants) and maybe even dice added to combat. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>An enjoyable game, very nicely themed and produced. Funnily enough, it seems to come down to the luck of the dice most of the time, but the game is still reasonably fun for all that. Better than Kingsburg, but not exactly a million miles above Yahtzee (which I don&#039;t particularly mean as a criticism as I also quite enjoy playing that from time to time).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Over the top FFG production values, combined with bargain basement prices mean that I would be happy for this game to sit on my shelves virtually unplayed and unlikely to be played - which is essentially the situation. I can see this going down very well with the right group of players, although the necessity to learn a bunch of odd mechanics is a necessary barrier, as according to comments here on the geek is the &#039;fit up a suspect&#039; rather than &#039;solve a mystery&#039; gameplay - not a problem for me personally:it seems to fit in well with the dystopian sf background, and makes for an interesting and very gamey mechanic - always useful in a board game. 
Edit after a proper 4 player game: Plays extremely well and fits my expectations above. For me the biggest problems were - 
1) having to go through the rule book to give a rules explanation owing to not having &#039;revised&#039; properly before play - with set up this took about an hour and greatly annoyed Mrs Schkff. Solution: prepare properly
 2)all the flavour text being a bit messy - we opted not to go through the procedure of everybody reading out their text so it was optional for players if they wanted to read their own flavour text or not. The game manages to flow on reasonably well almost completely ignoring the text, but some sense of the story is lost a bit here. As with the rules explanation, this problem was really just down to our own approach to the game, and did not spoil play. Solution: either want to read the text, or be happy ignoring it; not a particularly big deal.
3) Mrs Schkff being impatient about how long I apparently took on my turns, whilst wanting to stop and check if she was able to play a dark card on every player after what seemed like every single move. Grr. Solution: Do not play Android with Mrs Schkff.
4) Some annoying vagueness about how to use the day marker track, and a number of questions about the conspiracy board. Solution: read the rules properly.
All these problems aside, this was an intense and for three of us very enjoyable game, which in the end could have gone either way - this with a great variety in the strategy and approaches each player took. The whole evidence planting mechanic is pure genius, far more interesting than any deduction game could possibly be. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>100</numplays>			<comment>Game play is absolutely superb - if you have the right gaming partner and don&#039;t care about the outside world, then you could get a hell of a lot of play out of the core set alone. There&#039;s much to be learned about playing this game well, and it relies on more fundamental gaming skills than just knowledge of cards - ie, bluffing, reading intent, managing risk and putting your neck out, boldness and invention. I really like it.

Can&#039;t keep up with the sale model, though. It&#039;s really great that the entire game is affordable if that&#039;s your gaming focus, but it&#039;s not so great if your budget is limited, though that is what it is. There&#039;s nothing stopping a deck without Clone Chips or Jackson Howard or currents or whatever going up against a netdeck tricked out with every flash card going and still scoring a win - or even just enjoying a good game (though getting pummelled)...

If you live in an urban area where there are a lot of Netrunner players meeting up regularly for games, you are depriving yourself of a delicious addiction if you don&#039;t give it a try. It is a game that demands real commitment, though - not so much because you have to stay up to date to stay competitive (though you largely do), but because it is that good of a game in itself. Which is no bad thing.

I did as badly as on my first games of Imperial and Imperial 2030, but I didn&#039;t experience that desire to have another go to try and get it right. Maybe just because it is a similar game, and I can only take so much hammering. Wouldn&#039;t turn down a game, though.</comment>				</item>

I enjoy Antike as a multi-player, and I love Hamburgum both multi and two player, think I would enjoy Imperial 2030 2 player. So I like Antike Duellum, but will need to play more to know whether it will really hold out for me. 

What I can say is that the game is superb value for money bits-wise - double-sided map, lots of nice wooden pieces, small box, pleasing art and graphic design - all for under £20: bargain. But will I always end up playing some other 2-player? Not yet decided.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Yet to play. Want to like this, although I am dubious about &#039;flavour text&#039; in games - if I want to enjoy bad writing I&#039;ll read Lovecraft, who does it best. 

After 1 play : Ok, the rule book deserves all the criticism, but this is no Magic Realm. Gameplay is reasonably smooth, and I have to say, so far, I am really liking it. Plus the wife actually enjoyed it a lot more than our previous co-op experience (Lord of the Rings and Pandemic), in spite of the fact that it took us nearly 4 hours to play.

Flavour text seems snappier than in Runebound, the theme is wonderfully worked. Shame about the Ghoul illustration (which is even accompanied by a description of the &#039;canine&#039; features) - that ain&#039;t no Lovecraftian Ghoul, I must mewl.

Considerably exceeded expectations.

2015 edit:I eventually sold all my Arkham stuff - it never got played, and took up too much space. I bought Elder Signs as a replacement. Something about the comparative size and simplicity appealed to me. If space and money weren&#039;t an issue, though, Arkham might have stayed. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Ugh. I really wonder what it is I am missing here. This just isn&#039;t a game! These early games that &#039;solved&#039; the problem of theme-lack in Dominion are a travesty. Maybe it gets better with expansions?

2015 Edit: I do quite enjoy the phone version from time-to-time, however. My earlier &quot;isn&#039;t a game&quot; verdict should be &quot;isn&#039;t a game that has much appeal for me&quot;. And the Dominion &#039;solvers&#039; aren&#039;t a travesty - but I still don&#039;t think any beat the original for genuine, solid game play. I wouldn&#039;t play Ascension on the phone if I had an equally well-implemented Dominion app. Star Realms gets what this does right, I reckon. BTW, played this online a bit and got fairly regularly beat, so I guess that there must be something more than luck of the draw/buy the best card involved! Rating upped to a 5</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>30</numplays>			<comment>Games like Backgammon and Chess that are an everyday feature of life in certain cultures, and that have been so for many centuries, have an enormous appeal. Do the differences between chess and backgammon say anything about the cultures and personalities that prefer them? It&#039;s curious how backgammon usually comes in the form of a case, which implies mobility; there is a luxuriousness in the manufacture of backgammon sets rather than the sometimes ascetic quality found even with an expensive chess set (ignoring the novelty display sets of course) - and yet backgammon is the easier game to play where pebbles and sand are the only materials to hand. 

The most fundamental difference between the two games, of course, is that with the combination of luck and calculable probabilities, backgammon is a game about betting, if not the game about betting (where it trumps poker, as there is a playable game even without stakes on the table).

I find something more satisfying about teaching people how to play classic games than I do any modern euro; I think that this is a combination of the simplicity and elegance that is a fundamental concept behind any game that has survived as a classic (I include chess in this definition, but obviously backgammon is simpler and easier to teach), with the cultural weight and value that such games have. Unfortunately, so far your euro game only has a cultural weight and significance to nerds and geeks: hence this (fine fine!) website, and the relatively low ranking of the classics thereon.</comment>				</item>

I bought a copy in the Puffin Book Club, some time in the early 1980s (I think), and played these games to death - my first experience of war-gaming, indeed of anything beyond Monopoly and Cluedo. It led to an initial disappointment when I ordered Forest of Doom, my first Fighting Fantasy book, to be very confused to get a game book that didn&#039;t have a board or pieces.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>26</numplays>			<comment>Enjoyable and fast as a 2 player abstract. Games are &#039;played out&#039; much quicker than the full game, but speed of play is one of the attractions. If you want a meatier game, go for one of the big brothers with 2 colours apiece. Would prefer an edition with a built-in, plastic carrying case.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>32</numplays>			<comment>I really like Blokus, and at first this version seems less satisfying, as it&#039;s much harder to block and get a grip on. But the more I play, the more I feel I get it. Add the scalability - thi plays excellently (though differently) with 2, 3, or 4 - and the fact that you can make MUCH PRETTIER PATTERNS WITH TRIANGLES, leads to the inevitable conclusion : Blokus Trigon is the one version of Blokus that you must own!
(Edit April 2011): My comment above is no doubt weighted by the fact that this is the version of Blokus I have stumbled across cheap to buy. It has all the merits I have listed, but I think that there is an indefinable something to Blokus Classic - or even a definable something, which is to say that it is easier to block and to visualise moves. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>14</numplays>			<comment>The theme is an instant winner for me. Maybe an interest in the industrial revolution and North West England helps. Numerous strategies for success, but a player must be flexible depending on what cards they are dealt, and upon what strategies their oponents are pursuing. Really, really like this game. Wallace&#039;s best ever?

The two player variant is worthwhle, and even though there are no shortage of games to play for 2, I don&#039;t think there is much competition for a serious economic game. 

4 player is clearly where this game is best - the competition is insane, and there is something really delightful about the struggle to find an economic niche. But three player is solid too, altho I think there may be more risk of a player&#039;s lead to snowball if allowed to dominate an industry - so don&#039;t let em.

If playing this with me, be prepared to get fed up at my shaking my head and saying &quot;I really, really love this game&quot; periodically.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>Far more visually appealing than vanilla - how can you not love the little dudes riding pigs? - I also love the way that it encourages much more logical building, somewhat counter-intuitively in spite of the less restricted spacing rules. Scoring system has crazy randomness, which evens the playing field in a way that demand fun.

I prefer playing Carc on a limited space table anyway, so the castle actually seems somewhat spacious.   

Copy I have played had some sub-standard production -eg, peeling tiles, and very poor fit on the &#039;jigsaw&#039; pieces. </comment>				</item>

It&#039;s like pool that you can 1) carry with you to the pub, 2) Doesn&#039;t cost £1 - £2 per game, 3) plays doubles really well, and 4) you don&#039;t have to get  up off your arse to take a shot! What&#039;s not to love?

Would like to play a full size board some day, am happy with kids size until I can actually make a shot more than 1 time in 10.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>48</numplays>			<comment>Simple, yet very satisfying abstract chase game. Open card variant allows plenty of potential for brain-burning AP, should you go in for that kind of thing. 

Picked this up in a sale at Forbidden Planet for £2.99. Nice!

Edit : (after about 9 months) Remains a big favourite for me and the missus. Still one of the most satisfying games for 2 players in our collection. Doesn&#039;t quite seem to have the same fun factor as other acquisitions (Portobello Market, Downfall of Pompeii) when broken out as a &#039;gateway&#039; game, but still a reliable choice. 

Also, I often manage to beat my wife, which is becoming a rarity of anything we play. Double plus. </comment>	<conditiontext>Very good condition (so far) - not sure what I&#039;d trade for as it fits a very important 2p niche, but am open to offers.</conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll get to play this more in the years to come, as it seems assured of classic status. I find the small pieces and colour choices a bit of an annoyance. The old &#039;multi-player solitaire criticism&#039; applies well here - but that is often exactly the kind of game I want to play. Although they&#039;ve had a real renaissance in the last few years, Feld deserves kudos for his continued use of the humble dice. Certainly they should ensure continued replayability with this delicious vp-cruncher game.</comment>				</item>

What is truly amazing is the amount of space this game can take up - far more than even 6 player Catan, more in fact than War of the Ring or even Arkham plus - in fact only Sorcerer&#039;s Cave in my collection takes up more playing space...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I can understand why people may love this game, but I have probably found it the least enjoyable of the worker-placement games I have played so far. Extremely ugly and garish board and component design, laborious play. Has merits which I may grow to appreciate if badgered into playing again, eg admittedly a continued sense of involvement. First play wasn&#039;t helped by the fact that the explainer went into great depth about the mechanics, without giving any of the &#039;theme&#039; explanations of what the hell we were actually doing and whatever all the little cubes were supposed to represent. It really underlined the whole &#039;book-keeping&#039; nature of the game. Plus he was hyper-competitive, talking players out of making any decision that adversely affected himself, ho-hum. On the whole I was disappointed by the game as I find the box art appealing and intruiging. 
Edit (Oct 2010): I finally got to play Caylus in more amenable circumstances, and enjoyed it very much. Plus I won, which helps a lot in the game appreciation stakes. Deep and involving, but possibly too long if facing competition from other games that scratch a similar itch.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Can&#039;t help but wonder why someone would go to the trouble of reworking a board game to come up with an ever so slightly less complex version, utilising cards in a board game fashion, and encumbered by all the cubes and markers - Caylus MC certainly does not take the San Juan path of elegance in approaching its original.

However, I am glad that they did. The randomness of the shuffled building cards counters a great deal of the dryness of the original, whilst still requiring thought and strategy from the player. 

Acquiring this in the Works £7.99 sale (along with the Ystari expansion box for £2.99) means that I am unlikely to bother hunting down a copy of the board game.

Edit: I am finding this a bit unsatisfactory with just 2 players. If one player goes ahead they tend to stay ahead, and there can be a considerable difference in the luck of the draw on cards. Don&#039;t think this would be anything like as much of an issue with even one more player.

I may be saying this because my wife keeps beating me, as she does with Ingenious and Roll Through the Ages.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Actually, although I lusted after this I don&#039;t think I ever played it BITD, even though my mate had a copy - which he recently passed on to me. It is worth critics remembering - this board game was made before the first-person-shooter video game genre existed beyond our fevered imaginations. It seems that there is enough in the box to cobble together something a little more interesting to play, ie with just a few decisions to make during play. The Brett Ewins art is the biggest selling point - shame it wasn&#039;t ewins on the cards though. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>Just wish to be clear that the relatively low rating is based on my hesitation to play, although I do go through phases of being fired up about the game. Half an hour spent reading up on basic strategy ought to open up the game for most people, and disprove the usual silly objections about it being a game that rewards memorizing sequences of opening moves. Not that people have to like chess, but when BGGers call the game &#039;broken,&#039; well, they sound a little bit ridiculous. 

First game my wife and I played together. Mrs Schkff comes from one of those cultures where chess is routinely played in school and everybody knows how to play.

Edit : am upping my rating, as there&#039;s no way I&#039;d turn down a game or three, and am happy being beaten by someone who can really play, or else coaching someone in the basics. Chess is fun! 

Theme somewhat pasted on, though, it has to be admitted. And what self-respecting king would marry a pawn, just because it made its way across a battlefield? Tsk.  

Edit again 2014: Rating dropped a point again - am just not feeling the Chess love at the moment. Thjis may change as the kids get old enough to learn.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Enjoyed this a lot. The production is very nice. Can&#039;t decide whether I prefer this or Steel Driver, which is more elegant as a game, but less engaging for theme. The little share certificates in CE may be the deciding factor. I am shallow.
Edit (Oct 2010): I think I do prefer Steel Driver, really, but am glad that Wabash Cannonball is now on the iPhone. And CE is often temptingly cheap, so this may eventually see its way into my game collection. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Only played the intro game of 3 conferences. I think I&#039;d like this more after playing the full game - in the shorter scenario, the victory conditions kind of rapidly swung out of control of the players, and of course you don&#039;t get the narrative of pushing through DDay and so on. Really interesting to play something simulating this level of command; brought to mind Wallace&#039;s &quot;God&#039;s Playground&quot; (3p competitive but working against common enemies). </comment>				</item>

Certainly beefs up rooks and queens by another few factors - which may not be what chess needs, but is fun. Pow!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>42</numplays>			<comment>Mostly played two player with Mrs Schkff, who loves it provided she wins. I sympathise with people who hate this game, as I would usually play something else. Really does scale very well from 2 to 7. The person who hates playing the most always gets assassinated on the first round, and then sulks for the remainder of the game. Tiresome in large groups if peole are stricken with AP - just choose the f*ing architect and pass the deck!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I wanted to like this more than I did, but I certainly didn&#039;t dislike it. I feel that the balance of the game makes it a real challenge to do anything other than get in the arms race. But it has a lot of really nice features, and of course great over-the-top Z-man production - slightly let down as ever by the less than first rate actual component quality. I think I would generally prefer to play either TTA or just a straight up multi player war game. Or Eclipse, which I think gets the balance better in spite of its own flaws. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>22</numplays>			<comment>Splendid game, scoring extremely highly for playability, ease of set-up, variety, production, and value for money. Other games are going to be judged by the standards of this one for years to come. I think if it had passed the Vasel test this would be in the BGG top ten already. The sheer tactile pleasure of holding the solidly constructed, weighty box is almost disturbing... Thematic Game of the Year and 2 player Game of the Year 2010, without hesitation. The one minor quibble is problems distinguishing the Condemned minis and having to use a generic demon - Asmodee must rectify this by producing a booster pack of alternate figures, including the other demons and figures armed with the blundebus, shield etc, or I will be forced to downgrade this to a 1 out of spite. [Edit:] That&#039;s a joke about the spite-rating, but I am a bit surprised that alternative miniature packs weren&#039;t marketed for this game seeing as the game is based on a line of miniatures. I&#039;m too lazy to find proxies. </comment>	<conditiontext>Played a number of times, cards all sleeved and general condition very good - some damage to the box including a split down one side however.</conditiontext>	<wantpartslist>Want parts as yet unmade - ie, Blade w. Blunderbus, Brute w shield, and all those other demons. And I want them now!</wantpartslist>		</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>One play so far. Confusing to play out of the box without anyone having played it before (same could be said of plenty of decent games), and some passages of the rules add to this by being a bit headachey; but eventually it clicked. Quite a delightful game, really. Is the scoring range too small, and the results of the voting for government office too swingy? Perhaps, but there appears to be a lot of potential here for deep and devious play, leavened by luck, that draw me to playing again.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>I remember struggling and failing to understand this when it (GW edition) came out, I guess when I was 13. But I was really drawn to it, and wanted to like it. 

Picked up a copy in trade a while back, finally got to play the FFG edition, on learning that far from being better with more, 3 is a perfectly acceptable number to play with.

The game has proven to be everything I wanted it to be; intensely enjoyable. The anticipation before a game, wondering what combo the powers will provide this time (and will they - can I force them to? - favour me?) is sublime.

Love both versions - altho Flares are neat, there&#039;s something just right in the GW ed balance.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>This is probably not a game that I would have ended up buying were it not in the famous £7.99 sale at The Works. To date I have only played it two player - for which it is absolutely essential to use one of the variants for dealing with the ships, something I find a little annoying design-wise (that the game requires some tinkering to scale for fewer players, and that this didn&#039;t seem to be picked up on in play testing.) 

But this is nonetheless an enjoyable and challenging game, with an interesting range of strategies for players to explore (all of which must, however, be undertaken with the understanding that this is a game which very quickly reaches its end stages).

It feels quite different from Puerto Rico to play, in spite of superficial similarities. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Entertaining. For me, the balance of co-op to hidden objectives is about right. Seem to be a lot of flaky cards, which can be forgiven, but might lead to problems depending on how a group play. Some objectives far easier to achieve than others, though that&#039;s somewhat of a minor quibble - I like that exact balance wasn&#039;t considered necessary in the design, it should be possible to enjoy this without it. 

Overall, play experience can be much greater than the sum of the parts. The atmosphere generated in the game really fits the setting.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>I own D1e but still haven&#039;t played it - traded it a while ago but had limited interest off other players to try it. Playing 2e has rekindled my interest in trying out 1st. 

Things I like - the sculpts are vastly superior on the minis and the scales seem in better proportion - too many ginormous models in 1e for my taste. Art again is a vast improvement - the character art in particular. Also, general aesthetics, layout, etc are all several notches up. And minimal need to refer to rules is commnedable. Play itself: So as stated, I haven&#039;t experienced the notorious 5 hour drudgery of 1e&#039;s kill cycle, although I suspect I would get a kick out of it. 

The colour to the scenarios is a lot of fun, but I wonder if they have much replayability. Most are over very quickly, and tend to have odds stacked to one side or the other, with this being offset by only minimal impact of winning or losing. Bizarrely the most significant encounters can be the random road encounters (my crew took a bigger haul of items from one of these cards than across two scenarios). But I do like the pace of progression - which is to say tantalisingly slow. It&#039;s the progression experience of an RPG campaign condensed across a couple of weeks rather than a couple of years or (in D1e&#039;s case) a couple of hours. Playing the OL seems inherently less interesting, with fewer choices and decisions than 1e gave. 

On the whole, 2e seems to be a really good intro to 1e - but until I actually experience 1e for myself I should avoid drawing conclusions from my experience so far. Enjoyed it a lot, but it leaves me wanting more. Will my 1st edition plus the cards from the expansions (thanks to the secondary market caused by 2e on 1e cannibalization) and Road to Legend satisfy that craving? Time will tell... </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>First Impressions: I don&#039;t really know why I preordered this except that I am pretty much a Wallace fanboy, and did enjoy the first few Discworld novels as a teenager. I am wary that my opinion may change, but I have certainly enjoyed the game so far after 4 2player games against Mrs Schkff. The board is a lot more important to the game than the one in London (to take another Wallace card game themed on a chaotic and malodorous metropolis as an example), the randomness is fun, and balanced by the fact that the cards only come in a small number of different types. Also, the trouble mechanic is classic Wallace - at first seems odd, then proves simple, thematic and gamey. The system wouldn&#039;t accept a 7a rating, and 9 seems a bit high just yet (might get there though) so for now this is a safe 7. 
[Edit after first 4 player game]: People who think that Vimes always wins are bufoons. Sorry, but this is true.
[Edit after reading Guards! Guards! for the first time] I can&#039;t get over how true to the spirit of Pratchett&#039;s writing this game is. Love it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Draughts, with the option to move pieces of board as well as playing pieces. Superb concept, but gameplay doesn&#039;t quite live up to the premise, as either owing to flakiness of rules or some fundamental flaw in concept, draws have to be deliberately avoided. Nice bits though!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I thought this was fun. There is a touch of the blands about it, but it&#039;s good to have another choice for take-thatism. Nice compnents, seems to be good value. Somehow the rhythm of the game felt like Cosmic Encounter to me, for reasons that I haven&#039;t bothered to properly analysed. With that in mind, I would alwatys prefer to play CE, but might consider owning this in order to have a more portable game in that ilk. 

Full disclosure: I am not all that arsed about any post-Tom Baker Doctor Who, but think the recent attempts have been worthwhile, and some of the episodes (well, Blink anyway) have even actually been good.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A very solid game, with the somewhat admirable yet curious feature of being almost dangerously long for modern board gaming. I like the aesthetic and the cover art, on the whole in this category (of sneaky/combative area majority scoring games) I think I prefer Age of Empires III (more fun) and Confucious (more interesting). Does kind of surprise me how highly rated it is here on BGG, which I would choose to take as a positive sign that long, serious games are by no means out of fashion. Stiff competition, I would have thought though, from faster playing weighty games, such as Hansa Teutonica. </comment>				</item>

Playing in dominoe drives at the village hall was a highlight of the year as a kid. Have moved back to more rural location and am pleased to see from the local papers that domino drives are still a big part of village life. Am tempted to go to one some time and try and rock their world with Chicken Foot ( because standard British dominoes is a pretty lame game by comparison ). </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Couldn&#039;t resist the lure of this. For Space Hulk I was happy to buy the game sans models and use earlier marines and stealers; in this case, I had to have the whole thing. Once painted, will I ever get a chance to play it? Feasibly not, but I hope so. 

Biggest pull was the lavish John Blanche art and general Blanchesque aesthetic, surely some of his best GW work? Admittedly, I haven&#039;t seen much GW stuff since the late 80s, so maybe I&#039;ve missed some gems. 

Edit: Finished, the game looks absolutely as ravishing as photos lead one to expect. This really bears the hallmarks of a labour of love for someone or ones at GW. I have played a few games. The game itself is OK, sthe mechanism for event cards/wind I found a bit of an annoyance. Playing with the ships though is just great, and the overall gameplay experience is situationally sublime (but mostly I would certainly just prefer to play something better).

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Very nice graphics and art. A fun game. At any given time your seating may determine whether you can actually make a meaningful choice or not - there&#039;s a lot of working out what the next players can/must play; but it is quick and entertaining. There are similar games mechanics-wise that may be better play-wise, but the theme is very nicely worked in and overall production a treat. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>I played New Dungeon! a lot in my mid teens, alongside Dungeonquest, Sorcerer&#039;s Cave, Talisman, and actual AD&amp;D. Altho this was the simplest and least intrinsically interesting of the bunch, I found that I usually enjoyed it, as fast brainless fun.

Bought the new edition and it has gone down well with my 2 and 4 year olds. For me the plusses are much improved art and the compactness - and needless to say costing £12 delivered! Well-worth getting if you have kids who you want to grow up into D&amp;D nerds. Dubious merit otherwise.

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>Fun, probably especially because of its near impossibility. I have this with the Catacombs expansion, and am increasingly of the opinion that it is better without (although the amulets are a nice addition). One deeply annoying feature is having to continually refer to the various Ryle books to find out the effect of a card - only to learn that it&#039;s &quot;Take 1d12 - armour damage&quot; - why couldn&#039;t they include this text on the cards. Keep meaning to take some fineline coloured markers to my cards sometime to rectify this.

	<numplays>28</numplays>			<comment> A modern classic - the monster AI was a ground-breaking innovation, much imitated. The game is fast, fun, and beautifully made. The minis are exceptional quality and value. Later iterations implemented a lot of good ideas, but certainly of the first three games I found this the most fun to play - possibly because it is tough, certainly I found the scenarios to be most interesting. The encounters are deadly, so the game can be very challenging to beat - but some combinations of characters are much stronger than others (include the wizard in your party if you want a challenge, and don&#039;t have the cleric in play - cleric+fighter is a pretty tough team). I play it more either solo or with kids than with other adults, but have really enjoyed all my plays so far.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>2010: Liking the look of this, will eventually get round to painting the figures, although they are really good as they are. Hope to play it with the kids one day, this looks like it may well be an improvement on Heroquest, let alone its successor. The failure of a US release seems inexplicable, but perhaps that itself paved the way for Ravenloft, so all is good.
2014 Edit after a few plays with the kids (ages 6,4 and 3) - fantastic game for this kind of thing. The complexity level is just right. Still not painted the figures - I am enjoying the glossy, garish colours.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Legend of Drizzt (for my money, and after one play) improves on some areas where people have found flaws in Ravenloft&#039;s design. The encounter cards are less arbitrary and take-thatish, feel more integrated to the board: for example, there are cards that trigger damage from specific tiles (those marked with lava vents) which definitely works better than the entirely random events in Ravenloft. Although the game order is still the same, there are now heroes with powers that allow them to avoid or lessen the effect of a new monster&#039;s first strike. As a result, heroes are much, much tougher than in Ravenloft - to make up somewhat for this (but not entirely, the game is definitely easier now), there are now some considerably stronger wandering monsters (eg Feral Troll). 

I also like small touches such as that &#039;monster piles&#039; (&#039;shrooms in this version) are sometimes placed on the cards in places which could occasionally make them adjacent to an exploring hero, and the fact that there is a little bit more variety in monsters from the standard 3 of a kind in CR and WoA.

I guess the fact that these changes have been made acknowledges that the original design can be improved upon. I don&#039;t think the changes will be enough for people who found Ravenloft or Ashardalon completely lacking in charm, but those who have problems with the game but still find themselves inexplicably drawn to it just might be happier with the latest incarnation. 

I suspect that the variety of monsters and villains of the original are more to my taste still, but time will tell on that score. I have no interest at all in either the Ravenloft or Drizzt brands, which is no hindrance for me. The silly unpronouncable names are a big plus, but why is Drzzzzzzt&#039;s pet cat named after King Arthur&#039;s wife? Odd.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>More great miniatures, interesting mix of monsters, tweaks to the tiles and the inclusion of doors handled very well. Treasure deck seems to have gone from under- to over-powered, but that&#039;s actually perfect for the purpose of combining the two decks. In general, it is impressive how well this game stands on its own AND combines and complements Ravenloft. 

I like the action pose on the half-orc character, and he has some pretty neat abilities. Introduction of gold for purpose of campaigns of multiple adventures is a neat touch - not being able to level up beyond 2? Pfft, don&#039;t care. The notion that a &#039;campaign&#039; would be an evening of 3 or 4 adventures back-to-back makes a lot more sense to me than something of the scope of an RPG or Road to Legend. 

For those who really do want a dungeon-crawler that&#039;ll play in under an hour, and which once painted looks pretty, this franchise is going from strength to strength.

What really does surprise me is that the changes from Ravenloft seem to have been made in response to some of the criticisms/suggestions after that game - with the timeframe between releases, that is very impressive, and bodes particularly well for the next game in line.

Edit (July 2011): Shaved a point off my rating of this because, in spite of the improvements, in spite of the more classic D&amp;D mix of monsters,I am finding that I somewhat prefer Ravenloft. One factor is the treasures in Ashardalon, which multiply through the game. The too much fiddling about with cards phenomena is worsened by the things like the Event cards that stack the deck for certain monsters - they seem a bit on the pointless side. The adventures don&#039;t feel like they have the same degree of character and appeal as Ravenloft, perhaps just being a touch clunkily and unimaginatively written. Yeah, not like Ravenloft&#039;s writing would go up against Vance or Wolfe, but there&#039;s something indefinable there that gives me a preference for the first game. Perverse, I know. I do like the doors and the horrid chambers.

Edit, October 2011: Sold/traded to acquire Dreadfleet, Waterloo and Shogun. I am still a bit in shock that I did this, as I really like the game and painting the minis was a labour of love, but faced with the need to get rid of something big to get spousal approval for Dreadfleet acquisition, I couldn&#039;t help but reflect that I just prefer Ravenloft, and as good as this is, I just don&#039;t need two D&amp;D boardgames. I will miss it, but I think the new games will help me get over that. After all, I&#039;ve had this 10 months, and only played it twice in all that time. Ashardalon Farewell!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Although my only play of this game so far was tedious in the extreme, I can see it being better with the right players, so I&#039;d be reasonably happy to give it another shot. To me the games design feels a bit loose and somewhat bland, although I do quite like the graphic design and aesthetic.For epic multi player combat games, I would contrast the experience with A Game of Thrones and the Starcraft Boardgame - in both those games two players getting locked into a feud still have a chance of winning I would think (albeit one greatly reduced) - in Eclipse the cost of combat is too great, as other players can just keep building up their units and capabilities, with nothing to hold them in check. 

(Edit after a second play, 3 players): The timing of conflict is important in this game, and will change depending on the actions of players. The game rewards early conflict, but I guess that Monoliths and Plasma Missiles between them provide two very effective answers to a purely military strategy - by all means, build your killer fleet, but don&#039;t expect the game to be a walkover. With 3 players was a very fun way to spend 3 hours, and my earlier experience was considerably mollified. Rating upped!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>I really enjoyed this, although some of the rule/card combo fuzziness did begin to bug me a little. If I do ever sell my ridiculous Arkham Horror collection (ridiculous in that it is almostunplayed, I think I am mostly hanging on to it in the vague hope that my kids will love it in about 8 to 10 years time), then I&#039;ll probably get this to have some of the flavour in a neat little package. As I still have Arkham though, I find that the phone app is enough to satisfy the occassional urge to play. Nice dice, and a neat little package. Fun solo, don&#039;t know if i&#039;d really enjoy the cooperative mode. 

I sold my ridiculous Arkham collection. This fills the niche, and saves the shelf space.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Enjoy the combination of worker placement and civilization development, enjoy the theme, thumbs up. Cons include fiddly set up and, perhaps, the merest suggestion that this might be a game that has been a smidgeon over-developed, with a somewhat committee-created feel to it. Glad that they were able to include both slavery and conflict in a game themed on colonialism, it would have been a little bit silly without them. 

Edit: Weird how this one dropped so quickly out of favour in gaming circles. Merits - speed of play, simplicity, variability of set-up, excellent component production. Best with 4 or 5.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Visually the game is very appealing, although once I got my head around how it is actually played, I was struck by very &quot;Oh, is that it?&quot; sentiments. It doesn&#039;t seem to do much of interest that other games don&#039;t already do, and the theme feels a bit wasted. Rubbed me the wrong way to learn that part of the board was only included as a kickstarter bonus - so the game would have been different if fewer people backed it? 

The lack of mitigation of lucky rolls is the game&#039;s real flaw, though, and pretty unforgivable in design terms. Most other worker placement games I&#039;ve played are better as games. 

Pretty, though.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>The controversy surrounding this game is instructive, and an important discussion. It seems a shame though that so many people who haven&#039;t actually played the game have written it off as broken as a result. For me, a neat game, and one of the first really great games to follow Dominion using a deck-building mechanism - more importantly the first board game to successfully fuse deck building into its play - My opinion, of course, with little regard for the dissenters. I haven&#039;t played enough to run in to the Halifax Hammer - if I did, or if I generally found deck-thinning overpowered, I&#039;d probably follow Mantuanwar&#039;s suggested variant rather than Mr Wallace&#039;s proposed fix - but it hasn&#039;t come up, so we&#039;ve just played RAW. It&#039;s a really beautiful production too, if you find any appeal in the Treefrog aesthetic, and represents its chosen period of history beautifully.   </comment>				</item>

I don&#039;t think I enjoy this kind of thing with four players - if it&#039;s going to be an intense conflict, make it a 2player, or keep it where I can grasp it (like War of the Roses).</comment>				</item>

&#039;Co-op&#039; is the new &#039;Roll-and-move&#039;, it seems.

Edit: four 10 ratings for this?! Please get hold of a pnp copy and try it - I know nothing about the licensing hoo-ha, but as a game this just doesn&#039;t make the grade. Apologies to the designers - better luck with your next project.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Solid - I like this. The components and integration of setting are up to the publisher&#039;s usual superlative standard, as is the price - I&#039;m sure they could have asked twice as much and got it.

However, there are better games in the genre. Merchant of Venus is better as a game - flows much better and has real economic drive. Merchants and Marauders is tighter as an adventure game. But, if you love Firefly and you like adventure games, aren&#039;t too fussy about the rigour of the ruleset, then run don&#039;t walk, it&#039;s a gem.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Decent game in a small box. My back is always got up a bit by kickstarter exclusives - I don&#039;t like the idea that games are getting designed with bits that will taken out in the commercial edition - but I rather suspect that the simplicity of the base game benefits from lack of exclusive add ons. Very punishing, but mercifully over quickly. 2p is decent, but probably better to play something else.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Yeah, this is good. I like the bits of StarCraft that have been ditched - the combat and the tech tree. But what has been added, particularly the way goals work, really makes this game a solid improvement on the earlier iteration. I might be tempted to replace StarCraft with this.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A nice traditional puzzle game, with fine foxles and geeples in this edition. So apparently it&#039;s solved: I acannot help but wonder every time I see that comment on a game whether the commentor has actually worked out /learned the solution themselves, or whether they&#039;ve just heard/read that it&#039;s solved and so dismissed any further investigation.  Assuming that it is indeed &#039;solved&#039;, I think that this nonetheless represents a nice half way mark between game and puzzle.</comment>				</item>

Worth playing from time to time, better with fewer players, most fun of course for Drac. </comment>				</item>

We played the anniversary edition with a lot thrown in, so I don&#039;t know for sure how well the base game plays unexpanded, but I can&#039;t believe that it wouldn&#039;t still be a good laugh.

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment> This is a very involving game, absolutely minimal down time, and from the second turn the tree of possible moves and interactions pretty much explodes, so that it seems unlikely that any two games will be the same, and players must keep their wits about them. The mechanics seem appropriate to the theme, even though the euro-ish nature of many mechanics (the various checks and balances, and of course luckless combat) will not appeal to everybody - they should appeal to plenty, though, and for my taste really make the game, as its fascinating how uncertain things can be in spite of the lack of dice. This is by no means a unique feature to this game, but here (as compared say to War of the Roses Lancaster vs York) it somehow manages to achieve the Ameritrash feel. 

I own but have not yet played 1st edition, so can&#039;t really comment on the play differences in editions, but would say that graphically the components of this edition are much more pleasing, and though I would prefer them in wood, the plastics pawns are nice enough.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>The ultimate stratego board. Did not dare to believe that this was as awsome as it looked in a border town charity shop, but my oh my, it is. Beautiful funky cream + chocolate plastic board and pieces. The battle sounds are beeptastic. 

I imagine that inspite of all the advances in computer technology in the last 30 years, there hasn&#039;t been an automated &#039;referee&#039; produced for any stratego edition since, which forces one to question - how far have we really advanced? The Generals - 1980 is my future!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>So far only run through a the first day a couple times solo. I am a sucker for Wallace, wooden bits, and Gettysburg, so this was a no-brainer. Quite similar to Yankees &amp; Rebels; the latter has a more detail on the regiments, plays slightly quicker, and I think is a bit more wargamey than this (which is inevitably tainted with Euroisms); but this has wooden soldiers! Need to play this against a human some day - soon I hope. 

Edit: Eventually managed two games against Mrs S (who unfortunately refuses to play again). I like it. The first game naturally fell into historical lines, so for the second as the South I tried all kinds of gamey unhistorical moves, and won at end of first day, I think. May be most interesting for South, and for players (myself included) who enjoy a good few hours of a game that brings to mind the historical situation, without getting bogged down in detail. Would be interesting if somebody workedout some maps and house rules for other conflicts, using the same lovely wooden pieces. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>I like the way that this plays, as a solo game. The player boards being an integral part of play, I find it easier to keep track of what&#039;s going on than with say Arkham. 

Not quick to play, but involving. I will get stuck into a game, and when I am at the verge of being beat take a look at the amount of cards still left in the ghost deck, and despair.

Wouldn&#039;t personally be inclined to try it multi-player.

The gatekeeper mini-expansion mixes things up a lot, and it seems like a small additional investment (in this case $5 from BGG promo store) can add a deal of variety to the game. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>A really promising design. Synthesises a lot of elements from Runebound, Magic Realm and Arkham Horror into an involving, epic and (at lower player counts) fast-playing game. In its current incarnation, my preference is as a solo or 2p game, but could play well with larger groups, particularly who enjoy cooperation. Lots of scope for expansions. Publish this soon!

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>Getting this knockd my interest in Wallace&#039;s London out - it is possible that there are only so many tableau-building card games one should own, and this is definitely one of them. It is the most interactive of any I&#039;ve played so far (with the possible exception of 7 Wonders, although I think it may just about beat that on this score too). And it is simply fun to play.

Also, I like the cartoons, the plastic box (which is compact and durable), and the lurid game colours ASSIST PLAY. Layout is clever, and the &#039;broken&#039; strategies also add to the enjoyment of this entertaining game. 

I probably prefer Race for the Galaxy with 2, but this is the better for more players.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I put a lot of work into learning the rules for this in the week before playing. I still don&#039;t quite know how the Hapsburg thing works, but on the whole it all makes sense once a game is under way. Came in a solid third, having failed to see which provinces were best to &#039;invest&#039; in on the first turn, or at least that&#039;s my excuse. Even getting solidly beaten was not unenjoyable, and I would like a chance to have another shot at this. Very headachey, though, and seemed a bit more laboured than Byzantium.</comment>				</item>

hell out of it after being &quot;turned on&quot; to it at a very crazy hippy party in a Moss Side tower block apartment in my misguided youth - about the only game I played in my 20s, apart from Risk ( until I got banned for boasting about cheating) and Shit Head. 

My wife loves this game even though it should not really be considered playable with 2.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Played two player and for two games: excellent, if anything exceeded expectations. It takes a while to play, but thanks to the rondel, feels very pacey. I won by arund £50 in the first game, lost the second by a similar amoumt, which I think is an interesting situation for a zero-randomness game. I certainly prefer Imperial/2030, but this is really a very different game, particularly as it plays 2 player so well, closer to the niche of Brass, Puerto Rico and Powergrid. Mrs S loves it. Plus it cost £7.99 at the works - bargain. Nice bits!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>My wife picked this up in a charity shop, and although I was aware of the following for this game, I foolishly thought that was just owing to the prepainted minis. The game system is really good - simple, but dynamic and rewarding of thought and tactics. Plus very flexible - when I start playing this with my kids, I may bother to knock up cards for all the minis I have from various other games. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Much of the production is very nice, but overall I suspect that this game may actually be bad. It felt bland to play, it looked like certain strategies were inherently stronger than others, and the race to victory doesn&#039;t seem to hold surprises. Is it the mythical goal of a &quot;1 to 2 hour civ game&quot; that dominated design here? For a less-intense-civ-than-TTA I&#039;d have to say Nations every time over this.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>If played a lot, I could get into this - have usually been voting for Powergrid for 6 players instead. Engineered myself out of controlling any countries for about an hour of the game, and still felt deeply involved, so there are certainly mechanics I like in this one.  Edit Nov 09 - played a 6 player game of 2030 which was very painful, owing to having misremembered certain rules and having a poor start. Hopefully have now experienced the worst of this game. Hasn&#039;t put me off, but it reinforces the merits of eg Steel Driver, which is at least over in a reasonable length of time. Curious about trying the 2 player game</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Definitely more of a wargame than Imperial. Presence of many more neutral countries mean aggressive (imperialistic) expansion can pay off big. Any aggressive military strategy is still at risk of boardroom aggression, however - nothing worse than seeing the prize shares in a country you&#039;ve built up going to a rival and profitting them.

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>Played at the end of a long day&#039;s gaming, with head a bit frazzled. Unsurprisingly given the circumstances, it didn&#039;t quite click. I can definitely see that improving with repeat plays. I completely misunderstood &#039;splaying&#039; until long into the game, so need definitely need another shot at it. The play experience combines Glory to Rome with Wallace&#039;s London. Choices didn&#039;t feel at all intuitive, which isn&#039;t typical for &#039;civ&#039; games, but again, this may well be owing to brain-fried-ness and unfamiliarity. Still, it seems you have to know the cards, and there a lot of cards to know. I don&#039;t think the same is entirely true with GTR, as that seems to me easier to see what is going on, and overall more funner. But first impressions can change, will see how I feel if I ever try it again. 

Sept 2015 Edit: Well worth persevering with. Now I have picked up a copy, am getting a lot of play of this with the missus. At first she was outraged by the various &#039;wrecking&#039; powers, but that only increased willingness to give it another try. Has taken over 2p slot for us - for how long? </comment>				</item>

Still, I think that the card-driven combat is none-too-shabby, and the &quot;Take that! And that! And that!&quot; element makes it very fun, as do the inevitable &quot;Death selling Umpty Candy&quot; &quot;Angel Gang littering&quot; mismatched crime situations.) 

One of Games Workshop&#039;s best. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Great solitaire card game.

Edit : Or so I thought as a kid, for some reason. But it is a decent game for 3 or 4 players, and stands up very well against a lot of modern card games. Similar in play to Grass and (presumably) Milles Bournes, with a he&#039;ll of a lot of care put into implementing the theme. 

A bargain for the prices one usually sees on eBay.  </comment>				</item>

I just don&#039;t get Zombie Dice, but this does have something like a game under the general excuse for silliness. Ridiculous RRP, though - no way I would pay over £15 - this is one that I am waiting to see turn up in the charity shops thanks to its relatively broad distribution. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>98</numplays>			<comment>The overwhelming merit is replayability. Random r elements generally make the game lighter but do also provide for interesting choices. Nice bits!

For 2 players I strongly recommend mantuanwar&#039;s variant where one kingdom card is face up, and each player has one kingdom card that only they know - but which both players will score from. It adds exactly the right amount of uncertainty and potential for bluffing to spice the game up - possibly making KB a better game with 2 than more. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I bought this BITD when GW published it. Loved it for the art (which in common with a lot of people it seems I incorrectly attributed to the designer Tom Wham) and the humour (definitely Wham). I think I also however appreciated it for the game play. This might have been the nearest to a traditional war game that I played the most back then (probably a good dozen to twenty plays 2p and 3p). Recently picked up the Z-Man edition cheap (£10) and am reminded how much I like this game. Which is quite a lot. Necessary variant - take turns making one move at a time, then resolve fights (but allow blocking as per rules, unlike other foolish suggestions here on the geek)</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>(After 1 play, 4 player) Enjoyable, would certainly play again, but would generally prefer to play Caylus, which this feels similar too, wioth most choice and strategic potential of any decision removed. The dice-allocation mechanic is quite fun with 4, but it doesn&#039;t feel like the randomness adds an awful lot of value to the game, which is fine. A good &#039;gateway&#039;? Maybe, but the apparently overwhelming choice of where to place dice, combined with the relatively low level of impact of good or bad decisions, might make this tedious if played between players of disparate skill levels. Nice bits, though. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Interesting little 2 player abstarct. Suspect that that the pompoustext describing the invention of the game as the &#039;world&#039;s simplest boardgame&#039; and how it is chock-full of strategy misses the fairly obvious point - it is impossible in the game to set up your opponent, and the best play can only ever consist of not playing the pieces so that your opponent  can block you, and not failing to take advantage when they have left themselves open to such a play. I don&#039;t think that this really weighs in ,much as far as strategic depth goes, and would make the comparison with Rubik&#039;s Tic Tac Toe, which really does have the capability for strategic depth (again, I suspect). Quite an enjoyable short brain-stretcher, though. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I like the Yorkshire Dales, Wallace games, wooden bits, so am happy with this, but could do with actually playing it some time. Next week, maybe.
(Edit Feb 2011):Finally played, 4 player. Very enjoyable, interesting decisions, seems like the random set up should add enough variety to keep this replayable. Maybe the auctions aren&#039;t important enough, there often didn&#039;t seem to be any particularly bad or overwhelmingly great choices, so little bidding up in our game - can see this changing with experience. 
Love the implementation of theme in this, although I am particularly disappointede that Penrith is just labelled &quot;The North&quot;, couldn&#039;t it at least be &quot;Penrith &amp; The North&quot; - damn you, Mr Wallace.The gripes about the board? Pfft. The colour choices don&#039;t particularly disturb me, and while I can see how it all could have been made a bit better with firmer, slightly thicker lines between spaces, a little more space in a few spots in the Dales, there&#039;s a lot of information and (in the case of the locomotives) actual prettiness clearly and functionally presented. A turn summary on the board would have been very helpful, and the game has a degree of fiddliness that begins with set up and continues through applying the auction results (surprisingly difficult to manage this simple task whilst fielding rules questions or answering whether sugar is taken with your tea), to making the calculations about how much track to build/sell - but the game for me was definitely worth this. It isn&#039;t as intense as Brass, nor as breezy as London - close in other words to Tinners Trail, but somewhat inferior to that in terms of elegance. The counter-intuitive way that profit works is extremely entertaining, and surprisingly difficult to get a grasp of at first, resulting in a pleasingly bitter &#039;aha&#039; moment when all your carefully orchestrated plans leave you with precious few VPs after the final round.
2014 Edit: My wife absolutely refuses to play this owing to the garishness of the board, which is very disappointing for me. At least the box is pretty, so it serves some purpose sitting on my shelf.Sigh.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>4</numplays>			<comment>I have seen the light - this game really is a solid challenger to DOminin in my estimation. Incorporates elements of Nightfall and Ascension - both of which I personally pretty much loathe - into the deck management and point chasing of Dominion. Loads of interesting interactions in this game - like the way you can have a feel for the strategies available in a given set up by the types of cards expected in each heroes cards - but no guarantee that the killer combos will end up in your hand. Really, really good as a competitive game, plenty of opportunities in most set ups to spite your &#039;allies&#039;. The master villain is such a great take on the Province Deck - victory points sitting outside your deck make decks generally more fun to play and less prone to choking, but there&#039;s still plenty of challenge in building a good deck. I think that people might have a bit less fun playing this purely cooperatively - would get too repetitive, be too long, and too easy - but maybe I am too competitive to appreciate that. Great design. The Punisher thinning out the Shield Agents in your deck being thematically explained as exterminating bent cops is one of the delightful little details. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Wallace does the card-laying-tableau-building thingy, and does it well. Surprisingly light, with a game length, load of vp calculating at game end, and dour art reminiscent of the old Ladybird books, that don&#039;t quite match with the lightness; so in all, a slightly odd beast. UI am guessing that at one stage before being simplified, the poverty cubes and other things actually went down on the map; the cubes and the board itself seem to be slightly out-of-place relicts of earlier incarnations. 

I think it&#039;s likely that I prefer the game that exists in a parallel universe somewhere in which the board and actual location of developments (and poverty) have greater significance - but I do find I enjoy this version all the same. 

As is typical with Mr Wallace, there are lots of very neat little ways that historical peculiarities and detail are worked into simple, abstracted mechanics. 

Enjoyed 4 player the most so far (feels very urgent) - 2 player is excellent, but poverty doesn&#039;t quite seem to work (maybe we need to use strategies that take on loads of pov early on).

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Used to play this solitaire a lot. 

Quite a lot of similarities to Magic Realm, without the clever but brain-warping ruleset. I think if the board had been mounted, this might have been considered a classic today. Not a bad game at all, well worth considering if MR is your thing. On the whole though, this is the kind of game system people persevered with before computers could do it better. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>An enjoyable game. I like the way that cards are physically played, with the keel oriented to the player who played the card - both a useful way of indicating which card is which, but also a mechanic that leaves the table looking like there are little sea battles going on all over it. The colours can be hard to distinguish in poor light in the cartoony edition, I think I would prefer the older, drabber style, was that Korsar? I see that the mechanic is listed as &quot;auction/bidding&quot; rather than &quot;trick taking&quot;, which makes sense now I think about it. This game is a classic Knizian combination of theme and mechanic, an aspect of his games that I suspect only elitist snobbery fails to recognise. Works with two, more fun with more, best with 3 or 4?</comment>				</item>

Picked it up for £1 in a charity shop - now I see what all the fuss is about. Great game.

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Very enjoyable play, but I would really be most interested in this as a solo game and:
1) I generally prefer solo games where you only need to play one hand, and the scenarios just don&#039;t support that much - so much of good gameplay in LOTR is dependent on getting synergy with party-members.
2) Deck-building is shockingly poorly supported in the core set, and I cannot see myself investing the kind of money needed to properly get into this game. 
Still, if my wife liked it as much as I did then I would happily jump in. The art and production values are great, to my eye. </comment>				</item>

Hard to imagine that anyone could even be bothered to play test this as it is practically unplayable. Roll dice, roll dice, roll dice, pick up cards, drop cards, roll dice... (1/2 hour later) play off a hand of cards, Sauron wins (or repeat earlier steps for another half hour, and another and another, and maybe the Fellowship will then win). </comment>	<conditiontext>In good but used condition.

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>I like D&amp;D, but the more &#039;Wonderful World of Dungeons and Dragons&#039; the theming gets, the more my toes curl. Waterdeep really takes the biscuit in that regard. This game would be so much more tolerable with even just a generic fantasy theming, if a more interesting theme or background couldn&#039;t be found. 

Anyhow, as a WP euro, its OK - it clearly rewards players who know the cards better (as do plenty of games, but there&#039;s something that feels very arbitrary about that here), but it&#039;s OK. I think in general, if I am going to play a Euro, I want it to be a really good euro, or else really quick. 

Impressive but weird production values. The success does kind of surprise me, but it is well-earned for the effort that has gone into this.  </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Initial impression after a 2p play: Plusses - Game play: plenty of decisions to make, even if they aren&#039;t always deep ones; if someone gets far enough ahead and someone else is far enough behind, then there are no real catch-up mechanisms: boo-hoo. Personally, I found the game still to be fun in an agonising way when trailing in the dirt and tackling the L3 monsters with L1 weapons. Edit after 3 further &#039;proper&#039; plays with 4 and 3 players: All this still holds. Have had one game with tense scoring and a close finish, and enjoyed another game where I played utterly hopelessly but still had a great time. 

Production: the art is atmospheric, and there&#039;s a bit of consistency, eg in the way magic effects are portrayed (with glowing magical symbols, much as in numerous fantasy PC games but rarely seen in fantasy art - I kind of liked this). Card stock is great, and the cardboard used for the chips and player boards is solid German quality. The box is one of the sturdier ones I&#039;ve come across too, and the insert&#039;s dividers are useful and look nice too. Plenty of room for expansion cards, neatly stored. Edit: All still good. Wish they&#039;d gone for more differentiation on card backs for equipment and monsters, would make it easier to organise (not a huge problem though).

Doubts, minuses: 
Game play: Is it a bit long, for what it is? May become a slog, but I actually thought the game length was reasonable, just that there are some quicker filler games that might have more depth. It isn&#039;t long, though. Edit: I&#039;m not finding it long, and am certain play would usually be comfortably under an hour with a little experience - for me that&#039;s filler territory. I think the pacing of the game is just right: doubt alleviated!
Might it be dependent on expansions for variety? I will compare here to 7 Wonders, which I like, but has the similar issue that you draft through every card, every game. You don&#039;t necesssarily go through every monster, so you can&#039;t count on knowing exactly what you&#039;ll have to face, but because there are multiples of each monster type, you&#039;ll soon have seen them all. To go back to 7 Wonders, i&#039;ve been happy to have some 21 plays without feeling the need to buy the expansions, even though the game lacks variety - if Lost Legions matches that I&#039;d say it&#039;s a minor issue at worst. 
The strong get stronger and the weak get stomped: As remarked earlier, boo-hoo. Does every game have to have catch-up mechanisms that effectively penalise the leader to keep the game artificially close? The question is whether the game is still fun to play if losing. Personally, after getting stomped in one play I still enjoyed it - but will this continue to be the case? Will have to see. (Edit: still enjoying getting stomped after 4 plays...)

Component issues: As with 7 Wonders (or even more so in this case), quite a price tag for a fairly small pool of cards. I would say that as with 7 Wonders, if the game is good enough, this is a non-issue. 
The cover art is a bit disappointing compared to the quality of the art in the game. Better than many other games, and miniscule as an issue for me.

Verdict: Yet to see, but promising after some initial doubts. It is damn weird to see Queen take on the Fantasy card game genre, though. Damn weird!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>I enjoyed my one play of this, which was a 2player game, the other player helping me along with learning the rules as I went. The biggest turn off for me is that you only cycle through your deck a couple of times. It feels as though this would be a game that you&#039;d get most out of solo, whilst yearning to have the multi-player experience with an equally matched opponent. Implements some ideas from Magic Realm well, and compared to that at least the rules are comprehendable, but I don&#039;t think this replaces its predecessor (nor indeed was it intended to, I&#039;m sure).
2014 Edit: Now, I own the game, have got more plays in and am liking MK more and more. It is one of those games that really sticks in your mind after play (or during if you leave a solo game set up) - thinking about different ways it could play out. A surprisingly wide scope of ways to play, both from the subtle variation of scenarios and the very different approaches that can be taken during the game. The degree of determinism in the design  fascinates me for some reason. I&#039;ve particularly enjoyed multi-player, which can get long, although certainly afternoon-able when playing Blitz. I&#039;m much less concerned about the limited cycling, which only becomes another strategic factor to consider when making card purchases - but essentially with MK, the &#039;deck-building&#039; label doesn&#039;t really fit: for me, a deck-builder needs to have deck-thinning and cycling as more significant considerations in play. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Difficult to rate... Has a lot going for it, scores highly as uniquely interesting, hell of an investment in time and effort to actually play it. Would probably take it to a desert island, can&#039;t see it getting much play otherwise. What&#039;s the rating for &#039;Outstanding game - too intimidating to even consider playing in most circumstances&#039; . N/A will have to do for now.
EDIT: April 2011 - Somehow, coming back to this after a hiatus helps, as does diving into RealmSpeak occassionally to see examples of the rules in play. Second time around is making much more sense, and I am enjoying this a lot more as a pastime and game, rather than as an acute mental workout. I am now considering trying to get this to the table with other humans - it can and must be done!
EDIT: April 2013. Two years later, I have again traded away my own copy, but got to play with ANOTHER HUMAN on the p&amp;p redesign. This is a great game. Set up and take down are frankly a chore, but it&#039;s worth the while, if only once every few years...</comment>	<conditiontext>Mostly in excellent condition - only played (carefully!) a few times.  Most of the character pad unused. Box a bit battered but not excessively for age.  

No original rule book present, and off hand I think there&#039;s one counter missing, a medium axe or something similar.

Limited trade interest - but would part ith this for maybe Space Empires 4X or possibly Mage Knight.</conditiontext>			</item>

Thanks to ebay and car boot sales I now have a stack of commons, and if I can ever persuade anyone to give it a try hope to build up a workable Cube. 

Edit July 2011 - have started playing with the cube I put together a few months back. Not bad.</comment>				</item>

Feels like being in one of those pictures on the front of an 80s family game box - look of concentration whilst placing a last piece, the others looking on with merry smiles.

My only play was in less than ideal circumstances, standing in for a player who dropped out just after the rules explanation, in a game of six players I think, where no one had played before.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Impression after first play: Interesting. Mrs S drew blood scratching my arm after I persuaded everybody else to donate mercenaries to block her attempted takeover of Russia on turn 1. This certainly seems to be a game with the potential to provoke hurt feelings... Negotiation is an essential element, of the type euro players usually rule illegal in superficially similar games. Similar in this sense to Intrige.

I ended up winning with around 200 points, my nearest competitor had about 100. I didn&#039;t control any countries for the last couple turns - early on, while other players went for more obvious targets, I surreptitiously cornered the market in metal, took a no-contest, 4 share payout, then continued to capitalise on this from a happy coincidence in the event cards I drew (including the &#039;immediate payout for metal&#039; card that I didn&#039;t know about before drawing it). After my second payout I became a target, following the third players went all out and worked together against me, but by then it was already far too late. Am interested to see how it plays with players who have an idea what to look out for, eg: in this game, if players had acted earlier, they could have taken metal shares themselves, kicked me out, or either left me holding the paid card, or otherwise made sure that somebody took a payout before the choice came back to me. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>Secret Thrifty Santa gift 2010 - thank you thrifty santa! Very much!

So far Mrs Schkff has actually even suggested the plays of this - quick playing time is a definite plus. 

I am very much enjoying &#039;wargames&#039; with card/dice driven command choices (Memoir, Yankees &amp; Rebels, War of the Ring). The division of the left, center and tright flanks feels a bit more limiting and artificial than command dice, but plays well as a game mechanic, and is thematic enough.

Intend to pimp my copy out with some Airfix 1:72 troops before too long. I can only imagine how I would have loved to own this game 30 years ago, and hope to vicariously enjoy that experience with my son in a couple years time.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>Although I wanted to like this anyway, it is continuing to grow on me, and I think I&#039;m seeing increasing depth, as a result of which I am enjoying the game more and more. Movement is a particular delight.

Haven&#039;t played the &#039;Standard Game&#039; - will probably try it eventually solo. I&#039;d like to figure out a way to use some of the nice bits for Standard in the Classic Game.

I never played the original, but have done my best to study up the differences. I am inclining to &#039;house rule&#039; that factory goods can&#039;t earn demand bonuses, as factories played very strong in our first few games and they seem to need to be trimmed back to the original edition&#039;s strength. Not sure about the missing orbit point - if it was left out for balance then the new edition&#039;s map might be worth sticking with.

FFG seem to have taken a bit of a kicking over this one. The differences between this edition&#039;s Classic game and AH PnP are minor and easily changed; the design is perfectly functional and it is nice-looking. I like the corny 50s/60s SF art of the original edition, but the cover is great on this new game, really in the spirit of the game, but different, and new. The board is entirely functional (although you do have to unfold it carefully). And maybe the Standard game is a mess (don&#039;t know, haven&#039;t tried it), but I am sure that eventually someone could come up with some neat variants by cannibalizing the pieces/rules.

The money is pretty crap, but entirely a non-issue for me - I have plenty alternative chips and money sets, so very rarely use the money in a given game anyway. Game designers - please do keep your printing costs down by including crappy money in your games, I implore you!

I would run out and buy an Ace Trucking retheme in a heart beat, though. 10-10, good buddies!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I really liked this. I don&#039;t know if the game length is justified though unless playing with people who like it at least as much as I do, otherwise it may begin to drag. For me, the combination of trading, adventuring, conflict, and the hazards of chance are all at about the right dosage. 9 times out of 10 I&#039;d recommend playing Merchant of Venus over it, though.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>I felt very well inclined towards this game owing to the large number of coloured cubes; after playing I have discovered that I am absolutely delighted by Merkator, which is filled from the beginning with interesting decisions. In spite of the obvious cube-shuffling agenda, I was surprised to read the many negative comments here, deriding the dryness and lack of theme. I find that the time element and the yeah generally the whole way that cubes sorry goods and contracts are handling is nicely thematic, but horses for courses I suppose. Here&#039;s hoping that the disdain means that I will be able to pick up a copy on the cheap before too long. Trade for London, anyone?</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I really like the card system for movement/combat/injury and exhaustion - very reminiscent of the chit system from Magic Realm, maybe even an improvement on it.

Overall, the design on this feels tighter to me than other FFG adventure games such as Android and Arkham. I was a bit disappointed that it wasn&#039;t set in a completely different time from the War of the Ring, but this is a decent game. Plenty of interesting choices for Sauron and fun for the heroes.   </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>From one 3 player game: a robust concoction of elements from Pathfinder and Mage Knight. Problems include down-time, numerous vaguely-worded effects and for me some of the bite of MK and the light fun of PF. Pluses include the sense of adventure, the variety of setup, the effort to create an integrated, atmospheric theme (charmingly reminiscent of Runequest). It&#039;s a decent effort, but falls short of both its progenitors for me. </comment>				</item>

Will try to hang onto this until my son (currently 3) is old enough to play. At the moment he LOVES playing with the monsters and tanks - who can blame him? so do I - but there really isn&#039;t enough game there for full adult attention. </comment>				</item>

Edit: Now that, thanks to the Works £7.99 sale I have a number of games with similar mechanics but nicer bits (particularly Royal Palace), this has dropped in my estimation.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>After only one play - so take this with a pinch of salt - but I am suspicious of the way the end game plays out. It doesn&#039;t feel right - and in my one play was down right horrible and disappointing. Discworld and A Study in Scarlet both seem to handle end game better in the faced of similar potential issues - and it may well come down to the lack of hidden goals of some sort - with the deterministic end conditions, players are either going to be stupid, fatalistic, or else drawn into tedious bash-the-leader jockeying. 

The rest of the game was great, though, and I loved the art and the place names. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Beautiful pieces, enjoyable meeting of anime and chess. Advantage over chess is that it has to play quicker, as players win goolyhoo stones for every capture. I think it&#039;s a mistake to view this as making a better game, but can certainly be more fun for lighter play. 

Great value for the current prices available (thrifted my set for 99p!)

Love the silly names- all part of the appeal. Real men pronounce the silent t in Dratp!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Very enjoyable area control game with a novel gift-giving &#039;auction&#039; mechanic. The Mongolian theme is very nicely applied (except, frustratingly enough, in the title). High production values, particularly with the inclusion of cameeples! Seems to be widely available at a discount - strongly recommended. </comment>				</item>

Does possibly seem (as with Mr Feld&#039;s games) that there might be so many different ways to score points that everything will work out nearly equally well - until players get experience with the system. A little less fiddly than Agricola, and with the swinginess of the cards removed, is how I feel about it. If we didn&#039;t already own Agricola and instead wound up with this, I think we&#039;d be quite happy with it. So for me solid, worthwhile, but ultimately doesn&#039;t quite set me on fire.

Thinking about this reminds me that the not-so-much-loved Mercator has the enormous benefit of simplicity/quick game time.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I suppose it is worth considering owing to the range of player numbers it supports, but I didn&#039;t enjoy this at all. Phoenicia is better balanced, if ultimately no less forgiving. Luck of the draw in the first half dozen rounds is crucial, and the range of values on resource cars can lead to brutal differences in players&#039; buying power. Waiting for people to count their card values or decide if they even want to bid in the auctions is tedious. Probably tolerable if players are all concentrating on what they are doing and have played it before. And does it always take forever? I thought I liked auction/economic games before playing this museum piece.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>50</numplays>			<comment>After playing two sessions (at the end of the second Lem slung a final, desperate spell and slew the dragon! Epic stuff!) I am very impressed with this game. 

The system of slowly evolving your character&#039;s stats and deck is simple but extremely effective and addictive. The designer of this game deserves all the accolades and glory for coming up with a way to have persistent characters and progression in a board game (ok, card game, but same thing). This is quite possibly the Holy Grail of adventure game design, and what springs from it We Shall See. Bravissimo!

I really am not keen on the LCG/expansion model for games, but I do think that anyone who buys into this will get themselves a great package and find good value for money. It seems to me that there is a hell of a lot of replayability in the base game - quite possibly in boardgaming terms infinite replayability - it&#039;s just that you are going to really want to take the adventure further and keep buying the adventure packs. If I was allowed to spend my money as I pleased (ie not married) then this wouldn&#039;t give me even a moments&#039; pause (but then again if that was so I&#039;d already have long since blown any cash on whatever was the hottest game/expansion series five years ago, and be up to my ears in debt, so I am not complaining, honest).

The game play itself may not be everybody&#039;s cup of tea, and that&#039;s understandable. Maybe the next game to come along which learns from this design will be able to come up with something more impressive in that area. But personally I have enjoyed the game play, and the simple but satisfying decisions and agonies over whether to play this or that card, and the little calculations about which combination of polyhedral dice gives the best chance at a positive result.

Please can somebody get the license to produce an Adventure Time version of this game, preferably standalone. I will buy that. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>(I only ever played this with the Mostly Harmless expansion included.)

There&#039;s a lot to like about this if you are looking for a space adventure game. Most of the production values are extremely good - I like the art, the graphic design, the thickness of tiles and the discs used for player pieces. 

The game&#039;s biggets flaws are a result of loosness of design: so if you are only interested in complete, rigorously-playtested, fat-trimmed games you should avoid this like the plague. 

To me, it feels more like a GM-less space RPG, including the need to fudge rules, make up interpretations on the spot, and to be more interested in the experience than winning. Drawing tons of cards every turn grew tiresome, altho I did like the general balance of what was on the cards, and think it reflected the source material (ie Elite computer game) well. 

The combat system is at first a little bizarre, but I am a fan of card-based systems eg the various ones in FFG games (Rune Wars, Star Craft). This is a worthy and novel addition to those, but not quite as tight, far less of a draw (more something that just works out as OK). 

A revised 2nd edition in about 5 years time could be really interesting. If you are looking for a game that is somewhere between Merchants of Venus, Eclipse, and Arkham Horror, this might be the game for you, especially if you are not afraid of making your own adjustments to get the game working better.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>It isn&#039;t my only criteria by many means - indeed I live lots of games that I suck at (eg Powergrid and Steel Driver) - but I find it hard to resist the charm of a game that I won first time. Go me. Auction / Civ building / Worker-placement - a nice balance of all three for a quick game, which has the merit of giving room for a runaway leader - god knows, if every frikkin game you play has 5 points between first and last place, it gets a bit tiresome after a while. Wooden pieces would be preferred, but the White plastic almost seems a bold and outrageous attack on convention. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>28</numplays>			<comment>This game makes me very keen to upgrade to a larger house, kitchen and therefore bigger table, so I can try out the full size version. Until then mini will more than do. Will start buying the expansions once the novelty of the base game starts to wear thin.
Edit : bought expansion 2, well worth getting. Hugely popular game to spring on non-gamers. My love for this game has only increased over time, which is rare enough. Also acted as a spur for me to try Carrom, which is superb. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>Bought on the strength of all the comments here which highlighted the speed of play, accessibility to new gamers, depth and variety of playing strategies.

What a great find.

Cracked it open when my brother and his other half were visiting (not exactly boardgamers, although I have previously subjected them to Talisman and Settlers at successive xmases). Game went phenomenally well, they loved it, my brother occassionally murmuring in stunned surprise &quot;This really is a good game.&quot;

Serious contender for my first &#039;10&#039; rating, although with my butterfly taste in gaming experiences, I am not sure that that is ever achievable by BGG criteria.

Edit : the novelty has worn off a bit as a 2 player, for which I would usually prefer to go for Hansa or Cartagena. Still think it&#039;s a first rate game for it&#039;s niche, which would be 3-4 players, fast play, accesible depth. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>I like Qwirkle. The colour scheme bugs me, although the game does at least play a good function in the colour-blindness department by helping raise awareness of how colour-blindness can affect a game - because when my tiles are standing up I am damned if I can tell the difference between blue &amp; green and orange &amp; red.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>452</numplays>			<comment>No other game in my collection has come close to Race for replayability. This year we finally mixed in Brink of War. It&#039;s seen steadily increasing plays between my wife and me year on year for 5 years now, which has got to mean something. If we&#039;re in a hurry, we can get a game set up and played in about 12 minutes, though usually we take our time and make it a luxurious 25 minute experience. And we&#039;re STILL noticing little details on the card art. Best game of 21st Century. If learning the icons is a struggle for you, it may be worth weighing that against the likelihood of getting hundreds of plays out of the game. </comment>				</item>

Obviously, TI theme is pants compared to Dune, but otherwise I think FFG did a good job. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An enjoyable, simple family game of global carnage. Somewhat tending to the overlong in the standard world domination variant - mission Risk usually brings the game down to within 2 hours. 

Played a lot with school mates in my late teens, I had the usual contempt for this game of people who have played better. Later boasted of cheating (which I very much assumed everyone was doing). As a result I have been officially labelled The Risk Cheater and banned from playing for life. Ironically, this has increased the pleasure I get from playing the game on odd occasions now (please be assured, there is no cheating ). </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This has all the faults of standard risk - except for play time. There are hints of potential strategy, but its a tough game to win if you get just a few unlucky rolls at the wrong time. 

But it also has all the attractions of Risk, and more (the shared bonus objectives are a touch of genius) - plus, the likelihood is that you&#039;re only ever going to find at most one other person up for a game of Risk in this day and age, so Balance of Power should be the automatic choice.

Added bonus: compactness, always a merit (and rare enough these days).

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>Need to try again - think that 2 player may work better with 2 armies each. Board is indeed very hard to read in lots of places, which is silly. Nice pieces. Great value as a thrift game. Ring movement mechanism is frankly wierd, particularly as delaying the Fellowship is just as likely to benefit the Good as the Evil side -  but a turn limit is useful in Risk. </comment>				</item>

And the little robots are cool, as are the various zone names : &quot;Optimus Prime and his robots are attacking Praetorius Wharf from their foothold in Nova Cronum!&quot; &quot;Just make sure he keeps the hell out of the Rad Zone!&quot; Wow!</comment>	<conditiontext>Still as new, all pieces present. Would preferably trade for some other Risk variant, as I would happily own the lot, but I suppose that one at a time should do. </conditiontext>			</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Nice production, fun game. I wouldn&#039;t really choose to play it over Race myself, but would be happy to play it if somebody else preferred it. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as deep, but it certainly isn&#039;t a throwaway game. My honest advice would be to buy Race plus one of the base+1 expansions (Gathering storm, Alien Artifacts) for the money, but I think the dice have a lot of plastic appeal for people at the moment. 

Was nice to see more of the original art, owing to the different shape of the tiles to the cards. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I found one 4 player, 5 hour play of this (epic rules, expansion included) extremely enjoyable, although I have a few reservations about replayability. Only fully realized the importance of questing towards the end of the game (a common mistake I understand); the randomness here, that one player could feasibly get 3 runes through the course of the game (or more?) whilst the others keep drawing nothing but duds has the potential of making a sideshow of everything else. If a player doesn&#039;t need to attack to get Runes then they could probably turtle with great effect. Nonetheless, it was great fun, I pretty much liked how all the various mechanisms played - simultaneous action selection, the dilemma of choosing action order, card combat, and so on. As is often the case with FFG, the mechanisms were all half familiar from other games - elements here of Game of Thrones, the first Warcraft boardgame, Runebound-in-miniature, Starcraft TBG simplified: For me, this is a great mix. I am very likely to swallow my reservations and spring for the reprint when it comes out, even if it only ends up seeing play once every year or so.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>From the few plays (which included house rules such as taking actions in turn rather than whole turns), this seems to be a really solid multi-player conflict game. The way you can inflict damage even if you lose a fight is nasty (a good thing of course),and the hand management aspect is very strong (again, possibly played with some house rules). </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>20</numplays>			<comment>We learned this visiting friends in Italy, and got quite hooked. The social aspect is definitely one of the things that makes it great - this does arise, however, as a result of the lightness which nonetheless includes gameplay elements that aren&#039;t entirely devoid of thought or skill. It feels quite like a modern light euro card game in that regard. Scopa!</comment>				</item>

The printed rules require a &#039;standard&#039; dictionary, which is an entirely different thing : you won&#039;t find qi or za in one.

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>What I like about this edition: Not having to set up the board, the board not being at risk of disintegration during play; the gloomy public domain Victorian bible art, and the &quot;Made in North Carolina&quot; banner; the &#039;building Jerusalem&#039; mechanic is a good addition to the game, allowing another way to score and ease trading, and acting as a game clock; the fact that the rules and components are pretty much otherwise vanilla Settlers; that you can use Cities and Knights and play &quot;Crusaders of the Holy Land&quot;.

What isn&#039;t so great: the black and the blue Jerusalem bricks are the most indistinguishable game components I have yet seen - in one sense this does provide for a deeply challenging bonus game, in most other senses, this is a bit of a silly oversight, to say nothing of the note offering $5 off other games in the stable as compensation for the tiles being too big (can I sue if I follow their Exacto-knife easy-alteration directions and slice off a thumb?); although the Jerusalem mechanic does something for it, this is hardly any more of a 2 player game than vanilla Settlers, especially as the map is non-customizable, and thus too big.

Would I buy this in place of vanilla Settlers? Being someone who only plays occassionally, yes, providing this were cheaper, which I believe it usually is. 

Overall verdict: this retheming fits really well, especially being built on a solid pun; I would be curious to see biblical reinterpretations of other popular board games... </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>I very much enjoyed this, my first and so far only block war game. I have a couple of ACW games at about this level of depth and (historical) strategic level - Wallace&#039;s Gettysburg, and the action dice driven Yankees &amp; Rebels. Can never decide which one to play and end up playing something else. The system here is easy enough to pick up, works, and provides a challenge. Not sure whether there is a lot of depth of strategic options for players or a lot of replayability, but for what it is, it&#039;s a decent game. I do appreciate little mechanisms added to games for historical colour - in this case literally historical colour, as there&#039;s rules for a rebel company (brigade, whatever) dressed in blue uniforms at risk from friendly fire. Eventually I will find another gamer with about the same level of mild enthusiasm for the ACW as me to play these games with...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I very much liked Wallenstein, I like this more - for the theme and for the extra elements which are all better (at least than 1st ed Wally). The map more prone to turtling, or to a player benefitting inordinately from a passive neighbour? Well, maybe a tad, although really that is a general weakness of both games, and I suspect it is only ever so slightly exaggurated in this edition. Players who are well matched, and who either all play competitively or all be happy to do their own thing should not have any issues. I do understand the feeling that the theme (and the awesome battle tower) deserve more conflict dammit, but I don&#039;t know if that could ever be the same game, and this is a satisfying game. See Samurai &amp; Katana for the theme with an appropriate level of bloodshed, negotiation and betrayal.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Fell in love with this game&#039;s slightly drab, classical aesthetic, which I still find very appealing today. A reissue should probably have smaller floor tiles and minis for the heroes, but no need to change anything else really. A solid dungeoncrawler, perhaps especially for solo play. Fun - frustrating when you keep falling down pit-traps and run out of tiles before you can work your way back to the exit, but no less fun for that. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>10</numplays>			<comment>I really, really like Space Empires - I like all the old skool elements (the chits really resonate with me from the chits in various sf themed pocket games I played back in the 1980s), I enjoy the economic planning and like having the record sheet as a record of the game. Combat is just great.

But... I think I would ultimately have preferred it as a 2player only game, and as a block game. The chits are damn fiddly. That&#039;s not enough to turn me off the game - and if I found multiple opponenents willing to commit to a game then the possibility for more players is worth having.

The game really realizes its potential with the expansion. The solo options are solid if you are looking for that. And the system is open to house rules and modifications if you are that way inclined. I think it is the best empire-building space exploration and combat out there, and a welcome throwback to the very best 1980s game design ethics (which are pretty solid, and by no means rendered obsolete in the 21st century).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>12</numplays>			<comment>Hybrid set - 3rd edition box, chits and board pieces, 2nd edition genestealers, and a mix of c. 1993 marines and terminators. 

Maybe I&#039;m biased owing to having had to make do, but I believe I vastly prefer the earlier minis because I don&#039;t really go for diorama poses on game pieces. 

Considering buying more board sections as they seem to be the cheapest component to turn up on ebay, with the most potential usefulness.

Hugely impressed by the quality of the board components. I never played the original: I imagine it was way out of my price range the first time around. I recall being deeply unimpressed by Citadel&#039;s early plastic miniatures, considering them a rip-off - not too sure now, as I generally find them much easier to paint (although they are undoubtedly a trifle light and brittle).

Everything I would want 40k to be - fast, simple and entertaining. Expecting that this one will see a lot of play over the years.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>This is a highly enjoyable game. It is certainly flawed - hoarding VP-boosting cards seems to be a very effective strategy that can hand a player a win seemingly out of nowhere, and game-end can be anti-climatic. But the scheming and the excitement over the gladiator fights are very enjoyable. I think it would ultimately benefit from some well-thought-out house rules, and some slightly more interesting betting options... But this is a good &#039;un - amazing quality for a TV-themed, low-priced game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>A neat game. Would personally preferred it just themed on Coal rather than the silly steam punk trappings (or to have more of an interesting injection of genre flavour). But a decent engine-building game in a small package.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>11</numplays>			<comment>Started out playing it on a tablet, which my son (age 7) really enjoyed - so picked up a copy at the UK Games Expo, and the physical game is going down even better. I enjoy this, he loves it - and he beats me a lot. Plenty of luck in the draw, but what I really like over Ascension (to which it owes an awful lot in design terms) is that cards aren&#039;t worth points themselves - so there&#039;s no disincentive to trim your deck. Can&#039;t argue with the price, or the convenience - wish more games followed the example for packaging and pricing.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Must dig this one out again. I seem to remember particularly enjoying the tribbles/trading game ; the Kobayashi Maru may now be somewhat overly-complicated for what it can offer compared to, say, a computer game. Not sure I ever played the Sherwood game, owing to the theme. [Edit after a few plays] The trading game could be reworked as a two player, could also be reworked to be playable - mechanics are fun but maddening. Sherwood Syndrome quite engaging, but too difficult playing by the rules as printed. Couldn&#039;t be bothered to set up Kobayashi Maru.</comment>	<conditiontext>Complete, used.

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Campaign game: Definitely better than Descent 2 - the adventures feel much more substantial, though they also have a weird truncated feel with how the scenario stops as soon as objectives are achieved, and it feels very game-y in those last turns in particular (&quot;Oh if we just do this and this, we can ignore those guys attacking us from all sides, and should win easy&quot;). Seems much easier for the rebels, but maybe it should be - at least does not have the no-brainer spawn the best monster and block strategy for the overlord. The miniatures are a delight; character development is fun. An impressive amount in the box. Don&#039;t like the Imperial Walkers owing to the change of scale, which is annoying. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>Lots that I really love about this game, but everyone seems to balk at the play length. Combat with it&#039;s deck-building, second-guessing, rewarding agression (somewhat tempered by the expansion?) is fun. Order placing ingenious. Bits are beautiful. Never played the computer game. 

Even though about 17 of the aerial vehicles came with their stands broken off, I could not bring myself to avail FFG of their legendary customer service, and instead just manned-up and got out the sand-paper and super glue - the production on this was such a clear labour of love, that it seems churlish to put FFG at any additional expense. Great game! (Scaling seems good too, - plays well 2 player) </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>To date, only played 2 player with the Mrs, essentially as learning games. Managed to confuse track points and track tiles on our first game, yet still found it very engaging. 2nd game using base game and half the US board went well, 3rd we use the whole board , which was more to the wife&#039;s liking; 4th we tried base rules but with paying for upkeep of locomotives, on a full board. This didn&#039;t work so well, we seemed to run out of options after making our choices in the initial rounds. 

Anyhoo, very nicely produced game, the Standard rules seem to have plenty if the cut-throat play that earlier incarnations are beloved for, the base game is, shockingly, a fun and accessible track building game. 

Looking forward to playing with 3 or more players. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>Really taken with this game - having now played Chicago Express but none of the other 13,000 similar train games, I&#039;m unsure whether this would remain a favourite. Clever play though, and fast. The less than flashy components do have the worthy advantage (over CE) of being less distracting, easier to absorb information from. &#039;John Henry&#039; cover has to be a bonus, even if it isn&#039;t reflected at all in the game play.</comment>				</item>

Edit : since buying, have to say I am really disappointed by the cheap matte cardstock. Feels like it would disintegrate after a few plays. Perhaps one reason there&#039;s not more love on the Geek. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>An interesting game. From my one play, and from reading comments here, this does seem to be a game where the experience risks being affected by a player not getting it or refusing to get it or just not putting any effort in. But it&#039;s interesting all the same. The room for bluffing and twisted negotiations is an interesting aspect, and it works very well as a hidden loyalties game for 3 (haven&#039;t tried it with more yet). I like the art and the production values all round - some card scould have done with more text more clearly explaining their uses and limitations. Needs explaining well, needs patience and concentration - I think there&#039;s the depth here to reward that. Ankh-Morpork is more elegant and accessible, but so far this looks much more interesting (although it would be less likely to hit the table in my house).</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>Nice dice and coins in this edition, slightly pointlessly bigger board (the inner region is especially a waste of space - the obvious place to dump your adventure card stack, suspiciously large enough to fit a whole extra board...).

I much prefer the old Gary Chalk and John Blanche art, but the new stuff is nicely done (notably inferior to Runebound artwork).

Nothing done to address the old balance issues to prevent the game becoming &#039;Gnomequest&#039;. Only innovation being allowed to collect Craft points -  which now creates a new balance issue of craft being too easy to boost.

FFG&#039;s tweaks seem to be a bit more thought through, and now there is a hope of decent expansions, maybe some life will be breathed into this fondly remembered game. </comment>	<conditiontext>Played but good condition - will consider a trade for 2e plus the Adventure and/or the Expansion in reasonable condition, or maybe Descent or something. Come on people, this edition has 6 dice with TALISMANS printed on and &#039;real&#039; gold pieces!</conditiontext>			</item>

Hated the art and Warhammer theme, but was very impressed that this was an edition where the expansions actually work together and make a fuller, epic game, rather than a colourful mess. Ugly as hell, though, especially the character cards.</comment>				</item>

It did seem just a little too dry long: as a beginner it&#039;s hard to do anything, so there&#039;s a feel of plodding along, that may or may not vanish with repeat plays. I would suggest Hansa Teutonica or Trajan instead. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Fun, young-person-friendly game. In spite of lacking much in the way of real strategic depth, the time management mechanic and the (thematic) fun of the chance-laden artefact draws combine to make play engaging. 

I think this is a neat combination of euro and AT sensibility : the theme is great, and although chance will play a big part in determining the winner, decisions feel real and meaningful throughout the game. 

Furthermore, if you&#039;re in any way a &#039;fan&#039; of 19th century cultural imperialism, well, this game really hits the spot. 

Should be sold in museums everywhere instead of the lame &#039;roll and move&#039; themed games they always carry in the gift shops - except then it would have to be called &quot;The Crazy Fun Treasure Quest Game!&quot;  

Very nice components (archaeological drawbags and Indymeeples) and very nicely priced too. Rulebook could be a bit clearer on certain points, although after a play and a re-read it&#039;s all pretty much common sense. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>8</numplays>			<comment>Sublime, intense, utterly immersing. Best with two or three, beat-downs can become unremitting and painful - going for a non-military strategy is a bold step, that must only be taken if you are prepared to be punished for it. It took me 6 years between first playing this game (and being absolutely blown away by it) and actually getting my own copy - the arrival of a new edition making this classic finally obtainable to incurable skinflints like myself. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>28</numplays>			<comment>The missus and my first game at the Liverpool Lions boardgaming club and a very enjoyable welcome to the hobby. Mrs F plays this obsessively online, I like it, but generally prefer to play something else. Prefer the variety of strategies to the original, but it definitely misses out on some of the elegant simplicity. Also, the stations make the game a lot harsher on beginners, and favour knowing the ticket deck.
Edit (Oct 2010): My opinion has mellowed, and I find I generally enjoy TTR:E, 2 players or more. My previous thought that stations are &quot;harsh&quot; on beginners may have been influenced by the game I played being a very cut-throat 6-player bash. Now I have played Big Cities from 1912 I really want to get the expansion </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>The edition we eventually bought, to satisfy my wife&#039;s love of the game and balance my own slight indifference. I like the fact that this edition comes with standard sized cards, the choice between long and short tickets, and the little passenger figures are cool : passenger mechanic adds variety to the game, is fairer to new players than stations, and of course can just be left out if you want to play the vanilla game and reward the longest track instead. Main disadvantage, when playing with passengers, is setting up time (extra 5-10 minutes) and general fiddliness of the goods markers. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>The authentic Football Manager experience, in cardboard form. Requires players to be sharp in calculating and recalculating their attack and defence scores, though this can (and really should) be done during the down time of other players&#039; turns. I think I would have prefered a simple draft rather than the driving around the city sub game, but that does its own job of making getting the squad you want a challenge.   </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>17</numplays>			<comment>I don&#039;t love Top Race, but I do like it. The thing is that I traded away Ave Caesar after getting TR, feeling that TR does everything AC does and more, which is true BUT

it is just more fun sending chariots around the track and hailing Caesar.

The game system here is cleverer than Ave Caesar, more of a game to get your teeth into and better able to scale (eg it plays perfectly well with 2) but for some reason I miss the roar of the crowd in the collosseum...</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>18</numplays>			<comment>Played this late in the evening at UK Games Expo, with a fried brain and sat with the board upside-down to me. As I actually did very well, I thought this was a very satisfying and well-designed game. 

The mancala is interesting - it drives your play and there are ways it can be exploited, ways it can trip you up. It ties in to three elements of the game - how you choose what action to take, whether you get a bonus tile (if available)  for the action you take, and how much you push the game clock on. Similar sorts of choices, decisions and benefits to rondel systems. At the moment |I&#039;m finding the &#039;push the game clock&#039; element to be of most tactical significance - forcing the early end of a turn can deprive your opponent of points, whilst you make sure to score easy quick points early on. It has the potential to be baffling or induce AP, but I found it pretty intuitive to use.

Components-wise the game is a pleasing package. There is a bit of set up and tear down involved owing to the million and one pieces, manageable in about ten minutes each way. 

The game (in my playing experience) it feels closest to is Village - multiple ways to score, manipulation of time and game length. Trajan is less novel and somewhat less interactive, but it feels as though there may be more to explore in the range of tactical options.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>I find the subject matter a big draw, and I am a sucker for the production of the deluxe edition, which is very shallow of me. Gameplay is tense and engaging. The main drawback of the game is that the players need to have about the same level of knowledge of the cards for the contest to be fair; but tht is where the long-term strengths of the game appear to lie, in the depth of strategy as the potential of card and board play are explored. Playing out the last century&#039;s struggles of the Long War that have shaped this one is an engaging way to spend an hour or two, especially with a glass of single malt whiskey to hand. May not be the greatest game of all time, but it does deserve its spot in the top ten.
Edit: It occurs to me from my misspelling whisky above that the US player really needs to be drinking Bourbon and the USSR player a good vodka. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>19</numplays>			<comment>Early impression: that the game is nice enough, but a little bit lacking in a certain spark, probably owing to the abundance of possible actions that have very close net end results. The test will come with replayability. 
After 4 plays - racing to score and kill off your family, balancing when to take the developing actions (growing family, making goods) and when to reap... We&#039;re finding the 2 player game to be fast (30 - 45 minutes - currently lasting about 3 full rounds) and so far promising sufficient variability - what actions represent the best opportunity will vary depending on the mix of cubes available and customers on the market. There&#039;s something fun about filling the grave slots (and interesting that that&#039;s just about the only blocking move available), and controlling when to kill the game is absolutely key. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>21</numplays>			<comment>Bought this to have a crack at painting the miniatures. Once finished, plunged in with the standard game, which went down surprisingly well with the missus. Beautifully produced game, clever and engaging mechanics. Knowledge of Middle-Earth geography and LOTR is very helpful, especially as map board is difficult to read once loaded with miniatures, but I didn&#039;t find the issues so bad as others. Took about 5 hours for our first game - had no idea how much time had passed. Exceeded expectations.

Shame about the lack of Gollum, Gandalf the White and Aragorn miniatures. Look forward to acquiring the expansion, hope the makers think up some other expansions or variations for the future. In many ways the core mechanics seem very similar to Blue Vs Gray - so a Civil War game or other historical conflict would be nice. This would surely be the mechanics and production values best suited to an epic Genghis Khan game!

I am honestly not obsessed with LOTR, but too many of the games are just so damned good.

Edit: upped rating to 10, which it is impossible to deny this game. </comment>		<wantpartslist>One dwarven regular wanted - dammit. Will pay cash money!

Most players had studied the rules a bit, so were reasonably well prepared for play. Wonderful the game changes through play, and surprising the way a real geo-political feeling somehow emerges. Not a million miles in feel from Imperial 2030, although by way of very very different mechanics. Also hilarious. Might get tiring to play too often, but I&#039;d be very happy to play this again. In spite of it being very tight (and me being the axis of evil for nearly an hour) I wore the balaclava fully. Hard core! </comment>				</item>

I very much like the wooden squirrels, shopping trolleys and Cartmans, and would enjoy playing this more often. 

The expansion seems to be a must, certainly adds depth without overcomplicating things. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Have long loved this game - played many games as a kid, quite possibly without ever finishing one. Tricked my wife into a 2 player game and to my surprise she loved it - turned out this may have had more to do with the continuous runs of bad luck I had in that game, as she was infinitely less thrilled when the dice turned against her on a seceond play. 

The assembly voting mechanic for two players works surprisingly well, and keeps this a very interesting game. For modern gamers, the main problem with Warrior Knights is the randomness - but this is of course built into the game to reflect the chaotic uncertainty of the period - that an army may be decimated by plague on the brink of success. It makes a win extremely difficult to predict, but likewise makes the game more about the experience of playing than winning. 

The other elements of the game seem very familiar when looking at the likes Puerto Rico and even Settlers - and for my money, Warrior Knights did this far better in terms of entertainment and, well, beauty of play. No pasted on themes here!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>1</numplays>			<comment>An interesting game. To contrast with the original: biggest difference is that although assemblies are important, it is not even a clear case for them being more important than any one other element - certainly they are not the single most important aspect of the game. And this is kind of disappointing, if unavoidable, and a little strange as so much of the game is familiar. The way that luck is handled - can be mitigated, is dice-less - is interesting. There is still plenty of the uncertainty, but it is far less likely that a random card draw or dice roll will suddenly reverse or finish the game. Money is less important, which was unexpected (eg, there is not a true auction for mercenaries). 

Combat is remarkably similar, but definitely one aspect that is more interesting in how it is handled - the drawing of cards, rather than the mere rolling of dice and consulting a result chart.This effects being more manageable whilst yet less predictable. Fate tokens, and the assigning of good and bad cards by the bishop, are the feature that I find most unappealing, they seem to spoil the theme, but, dammit, gamwise they work pretty well. 

The action selection and planning are a whole new game, and the long and short is that they are a very good implementation of this type of mechanic.  

Verdict: I&#039;d like to think that I would still prefer the original, although it may probably turn out that I actually enjoy this version more. I miss the rhythym of the original, and the fact that Warrior Knights 1.1 was all about the assembly - remember the drama of whether or not a Baron attended. But this was definitely engaging and enjoyable. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>9</numplays>			<comment>Rated after 2 4-player and 2 2-player games. 

So it&#039;s an area control euro &#039;disguised&#039; as a historical wargame. Works for me. The disguise is well effected, without compromising the game&#039;s very clear and straight forward euro roots. Simultaneous planning makes for plenty of tension, and so far each game has played out very differently. 

Particularly like the way factions work in 4 player - you can never quite trust your &#039;ally&#039;, but your interests will often be thrown together. 

As for the &#039;glorified rock-paper-scissors&#039;criticism - well, out-thinking your opponents and making calculated guesses is critical, and creates uncertainty without the randomness of dice rolling. A clever, elegant design. With a minimum of rules too, the game should be very accessible to people without much board-gaming experience.

Top-notch components, as one comes to expect from Z-man.

Curious choice for cover art, though. I get that the design is Australian, but Ayers Rock seems an unusual backdrop for mediaeval England.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>Because I did vastly better at my second game having learnt valuable lessons from my first, I can say that I like this. It appears that the game is prone to runaway leaders, but interestingly our first game was dominated by bankers, whereas in the second they barely paid back the setup investment. If players or indeed a single player do not pay attention to what others are doing and where the demand is in the economy, the sitaution can be ruthlessly exploited by others. 

On the whole I think I would prefer to play some other economic game, but this has its merits. Doubt it would be improved by takeovers and conflict. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>5</numplays>			<comment>Gameplay an enjoyable fusion of Boggle and Scrabble. Completing your first level four board with seconds to spare is a thrill : then finding that your first word (&#039;GIB&#039;) is in your imagination rather than your dictionary, so all those bonus points are suddenly wiped out... Entertaining, and with a well-engineered system to allow players of all skill/vocabulary levels to compete - although as previously noted, player interaction (as with Boggle) isn&#039;t really part of play. Nice components, too, although the drawstring bags in my edition are inexplicably labelled &quot;Sudoku&quot; rather than &quot;Wordigo.&quot;</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>13</numplays>			<comment>At its best, playing Yedo is an intense experience, richly thematic as you struggle to bring your clan to ascendency through nefarious plots and double dealing. The game mechanisms that implement this are splendidly crafted - there&#039;s randomness through shuffled cards and events - but ways to counter that randomness and even to make it work for you (through &#039;foresight&#039; actions). Spectacular gains and catch ups are possible - or you might get out front and stay out front, blocking your rivals at every step, consolidating your power base. Or, and this might be considered Yedo at its worst unless you have a particularly deep strain of masochism, the game can be a long sequence of frustrations at every turn, making little or no progress, every possible event that could screw things up just that little bit further getting drawn, every lucky break that could put your opponents ahead working out for them. I don&#039;t believe that this is a flaw in the game. When I&#039;ve had a truly horrible game (which pretty much sums up 3 games out of 8 played so far) the down turn in my luck was mostly down to a crucial poor decision on my part - a great goal discarded, an impossible mission hung onto for too long, letting an opponent in two player get the third and final geisha in the auctions (NB - do NOT let your opponent in a 2p game get the third and final geisha - do you really need to be told this?)... And only one of those three games was actually mostly a horrible experience to play. The possibility of total and utter ignominous defeat makes the glorious victories possible all the sweeter.

Comparisons: Superficially like Waterdeep because you are sending out workers and completing missions for veeps. The game which it most seems to resemble to me though is Mechanisburgo - another rich, intense and thematic WP. Significantly, though, Yedo has simple and intuitive rules, Mechanisburgo does not. The thematic depth should appeal to players who hate dry euroism, but with the chaos being quite manageable if you play it that way, the game should also appeal to players who enjoy a thoughtful, dynamic system that creates efficiency puzzles to solve. 

Play time: Two player takes 1 hour, with 3 - 5 the play time creeps up, maybe maxing out at 2 1/2 hours with 5 players who like to consider their choices carefully. For me 2 1/2 hours is by no means too long to be playing one game, and indeed the experience of playing Yedo is comparable to those games which usually take 3-5 hours to play - so I don&#039;t hold with the &#039;too long&#039; criticisms. 

Random nastiness: As noted, through using foresight actions, the randomness is all manageable I just don&#039;t see it as a fault at all. It creates an environment of risk - in which you may take chances or proceed with caution as you prefer. There are some great &quot;Gah!&quot; moments in this game. 

Take thatiness/blockinginess: A lot of opportunities to cause people hurt and to block people&#039;s plans. Again, I think the balance is about right. With 2 players it seems nastier because if you can get ahead then you can probably afford to just concentrate on stymying your opponent. Woe betide you if they manage to find a way through, though. At times then the game can feature INTENSE conflict and competition, but this tends to be periodic, generally not completely determining the outcome of a game (plenty of steps you can take, action cards you can arm yourself with to defend yourself against the ill-intentions of others) - the fact that it can sometimes be critical adds to the frisson of excitement that runs through the game - am I going to get royally screwed before (or worse just after) I get this game-clinching mission completed? </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>35</numplays>			<comment>Complete First Edition: I was always rubbish at playing Street Fighter, but I enjoyed watching my mates slug it out. Yomi translates SF to a form that I can actually play, and I so far am finding it delightful.

There&#039;s a lot that&#039;s impressive about the game. I love games that are simple to explain - though that means that the nuances in Yomi can translate as fiddliness - nonetheless, it should only take a quick bout or two for most people to pick the thing up - and the fact that it can be explained as Rock, Paper, Scissors - draw a card and play (then the nuances gone into as the game unfolds) is wonderful - though clearly a lot of BGGers have baggae associated to RPS (see most negative comments on this game for a sample). You can ignore RPS during play - you don&#039;t have to think about out-guessing your opponent - just try to make good moves with the cards you have. Sometimes you&#039;ll hit, and sometimes you&#039;ll be hit. Studies on RPS show that guessing randomly is the most effective strategy in that game. That simply ain&#039;t so with Yomi - because the value of any given card in any given situation is going to differ - with some characters a certain move will always be more likely, or more or less effective. It&#039;s very notable that the (consistently) top ranking players of Yomi are also poker professionals. Bluffing and reading bluffs are not the principal skills in professional poker - understanding the probabilities of any given card or play are much more significant. 

Anyhow, I like that you can take this game seriously and learn the decks and better plays, or you can just get into the fight and start punching and blocking as the whim takes you, or you can try get in your opponent&#039;s head and frustrate the heck out of them - any of which approaches to the game seems to be viable. Huge variability from the ten characters and corresponding match ups, and remarkable balance for the significantly differing powers, strengths and weaknesses. 

The designer&#039;s forthright and widely disemminated opinions clearly rub some up the wrong way. I&#039;ll take it as eccentricity. The design is unquestionably solid, and I for one appreciate that the game was designed as a whole, in a non-CCG, non-LCG model. Just like buying a cartridge of Street Fighter. I&#039;ll treat 2nd edition like SF II, and I guess if I get bored of 1st Edition some day, try and hunt it down. I&#039;ll happily try out someone else&#039;s 2nd edition, but I&#039;m happy to stick with 1st for myself until I am finished with it.</comment>				</item>
